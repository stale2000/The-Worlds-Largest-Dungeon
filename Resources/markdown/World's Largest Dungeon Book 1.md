AN INTRODUCTION TO 
THE WORLD’S LARGEST 
DUNGEON
HISTORY 
Millennia ago, the Celestials built a great dungeon. 
Within it, the celestials erected mammoth walls, 
locks, doors, and traps. It warded off those who 
would enter but also walled in those who would es-
cape: it was a dungeon larger than any ever known. 
Within it, the celestials imprisoned hellish undead, 
demonic beasts, and fiendish monstrosities. 
The prison was a perfect construction. Dizzying 
mazes and complex traps designed to confuse and 
keep the prisoners inside. Before the first dwarf was 
born to sculpt stone, angels, and celestials carved 
a work of art that no one would ever see. Perfect in 
every detail, it would stand inviolate for thousands of 
years. But none can say why the gods ordered de-
mons and liches to be entombed and not destroyed. 
The logic of their decision is beyond the intelligence 
of mortals, their plans an impenetrable fog of reason-
ing. In time, the gods would rue their mercy. 
Centuries passed, and the prison remained un-
changed. The champions who protected humanity 
from the liches and hezrou and pit fiends stood 
vigilant guard, ready to spend eternity in honor of the 
gods. But time passed over the celestials. The world 
forgot its heroes. Even the heavens turned a blind eye 
to the angels, inevitables, and guardians serving out 
their destiny entombed in the earth.
No one is sure how much time passed before an 
earthquake cracked the foundation of the dungeon. 
The rift spread for miles, nearly ripping the dungeon 
in two. Into the rift flowed lava, but it did not boil 
the occupants of the dungeon. The temperature rose 
beneath the earth, and the cold home of the unliv-
ing became capable of sustaining life.
It was not long before the derro came. They made 
their homes among the rocks and tombs. Many of 
the traps set throughout the dungeon had been 
triggered, and creatures that the celestials had sworn 
to entomb eternally had escaped. In time, more 
subterranean creatures would make their homes in 
the rock. All the while, celestials stood guard over the 
truest evils.
 Then, another earthquake pushed jagged earth 
through the dungeon floor, destroying a large por-
tion of its foundation. Driders and drow dug beneath 
the rock and rubble to make their homes. The same 
earthquake tore a hole in the ceiling, and flying beasts 
like the arrowhawk and belker perched on the highest 
plateaus of their underground sanctuary.
As the dungeon’s population grew, so did the ce-
lestials’ fear that mankind would be destroyed by its 
inhabitants. Two titans made the long journey to the 
mountain and stood guard at the entrance and exit to 
the tombs in eternal vigil.
Time passed. Few monsters made the climb down 
from the surface or pushed up from below. Only
 
the 
strongest made a home in the debris of the prison. 
Eventually, more derro came, bringing other diggers 
with them. When they required more room, the derro 
dug deeper.
The burrowing derro caused a massive landslide, 
bringing thousands of pounds of earth and millions 
of gallons of water crashing in. Hundreds of derro 
and duergar died, and the survivors moved deeper 
into the earth. Enlisting every manner of enslavable 
race, the derro crossed a giant chasm and started 
digging again.
Within the last hundred years, the dungeon has seen 
unprecedented activity. Every manner of creature lives 
in the dungeon. An elder treant and its elven entourage 
have made a refuge in the westernmost portion, while the 
undead have remained entombed at the northernmost 
point since the dungeon’s creation. The core of the dun-
geon (Regions F and G) show the greatest sign of conflict, 
with angels and devils waging a war that must end poorly. 
Lastly, the exit has seen a change of power that will stymie 
heroes who think they’re “almost done.”
The World’s Largest Dungeon represents years of 
adventuring. Do not tread lightly.

FACTS ABOUT THE DUNGEON
The World’s Largest Dungeon is malleable. It has 
been designed to serve your needs as a gamemaster, 
but this book is peppered with advice. Unless you are 
starting a fresh game world with fresh characters, you 
will have to do some work to wedge the dungeon into 
your setting.
The plan is for the dungeon to be in a mountainous 
region. It has been buried for countless years, and 
no humans have found it until now. There is a plot in 
Region A for bringing the PCs into the dungeon, but 
there are also 20 options on a chart on page 8. Tailor 
the story to your needs. And if you don’t like a Region 
of the dungeon or want to start with a different area, 
skip what you don’t like.
The maps don’t even need to connect the way 
they are connected. You are welcome to move 
them around.
The dungeon has one entrance for our design 
purposes, but it can have any number of entrances 
you need. If you desire more entrances, they should 
be well hidden or even guarded by relevant creatures 
(kobolds near the front, winter wolves along the cold 
northeast section, and so on). 
Because the northern reaches of the World’s 
Largest Dungeon have access to the surface world, it 
should be in a remote area, lest adventurers know it is 
here all along.
A chasm filled with lava — filled with mephits — 
pushes through the earth beneath the Dungeon. It 
must have a beginning and end point, which you may 
need to explain for setting continuity, but you may 
simply decide it remains under the earth, pushing up 
under a lake or sea bed, warming the currents.
The monsters in the Dungeon do not have children. 
There are no locations with baby ogres or yuan-ti 
eggs. If this does not mesh with your vision of a 
harmonious dungeon, we apologize. Killing children, 
whatever their species, faction, or identification, is 
not heroic. 
ECOLOGY 
Taken at face value, a dungeon housing over 1,000 
monsters is going to need a food source other than 
“the titan just eats the elves.” In all honesty, we don’t 
expect this adventure to be run from beginning to 
end. While it has been designed to be just that — the 
world’s largest dungeon — and it has a reason for 
being here, such an undertaking would break even 
the bravest GM and players.
Therefore, it is our contention that lichen, rats, gob-
lins, and dire boars make for an excellent food chain. 
In the lower levels of the Dungeon, goblins hunt the 
rats and eat them, and someone eats the goblins. 
Who? That’s up to you. As for the higher levels of the 
Dungeon, drop in a farm of dire boars, and you’re all 
set. Like all pigs, they’ll eat whatever slop you serve 
them, and chances are dire boars taste just as good as 
their real-world counterparts.
If your style of play requires more explanation be-
yond that, there are a few “magical” answers to help 
quell your need for realism. 
 
Underground springs of water provide all manner 
of sustenance. Time moves slowly here, so when 
most creatures do drink or eat, it nourishes them 
longer.
 
Because of the presence of the celestials, no one 
needs to eat. That’s why it’s such a hospitable 
place for monsters: there is less competition over 
resources.
 
Races trade with the fey. In exchange for not 
wiping them out, the nymphs and dryads provide 
edible lichen and other food. After all, if you eat a 
treant today, you’ll be hungry tomorrow, and then 
what?
 
At high enough levels, clerics can make food from 
nothing. Certainly, a goblin shaman could summon 
a plate of grubs for his followers.
 
The steam mephits provide magical sustenance to 
all who stand on the rocks of the Dungeon. (We 
don’t know exactly how that works.)
 
Certain races, like the driders, are experimenting 
with creature cross-breeding. Maybe chaos beasts 
or free-range chuul are tasty.
 
Cut the Dungeon into bite-size morsels and run it 
as separate lairs, each with its own passage to the 
outside.
 
Perhaps intelligent monsters are more nutri-
tious.
PRISON ARCHITECTURE 
The Dungeon was built to jail undead and demons, 
not to be comfortable. There are no barracks, kitch-
ens, or anything resembling “living” quarters. Squat-
ters have made do with whatever they’ve found here. 

5
Makeshift barracks do not afford the comforts of 
home. The PCs won’t find a logical pattern here.
After a few weeks of exploring, the PCs may start 
coming to their own conclusions about the Dungeon. 
If not, they can always run into a lantern archon.
LANTERN ARCHONS
One of the PCs’ best friends are the helpful lantern 
archons that may appear throughout the Dungeon. 
These celestials were assigned to know everything 
about their own dungeon, and some have survived to 
the present day. Each lantern archon knows why its 
Region of the Dungeon was created but is ignorant of 
conditions on other maps. These archons are a great 
way to dole out information to the PCs.
Lantern archons can be found anywhere the GM 
likes. They know many things they shouldn’t, like PC 
names, recent plunder, total dead in the area, and 
so on. They are not there to tell the PCs what lies 
beyond a door but rather to point them to the 
Dungeon’s major plots. Their original purpose 
was to watchdog the Regions, but since the 
earthquake, each archon has grown sullen 
(and perhaps a little lonely), taking on a per-
sonality of its own.
All of the lantern archons believe that 
Region O is the only exit to the Dun-
geon and that Barcellus (Room O59), a 
titan loyal to the celestials, guards it. 
They do not know that Barcellus has 
been replaced. See Region O for 
more details. 
Feel free to give each archon 
a unique voice. Alternately, 
ignore them altogether and 
have the PCs find their way 
through the mess.

THE DUNGEON ENVIRONMENT
SCALE 
Scale is a bit of a mixed bag here. In the original 
printing, the maps needed to be at least six feet tall 
(marketing demanded it) when fastened to the wall. 
As such, there were limits as to how big the Region 
maps could be. The original intent was for the dun-
geon to be many square miles. But if you examine the 
map, it’s a lot less than that. 
As such, the maps were initially designed to be 5-ft. 
by 5-ft. squares, which was also the baseline for the 
third edition. However, making them 10 ft. by 10  ft. 
squares, in fact, gets the size of the dungeon closer to 
the original mark. However, that makes a lot of these 
hallways gigantic. So, there are a few suggestions on 
how to apply scale to these maps.
The simplest answer is the maps are not to scale. 
They give a general idea of the placement and size of 
a hallway or room, but the GM is free to mix things 
up however and whenever. When the mapping 
doesn’t line up, that’s on par with what the celes-
tials intended.
All of the squares are 5 by 5 or 10 by 10. Done. Don’t 
worry about it.
The space under the mountain does not match 
the space on top of the mountain.  It doesn’t have to 
make sense. It’s magic.
Region H is problematic when you try to ascer-
tain how remote this prison is. If the PCs never visit 
Region H, it is irrelevant. Alternatively, Region H is 
10 miles east of where it appears on the map. Prob-
lem solved.
The passageways between Regions (maps) are very 
long. Add a few hundred feet here and there. 
Doing any of these requires some different visual-
ization, but none of it reduces the dungeons’ playabil-
ity. There are still rooms, doors, hallways, monsters, 
traps, and the occasional treasure.
SIGHT 
Keep in mind that the Dungeon is completely dark. 
Except where noted, there are no sources of light any-
where inside the Dungeon. This environment does 
not present a problem for most creatures, who rely on 
darkvision or blind vision to find their way. Of course, 
while darkvision or blindsight allows the creatures to 
see, there are distance limits.
Unless the party is composed entirely of races that 
have darkvision, the PCs must rely on light sources 
to find their way. Aside from illumination problems 
(torches burn out, light spells end), having to rely on 
light sources presents a huge handicap in sections 
where other creatures can see in the dark. Outside, 
a torch can literally be seen from miles away on a 
moonless night. Inside a dungeon, low ceilings and 
tight corridors reduce torch visibility to 100 ft. or 
so. Nonetheless, any attempts at stealth, including 
surprise, are ruined by a simple candle as watchful 
creatures likely spot the light source long before it 
becomes visible.
Nothing attracts unwanted attention in darkness 
like a source of light. Regions H, K, L, M, the eastern 
edge of N, and O all have slightly different lighting 
conditions. Higher ceilings, holes in the mountain 
tops, and other conditions make these Regions differ-
ent from the claustrophobic tunnels of the remaining 
dungeon. Review these chapters and make sure the 
PCs understand how high the ceilings are.
SOUND 
Sound doesn’t travel as far as the PCs might expect. 
While the Dungeon is not soundproof, the walls are 
very thick, muffling the screams of the demons in 
their cells. Wards were added to soften their annoy-
ing, persistent echoes. Years of neglect have caused 
these wards to warp, creating an unplanned new 
effect. Sound is unpredictable.
This means a lot to clever GMs. If the PCs are extra 
quiet, perhaps a single breath gets funneled down a 
quarter mile of corridor, alerting everyone of the PCs’ 
presence. Or an epic battle in a room two doors away 
goes unheard. Echoes from the farthest reaches of 
the Dungeon could be heard at the entryway, and the 
PCs’ footfalls could go unnoticed by someone right in 
front of them.
Don’t be afraid to use this to your advantage or to 
help low-level PCs sneak past larger adversaries. Drop 
hints of things to come or disguise an ambush wait-
ing to happen. It is important to note that Regions 
H, K, L, and O do not follow standard rules regarding 

7
magic, wards, and — in this case — sound. Feel free 
to apply these concepts as you see fit. 
TRAPS 
While most of the original magical traps have long 
since failed or been destroyed when the creatures 
imprisoned here escaped, the celestials maintained 
a number of other traps up until their departure to 
Regions E and G. Although they are usually in areas 
of strategic importance, traps are occasionally found 
in unexpected places. 
Many traps were designed only to paralyze the un-
dead and demonic forces that could not be destroyed. 
Others produce cold and/or fire depending on 
whether they were designed to kill devils or undead. 
Acid and sonic traps were effective as well, bringing 
many creatures to their knees. However, because 
of the nature of the undead and demonic beasts, 
someone always had defenses against something. As 
a result, a variety of traps were made, many of them 
magically capable of resetting themselves.
Over the centuries, many creatures have stumbled 
through these corridors, tripping glyphs, spells, and 
fire traps. The hardest ones to spot have already been 
tripped, and some never reset. The ones that have a 
marking were circumnavigated once the first hobgoblin 
was turned into a rat or doused with flaming oil. The 
easiest ones to spot have been avoided. That said, traps 
can be anywhere the GM wants to place them. Doors, 
columns, and secret panels could be trapped. Anything 
a demon might fiddle with to escape the dungeon could 
be trapped. Feel free to add all manner of non-lethal 
traps whenever the whim strikes.
Note: Corridor traps slow down gameplay. A project 
of this type requires them to some degree but be 
merciful and give the PCs a chance to spot them 
passively without the rogue calling out for searches 
every 20 feet.
OTHER 
Because the original builders had little need for 
creature comforts, the Dungeon has little in the way 
of furniture or standard dungeon decor. The occa-
sional workbench or forge might exist, though. These 
Regions are geologically unstable. So, while an actual 
collapse is not going to happen with the PCs inside 
the dungeon (unless you want one), the occasional 
rumbles and tremors are common. These rumbles 
can be anything from a minor nuisance to a real haz-
ard. If the random encounter tables do not include 
them, feel free to add them when things are slow.
INTERIOR DOORS AND WALLS: THE 
SIMPLE ANSWER
Unless otherwise stated, all walls are stone, and all 
doors are iron. 
Iron Door: 3 in. thick; AC 19; hp 30; open lock DC 15. 
Stone Wall: 3 ft. thick: AC 17; hp 50; break DC 30. 
Due to the Prison’s superstructure, even a small 
section of broken stone causes no lasting damage. 
Only a force on par with a cataclysmic earthquake can 
damage the foundation.
INTERIOR DOORS AND WALLS: LOCKED 
DOORS 
A number of doors in the Dungeon are locked. This 
makes the Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) proficiency very 
handy. In fact, PCs shouldn’t enter the Dungeon 
without a rogue and a set of thieves’ tools (lockpicks). 
As a GM, you have to decide if you want certain doors 
to be easier or harder to open. Apply advantages and 
disadvantages however you see fit.

 8
INTERIOR DOORS AND WALLS: STAN-
DARD DOORS 
Unless stated otherwise in the Room or area text, 
a standard dungeon door conforms to the follow-
ing rules. 
If there is no description of a door, it is closed but 
unlocked. How long and tedious would this be if they 
were all locked?
It is made of wood and bound with iron.
Iron Door: 3 in. thick; AC 15, damage threshold 12; hp 
90; break DC 21; open lock DC 15. 
It opens in one direction only but has pull rings 
on both sides. All doors push open into the Rooms 
from the hallway or from the previous Room unless 
otherwise noted. In case of a conflict, the decision is 
up to the GM. 
Although heavy, it is well anchored on common 
hinges and can be opened by any creature of Small 
size or larger simply by leaning on it. Doors can only 
be pulled by a creature able to grasp the ring. Crea-
tures of Tiny size or smaller do not have the mass to 
pull open a door, even if they have the strength. 
Doors are neutrally hinged and do not swing open 
or close on their own. A closed door stays closed, and 
an open door stays open unless purposely shut.
There is roughly a half-inch gap between the 
bottom of the door and the floor, allowing air, light, 
noise, and smells to escape. Most prison/vault doors 
are sealed completely.
INTERIOR DOORS AND WALLS: SECRET 
DOORS 
Unless stated otherwise in the text, a secret door con-
forms to the following rules.
If there is no description of the door, it is closed 
and of stone or whatever material the wall is made of.
Stone Door (stone wall section): 3 ft. thick; hard-
ness 20: hp 200: break DC 28.
It pivots on a central, vertical axis by being pushed 
on one or the other end. Because they are much heavi-
er than standard dungeon doors, secret doors require 
a successful DC 15 Strength check to push open or 
closed, and the following special size modifiers ap-
ply: Gargantuan +12, Huge +8, Large +4, Medium +0, 
Small -4, Creatures of Tiny size or smaller do not have 
the mass to push open a secret door, no matter how 
strong they are. In addition to these modifiers, any 
creature that is on more than two legs or is otherwise 
exceptionally stable gains a +4 modifier.
Unless noted, discovering it requires a DC 16 In-
tellegence (Investigation) check. In more advanced 
regions, this number may be as high as 20 or 25, per 
the GM’s discretion.
Unless noted, it has no locking mechanisms and 
thus cannot be locked, nor does it have a return mech-
anism. Secret doors remain open if opened or closed 
if closed.
They are six feet high by seven feet wide. When fully 
open, secret doors are completely perpendicular to 
the wall. There is roughly three feet of maneuvering 
space between the secret door and the wall. This is 
large enough for a single creature of Medium size to 
squeeze through on either side simultaneously; crea-
tures of Large size or larger usually cannot fit through 
such a space (although whether they actually can or not 
is ultimately the GM’s call and depends on the physical 
characteristics of the creature). The door sits one foot 
off the ground on a threshold to allow for the pivot, a 
fact that also makes it more difficult to detect.
Secret doors are built to very tight tolerances. There 
is a slight gap at the top and bottom through which 
air or noise might pass. Because of the thickness of 
the secret door, this gap is not large enough to allow 
light through.
Pushing a secret door open causes the stone to 
scrape slightly and makes the same amount of noise 
as a person in medium armor trying to stealth (DC 11 
Wisdom (Perception) check to detect the noise). 
Some encounters have special conditions or rules 
that make it harder for the PCs to defeat the mon-
sters. Some are contingent upon room conditions, 
magical effects, or sometimes sheer game balance. If 
they are hurting your games, ignore them. They are 
here to add elements to combat the PCs cannot plan 
for. Anyone who wants to kill an orc already knows 
their armor class and hit points, but what if they can’t 
plan for certain bonuses or tactical benefits?
After all, monsters don’t want to die. They will do 
everything in their power to stay alive. They fight 
from vantage points; they ambush the PCs when they 
can; they use numbers to their advantage; they flee 
or surrender when death is imminent. And since the 
monsters aren’t stupid, be prepared to kick the PCs 
around a little until they learn this. And if that doesn’t 
work, add a few Encounter Conditions of your own.

CEILINGS 
The dungeon ceiling is sometimes as low as 10 ft. 
and sometimes as high as 50 ft. (or more). Each 
Room and hallway is different. The GM may decide 
how tall each Room is or roll once per Region, Sec-
tion, or Room to determine the ceiling height.
If you need details, consider rolling for each Room. 
Or just roll when you think it will be relevant.
D20HeigHt

202d6x10 ft., or 1d20x5 ft.2d6x10 ft., or 1d20x5 ft.
Outside the “dungeon” proper, where the stonework 
juts out from the earth, the Regions are more cav-
ernous. In such places, the ceilings rise as high as 
four miles. 
TELEPORTATION AND EXTRA 
DIMENSIONAL TRAVEL 
The walls of a prison are useless when its inhabi-
tants can just phase out of existence and reappear 
on any plane they wish. The celestial knew this and 
surrounded the prison with a null field, negating 
extra-dimensional travel and teleportation. Any magic 
that allows the PCs or creature to gate, jump, or 
phase from place to place is negated. Creatures that 
have teleported into the dungeon (accidentally) find 
they cannot escape. 
Since the earthquakes, pockets have developed 
throughout the complex where the null field has 
weakened or disappeared completely. The text ex-
plains exactly where, but Regions H, K, L, and O are 
the weakest in this regard. Additionally, some maps, 
such as A, E, F, and N, have teleportation built into 
their design. The maze-like nature of Regions E and 
F makes the random teleporters that much more 
devastating.
The GM may decide that creatures like barghests, 
shadows, blink dogs, and so on have limited range 
of motion on the ethereal or shadow planes, but they 
can never entirely escape the prison. Spells like di-
mension door, if allowed, only work to line of sight or 
100 feet (whichever is less). Bags of holding, portable 
holes, and the like lose their link temporarily with the 
dimension in question. Stored items inside a bag of 
holding cannot be accessed, and items added fill the 
bag as though they were a normal item.

 10
EXPERIENCE POINTS AND TREASURE
Let us explain some of the logic before getting into 
the advice.
From beginning to end, this dungeon has over 
1,600 encounters. Using the logic of 15 encounters = 
one level of advancement, the characters would reach 
level 107 when they finally exited the dungeon. And 
Dungeons and Dragons doesn’t go to level 107. Nor 
was either edition designed that way. That means that 
XP and Treasure cannot be handed out at the same 
rate as a typical dungeon.
You’re probably not going to like this, and certainly 
the players won’t, but this is an eventuality of some-
thing called the World’s Largest Dungeon. There are 
solutions, but again, these are only highly suggested. 
We can’t hover over your game table and make sure 
you’re doing it right.
Level advancement should happen at milestones. 
You know when the PCs have cleared a dungeon 
one-third of the way. Grant them a level increase, and 
don’t think too much about it. Give out XP as nor-
mal, as you like, but only use the map Regions that 
advance at the same rate as the PCs. If the PCs are 
level 7 when they exit Region A, then Regions B and 
E should be removed from the dungeon, leaving 
the PC to advance to C, F, or I.
Instead of tackling it in one big go, just run each 
Region as a stand-alone adventure. Regardless, each 
Region tells you the levels the PCs should be for 
them.
The same goes for treasure. The dungeon purposely 
has scant amounts of gold and magic items. There 
are so many routes for the PCs to take and so much 
advancement that could happen, the PCs would be 
running around with 10 +3 swords if we followed the 
regular flow of magic items. As such, the GM will 
need to hand out trinkets and prizes here and there, 
roughly one-third as often as normal. 
Note: There is some treasure here, but it is rare.
Region A has a built-in story about how the PCs are 
roped into this adventure. However, you may decide 
to start somewhere else, or you don’t like that story 
because it requires a little bit of front-loading. Either 
way, the following chart is a quick-start way to have 
the PCs inside the dungeon in no time.

18I can’t believe you’re still reading this list.
19Region A is so much better now.
20Seriously. Stop reading.
Each map (or Region) has a theme. Divided by ob-
stacles, territorial markings, secret doors etc., Regions 
can be divided into separate adventures or linked in 
one grand campaign. While each chapter explains its 
role, this is a short overview of each section.

11
BASIC OVERVIEW
Region A: Orcs, kobolds, and extraplanar creatures 
fight for territory. At the heart of the conflict is a 
wererat bent on controlling the entire Region. This 
introduction suggests to the PCs that something is 
going on in the prison. Levels 1 to 3. 
Region B: A series of traps guard a fractured goblin 
empire. Hobgoblins, bugbears, blink dogs, and a 
false king. Levels 4 to 6.
Region C: Almost as chaotic as it is ordered, Region 
C unites many classic dungeoneering themes: 
traps, puzzles, and unique monsters. Region C is 
also a dead end, and unless the PCs recover the 
special key in Room C 105, their trip here will go 
for naught. A black dragon trapped inside the maze 
and an ancient spectre make up two of the Region’s 
finales. Levels 7 to 9.
Region D: One of the most important plots of the 
entire complex, the derro are the source of most 
problems in this dungeon. Now, a xill and his min-
ions have enslaved dwarves, duergar, derro, grim-
locks, and all manner of burrowing creatures to free 
an entombed evil. Levels 14 to 18.
Region E: One of a handful of celestial outposts in 
the Dungeon, the inevitables and guardians strug-
gle for “authority” while monsters from Region J 
and the outermost portions of Region E break down 
their defenses. A number of creatures in this Region 
(insects, shadows, etc.) reduce the PCs’ ability scores 
with their poisonous/draining attacks. Clerics will 
need spells like lesser restoration to survive the jour-
ney. Levels 4 to 6. 
Region F: The most complex maze in the Dungeon, 
this Region is controlled by three opposing mino-
taur tribes, each being played against the other by 
a manipulative rakshasa-medusa team. Randomly 
teleporting gates make this Region nearly impossi-
ble to map. Levels 7 to 9.
Region G:  The heart of the Dungeon and the most 
important struggle to save the PCs’ world from ex-
tinction, Region G is the location of the final battle 
between the angels and demons. Levels 9 to 11.
Region H: Elf guardians and dedicated fey stand vigil 
around the “first tree,” fallen into the Dungeon 
a few centuries ago. This is the most roleplay-
ing-intensive Region. Here, the PCs can affect the 
Dungeon on a different level than the high-fantasy 
conclusions of Regions D, G, and N. Levels 11 to 13. 
Region I: Tied to Map M, this Region is home to all 
the aberrations and “things that should not be.” 
Concerned that the creatures could escape into Re-
gion E, the inevitables built wards to keep them in, 
but the tide of war slowly pushes against the PCs. 
Levels 7 to 9.

 12
Region J: Based on dungeon crawls of old, this 
Region has puzzles, trapped statues, and tribes 
of monsters living elbow-to-elbow. With a nearly 
impossible finale, the Region will have PCs visiting 
again and again. Levels 13 to 15. 
Regions K and L: These two Regions are intricately 
linked. Another by-product of the derro dig, this 
lake and adjoining swamp are the result of the 
landslide that dropped the two-mile-high ceiling 
into the Dungeon. Throw Region H in for a com-
plete campaign adventure all its own. Levels 11 to 13 
and 13 to 15.
Region M: Tied to Region I, Region M is the most 
conflicted of the maps. Drider masters perform 
horrible experiments on their drow slaves, tossing 
the aberrant remains into Region I. An exit to the 
mountain peaks above the Dungeon promises es-
cape for those who can fly, but the cloud giants and 
flying beasts that control this Region have their own 
plans. Levels 9 to 12.
Region N: The largest and most impenetrable part of 
the Dungeon, the Tomb of the Unliving houses a 
three-way war between a lich, a mummy lord, and 
a ghost. Millennia of war have sculpted the land-
scape of this tomb, but none of these beasts have 
yet succeeded in releasing the terrible World Eater. 
Levels 14 to 18.
Region O: The climax to the Dungeon holds yet 
another twist. While the PCs may or may not know 
about the titan guarding the exit, the frost giants 
have enslaved the Region’s occupants and taken 
control of the exit. They are not pushovers, and 
PCs thinking the undead were the final piece of 
the puzzle are in for a rude awakening. Because the 
PCs can race to the end, this Region covers Levels 
16 to 20. 
Reading the Encounters
Each encounter is written in the same general format. 
Each opens with the number and name of the Room 
followed by pertinent information on running the 
encounter.
If there is specific information about the door or 
entrance to the Room that GMs should be aware 
of before the PCs enter, it can be found before the 
Read Aloud Text. Additionally, if there is a trap or 
something of note before the door, it is mentioned 
here. Some encounters happen in hallways, so be 
alert for them.
Read Aloud Text. It is recommended that the GM 
paraphrase or relay this information in his own 
voice, rather than read it aloud verbatim. This text 
relays to the players what they see, hear, and sense 
about the environment.
Initial Attitude. Attitudes for NPCs and monsters 
are Hostile, Unfriendly, Indifferent, Friendly, and 
Helpful. Few in this dungeon are Helpful. Hostile 
attitudes are hard to change, and monsters that are 
assigned to guard duty rarely change their minds 
about attacking.
Encounter. This is the meat of each Room, and 
includes the Room’s history, details of the envi-
ronment, monsters, traps, and so on. If a Room 
is completely empty, there is still a short descrip-
tion to give the GM something to improvise. If 
a monster or NPC is present, its hit points are 
listed. If the encounter refers to creatures from 
another part of the dungeon, it lists the Room 
they are from.
Encounter Condition. This is a special section. 
Written in shorthand, these notes point the GM to 
the charts explaining exactly how to conduct the 
battle. Not every encounter has a special condi-
tion, but feel free to add them to taste. Sometimes 
Encounter Conditions exist for encounters that are 
not violent. Details are still provided should a fight 
break out, or should the PCs try to sleep in a haunt-
ed chamber.
Tactics. Sometimes generic, other times Room spe-
cific, the tactics of a given monster are explained 
here. Sometimes the Tactics section helps a GM 
understand the contents of the Room, how to open 
a secret door, or what the best course of action is. 
Tactics is a catch-all when the Encounter and Trea-
sure sections don’t fit.
Treasure. Be careful not to read this aloud until the 
PC s have taken time to search the Room. Because 
there are over 1,600 Rooms in the Dungeon, no 
matter how much or how little treasure we as-
signed, it was going to be the wrong amount. Care-
fully weigh whether or not the PCs need another +1 
longsword; would the campaign be better served 
with a potion of healing instead? Don’t be afraid to 

13
give out less treasure at the start of a Region, antici-
pating greater rewards at the end.
Scaling. Each encounter with a monster or trap 
includes tips on how to make the encounter easier 
or harder. The GM should feel free to ignore this 
section or embellish each encounter as he sees fit.
The GM is always free to increase DCs. Increasing 
the DC is as simple as saying “the stonework is very 
dense”, or “the pervading darkness and low ceilings 
make it hard to see.” 
This book is a great big toolbox, and you are the 
craftsman.
Encounter Conditions
Some encounters have special conditions or rules 
that make it harder for the PCs to defeat the mon-
sters. Bear in mind that the monsters don’t want to 
die; they will do everything in their power to stay 
alive. They fight from vantage points; they ambush 
the PCs when they aren’t looking; they use numbers 
to their advantage; and they flee or surrender when 
death is imminent.
None of the monsters in this dungeon are stupid. 
Be prepared to kick the PCs around a little until they 
learn this. And if that doesn’t work, add a few En-
counter Conditions of your own.
Encounter Conditions listed in [brackets] are not au-
tomatic. Some are optional while others are contingent 
upon something in the encounter. Read the Encounter 
thoroughly to note the difference.
Ambush: The monsters have advantage on all Stealth 
checks prior to Initiative.
Ambush (darkness): The monsters have advantage on 
all Stealth checks prior to Initiative and attack light 
sources from a distance and then attack the PCs 
from darkness, taking advantage of their darkvision.
Bog: Area is considered difficult terrain. Dexterity 
checks and saves are made at disadvantage. Ev-
ery torch or other flame-based light source has a 
50% chance of going out; roll once for each source 
at some point during the encounter. If someone 
carrying such a light source goes prone the light 
source is automatically extinguished.
Concealment: Monsters in the Room are considered 
lightly obscured unless they are adjacent to a PC. 
While obscured they have the benefits of half cover.
Concealment (total): Monsters in the Room are con-
sidered heavily obscured unless they are adjacent 
to an PC. While obscured they have the benefits of 
three-quarters cover.
Cover: Monsters in this Room maintain full cover 
until they are adjacent to a PC. While in full cover, 
they have advantage on Dexterity saving throws and 
cannot be targeted by attack rolls.
Cover (soft): As Cover, but the cover does not grant 
advantage to Dexterity saving throws.
Cover (total): As Cover, but unless adjacent to a PC, 
monsters have three-quarters cover while adjacent 
to cover, regardless of PC sight lines.
Cursed X: Something isn’t right about this Room. Its 
inhabitants are slightly unhinged or its walls seem 
to sag with an undefinable sadness. The longer 
PCs spend in this Room, the harder it is for them 
to leave. Increase the DC of all Wisdom and Cha-
risma saves by X while in this Room. Monsters or 
PCs already suffering from madness do not suffer 
this penalty.
Deep Darkness: This Room is cast in perpetual mag-
ical darkness that cannot be dispelled. Torches and 
lanterns give off ½ their normal light and magical 
light requires a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell 
level) or it is extinguished.
Deep Silence: This Room is cast in perpetual mag-
ical silence, as per the silence spell, that cannot be 
dispelled.
Desecration X: Add X to undead saves against effects 
that Turn Undead.
Diseased (Name) X: For every minute the PCs spend 
in this Room, they must succeed at a DC X Consti-
tution saving throw or contract the named disease. 
Even diseases that normally are only contracted 
through ingestion or injury can be contracted in 
this Room.
Distracting Noises: There are noises in the darkness 
that cannot be explained, Nonetheless, they can af-
fect the wandering minds of PCs. Similar to Echoes, 
this Room also imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom 
and Dexterity saving throws, as well as Concentra-
tion and Perception checks. PCs must succeed on 
a DC 22 Constitution check in order to gain the 
benefits of Short or Long Rests in this Room.

 14
Distracting Visions: Something is waiting in the 
darkness, or the shadows play strangely on the 
walls. While in this Room, the PCs suffer Disad-
vantage on Initiative rolls and Attacks of Oppor-
tunity. PCs must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution 
check in order to gain the benefits of Short or 
Long Rests in this Room.
Drafty: Open flames, such as torches, each have a 
50% chance of being extinguished at some point 
while in this room.
Echoes X: A great deal of noise and distraction in-
creases the DC of all Perception checks by X.
Extreme Cold: Anyone remaining in this Room for more 
than 1 minute begins to suffer the effects of cold. 
Casting spells in the cold is difficult: teeth chatter and 
fingers shake. Casting a spell in this Room requires a 
successful Constitution check (DC 8 + the spell’s level). 
The cold can be magical or natural.
Extreme Heat: Anyone remaining in this Room 
for more than 1 minute must succeed on a DC 
12 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of 
exhaustion. PCs in medium or heavy armor have 
disadvantage on the roll. The heat can be magical or 
otherwise. This stacks with other sources of ex-
haustion, but can only add up to 3 points (4 for PCs 
wearing heavy armor) and fades after 30 minutes 
outside of Extreme Heat.
Fear X: An inexplicable pallor of evil permeates this 
Room. PCs must succeed on a Wisdom saving 
throw (DC equal to X) or be frightened until they 
leave the room.
Fearless: Monsters and NPCs are immune to the 
Frightened condition, do not negotiate, and do not 
flee. Effects like dissonant whispers still deal damage 
but do not force the target to flee. Undead cannot 
be Turned, but on a failed save still suffer damage 
equal to the level of the cleric.
Flooded: These Rooms have become flooded by a 
higher water table or some magical effect. Area is 
considered difficult terrain. Ranged Attacks and 
Dexterity checks and saves are made at disadvan-
tage. Every torch or other flame-based light source 
has a 50% chance of going out; roll once for each 
source at some point during the encounter. If 
someone carrying such a light source goes prone 
the light source is automatically extinguished.
Fog X: Everything in the Room X feet or further away 
is considered heavily obscured.
Hallowed X: This Room is holy. Clerics and Paladins 
gain X bonus to all Charisma based skill checks and 
undead and fiends have disadvantage on all sav-
ing throws.
Haunted: Rest is impossible. PCs can spend hit dice 
during a rest to regain hit points, but otherwise 
gain no benefits from resting.
Hazardous Footing X: The floor is covered in de-
bris, rocks, glass, or sharp objects, or it otherwise 
impedes movement. PCs moving more than half 
their speed must succeed at a DC X Dexterity check 
or take 1d4 damage for each 5 ft. they move that 
round. Small and Tiny creatures have advantage on 
the Dexterity check.
Invisible: For some magical reason, the monsters in the 
Room gain the benefits of invisibility until they take 
an Action (attacking, casting a spell, etc.) that removes 
this benefit.
Negative Energy: Undead heal 1 hit point per hour 
in this Room. PCs lose 1 hit point per minute in 
this Room.
Poor Footing X: All (ground-based) monsters and 
PCs have disadvantage on melee attacks unless they 
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10 + X).
Positive Energy: PCs heal 1 hit point per hour in this 
Room. Undead suffer 1 hit point of damage per 
minute in this Room.
Safe: This Room is generally safe and might be a good 
place to rest. Reduce the chance of an encounter here 
to 1/6
th
 the normal rate of Random Encounters for the 
Section (e.g. if Random Encounters are rolled every 
hour, they are rolled every 6 hours in this Room).
Smoke: The air in this Room is thick with an un-
breathable smoke, either from magic use or a 
recent fire. A character who breathes smoke must 
make a Constitution saving throw each round (DC 
13, +1 per previous check) or be Incapacitated until 
the start of their next turn as they spend the round 
choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 
2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonle-
thal damage. Many creatures that do not breathe 
(demons, aberrations, etc.) use Smoke to their 
advantage.
Spell Resistance: This Room is guarded by wards 
and spells that dispel all magic cast within it. All 
occupants have advantage on saving throws against 
spells and other magical effects.

15
Stagnant Air: As Smoke, but instead of taking dam-
age, a character who chokes for 2 consecutive 
rounds is considered Poisoned. Many creatures 
that do not breathe (demons, aberrations, etc.) use 
Stagnant Air to their advantage.
Submerged: The Room is completely underwater 
and the PCs must swim across it. The PCs must 
have some way to breathe water to remain in this 
Room, or they will begin to drown.
Tremors X: A tremor shakes the Dungeon, drop-
ping stones on the PCs. PCs must succeed at a 
DC X Dexterity saving throw or suffer 2d6 points 
of bludgeoning damage at a random point in the 
Encounter.
Unhallowed: This Room is unholy. Clerics and Pala-
dins have disadvantage on all skill checks.
SUMMONING MONSTERS
It’s bound to happen. A PC realizes that nothing in 
this dungeon ever leaves. The magic of the prison 
holds it on this plane. “ I can spend 14 days summon-
ing badgers for the big battle, right?”
We don’t feel good about the answer GMs are 
going to give the PCs on this one, but here goes. PCs 
shouldn’t have access to summoning spells. It’s game 
breaking. We can’t eliminate conjuration magic en-
tirely, even though, by the backstory of the Dungeon, 
it shouldn’t work at all. Now. There are workarounds. 
Summoned monsters are pseudo-magical and turn 
to goo or something when the duration expires. 
But that’s more explanation headache on your part, 
should the PCs push back on the ruling.
There is one way to stop the wizard with 400 bad-
gers around her, and that is to eliminate control of 
the monsters once the summoning spell wears off. 
The badgers turn on the wizard or run off into the 
dungeon on their own.
And do we have to say this? Summoning monsters 
to turn around and kill for XP is worth nothing.
Our suggestion is to not have summoning work at 
all. Tell the players they can choose other conjuration 
spells, but anything that brings a creature into the 
dungeon does not work.
Demons and devils still retain their demon-sum-
moning abilities. This flies in the face of what we’ve 
just said about summoning spells, but there’s a game 
balance reason for this. The XP and challenge rating 
of the demons is based on their ability to summon 
allies. For some creatures, it’s all they have.
But if they can summon other demons and devils, 
why haven’t they summoned more to them to help 
break out of their cells?
DEMONIC SUMMONING
Demons are unpredictable. They don’t follow orders 
well, and no one needs sixteen lemures hanging 
around and screwing up their master plans. Addi-
tionally, there is limited space in these cells, and 
summoning another demon into your Room is just 
stupid. Some demons are already elbow to elbow. 
And while demons feed on chaos, one could guess 
that after 4,000 years of being trapped inside a dun-
geon cell next to Bob the Eternal Jerk, “summoning” 
Rob the Endless Moron is going to make the scen-
ery so much worse.
Most of the devils are trapped in Region D, where 
there is no more room. Also, the devils in the Dun-
geon have an attitude problem. They often don’t 
work well with others and know that another devil 
of equal power is going to rival it. Finally, imps are 
useless in high-powered regions of the Dungeon. 
Summoning one as a scout would be like delivering 
a free pizza to your neighbor.
MAKING IT WORK
It’s all about the fun. While a great story will always 
be remembered, a series of great evenings is all we 
could ever ask from a product of this scope. We en-
courage GMs to make things challenging, heroic, and 
epic, but above all, fun. A lot of people put a lot of 
work into this book, and if you don’t gain some kind 
of enjoyment from it, then we’ve failed.
And we don’t like to fail.
So sit back, relax, and enjoy what will be the best 
(and longest) gaming experience of your lives.

MAP ZERO
The following locations do not exist on any map. 
Rooms Z1 and Z2 appear before the PCs enter the 
tunnel. Included below is also location Y1, the magma 
flow that cuts through the Dungeon. 
Lastly, Rooms W1 through W20 are empty Room de-
scriptions that the GM can swap in and out through-
out the Dungeon. 
Z1 - Z2 . A TITAN DIES
Depending on how the PCs find out about the Dun-
geon, these encounters may not be necessary. They 
are provided for convenience and present important 
themes for GMs running the entire campaign. 
There are no Random Encounters in this Section.
Z1    . THE TITAN
As you climb the mountain, rocks and debris slow 
your ascent. Numerous tracks of different creatures 
ascend the hillside. Some you recognize. Others... 
The climb levels off as you get closer to the cave 
mouth. You see a humanoid figure the size of a 
galleon lying on the ground at the cave opening. 
As you get closer, you can see that death has taken 
him. Despite his obviously decomposed state, 
the man does not exude the odor of decay. There 
are no signs of a struggle. Who was he, and how 
did he die?
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The body of Breysus, a dead titan, lies at 
the opening of the World’s Largest Dungeon. For 
centuries, he stood guard at this doorway while his 
brother guarded the other side of the mountain 
(see Room 59, Map O).
Tactic: N/A
Treasure: His Gargantuan halberd and Huge chain-
mail are not much use to the PCs. Even if they 
find a way to carry these items, the armor only fits 
Breysus. Though they are made of fine steel, neither 
the halberd nor the chain shirt can be cut down to a 
useful size, though the links of the shirt could con-
ceivably make an excellent chain for a ship’s anchor.
In his pockets are a millennium’s worth of 
notes and scribbles written in an ancient language, 
totaling over 500 lbs. of appropriately sized writing 
materials. Some are strewn about the area, having 
been scattered by various creatures looking for 
something of value. Other notes have been taken 
away by the wind.
He has no gold, no gems, and nothing 
else of value.
The notes are written in an ancient form of 
celestial. If the PCs can ascertain their meaning, it 
will take days to get through it all. Most of it is a 
stream-of-consciousness note taking about Brey-
sus’ day-to-day observations. One in 50 pages talks 
about the nature of the prison and the honor he 
and his brother have been allowed to guard this 
entrance. Another one in 100 pages talks about the 
demons and devils held captive inside. Nothing 
specific, as he does not know the manner of their 
captivity, only the brushstrokes of what the pris-
on represents. Some of the pages talk about the 
earthquake, but he never went inside to see the 
effects of it. He died before Longtail came through, 
so there is no mention of the creatures that now 
occupy Region A.
Scaling: N/A
Z2 . THE TUNNELS
Beyond the titan’s body is a single cave mouth, too 
dark to see what it hides.
Should the PCs examine the cave, read further.
The cave is low and shallow, obviously dug by 
small, crude hands. Many footprints mark the dirt, 
and debris litters every corner. In the back of the 
cave, a narrow tunnel, poorly lit, winds down into 
the earth.

17
If the PCs explore into the tunnel, read the following:
The tunnel winds into the mountain, its ceiling 
some 6 feet high and 5 feet wide at most. After 
about 100 feet or so, the tunnel opens into a larger 
chamber, cut from stone and built rather than dug. 
It is obvious that something lives here.
Encounter: This tunnel leads to Room A1.

EXITS
If you look carefully at the maps, you’ll see that Maps 
D, H, L, M, and O all hint at something “beyond.” 
While Maps H, M, and O are designed to be exits, 
Maps D and L have potential exits left to the GM’s 
imagination. It would be close-minded to create a 
dungeon of this magnitude without leaving room 
for the GM to expand. In fact, another book could 
be published with potential exits and surrounding 
environs. Where would it end, exactly? Would the PCs 
be over level 20 when they got there? 
It is up to the GM to decide whether or not the PCs 
can use these exits.
East of Region D: Some of the tunnels running east 
of the Map are perfect places for new adventures, 
a whole new campaign to begin, or a route to the 
surface. How far do those tunnels go? How long is 
the route to the surface?
East of Region H: While technically, the PCs can 
‘fly’ out of the top of the Dungeon above this 
Region, the elves guard their steeds carefully. PCs 
with the ability to fly can go straight up and out of 
the Dungeon.
East of Region L: How far to the east the lake extends 
is up to the GM. Perhaps it’s another 100 feet, or 
perhaps channels extend for miles underground, or 
to another dungeon entirely.
North and west of Region M: While we haven’t 
defined the Dungeon beyond the borders of the 
map, the GM can either have the cavern dead end a 
few hundred feet up or perhaps there is a series of 
twisting tunnels at the higher reaches of the moun-
tain. This could mean another adventure trying 
to get out.
North of Region N: The tomb by itself is completely 
walled off, but it’s up to the GM how far the cavern 
around it extends.
Region O: The obvious exit is here. PCs who defeat 
the frost giant who has taken over are sure to find 
the real exit to the Dungeon. In addition, the ceiling 
above Regions H, K, and L is open... a few miles up. 
The PCs can escape from these locations if they are 
so inclined and able.
X1 . MAGMA FLOW
The following location in the magma flow cuts 
through the center of all the maps and is described 
here for ease of reference. This description fits the 
magma flow in every Region.
The flow of molten rock meanders to the southeast, 
consuming all it touches. Bubbling up from the 
flaming river are occasional pockets of scalding 
steam, shrieking and moaning, disrupting the 
earth’s quiet. Though the flow is indeed hot, it is 
bearable, and when you watch the floating bit of 
rock flare into flame, you can see multitudes of 
small imp-like creatures playing in the stream, 
tossing balls of flaming slag at the dancing clouds 
playing on the fiery river’s surface.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent 
Encounter: After the earthquake shattered the 
Dungeon’s foundation, opening a rift extending 
for miles, something strange happened. A small 
stream of liquid rock slowly filled the chasm created 
by the quake. It wore away the caves that underlay 
the Dungeon’s foundation, collapsing enormous 
sections of the magma below and further widening 

 18
the gorge. As the magma filled the bottom of 
the rift, it stranded many denizens on small rock 
islands amidst a sea of fire. Understandably, the 
temperature rose. Though the heat warmed the 
complex, it was somehow survivable. No toxic 
fumes wafted from the flow’s surface, just steam as 
water from the tiny cracks and fissures poured into 
the burning river, creating patches of semi-solid 
rock on its surface. Stranger still, the creatures in 
the Dungeon could approach its shores without 
suffering from the extreme temperature. Because 
of its unusual properties, the complex could sustain 
all forms of life.
Of course, there is nothing natural about this 
dungeon, and the odd properties of the flow 
surprised no longtime inhabitants of this place. 
In time, it became clear why the molten rock did 
not fill the caves with poisonous fumes and lethal 
temperatures: the force of the earthquake had 
interacted with the Dungeon’s magical properties 
to tear open a permanent gate in two of the Inner 
Planes: Earth and Fire. Liquid fire and a river of 
earth poured out of the gate, and when the streams 
crossed, the magma was created.
On the Elemental Plane of Fire, the tear attract-
ed a lot of attention. The native magma and steam 
mephits investigated the gate and watched where 
the liquid fire blended with the flowing earth. Like 
moths to a flame, fire, magma, and steam mephits 
passed through the portal. To their horror, they dis-
covered the gate was one-way, trapping them in the 
cold caverns of the massive complex. Worse, they 
could not warn the other mephits, who continued 
to spill through the gate, trapping more and more 
of their kind until the chasm filled.
Hordes of mephits came through the tear, 
but they found the frigid Dungeon inhospitable. 
The mephits gathered in and around the magma 
flow, with steam mephits lurking near the surface 
and magma mephits swimming through it. These 
outsiders absorbed the heat emitted by the molten 
rock. The steam mephits, thriving in such environ-
ments, contained the toxins and poisons.
Now, the mephits rarely leave the security of the 
magma, which allows other creatures, including 
the PCs, a chance for survival. The mephits have 
been here so long they are no longer interested in 
getting back to the Elemental Plane of fire and are 
content to spend their days mindlessly basking in 
the magma’s heat. They do not communicate with 
other creatures and attack only if some fool falls in. 
Fortunately, the effects of the mephits on the 
magma reduce the severity posed by this environ-
mental hazard. Falling into this magma flow does 
not deal the normal damage. Instead, the magma 
deals only 21 (6d6) points of damage to unprotect-
ed characters each round, insulated as they are 
by the mephits who swim through it. Victims are 
still subject to drowning rules as described in the 
GMG. In addition, a swarm of magma and steam 
mephits attack any victim who falls into the flow. 
The number of mephits attacking each round varies 
as the flow carries them onward. Each round, 8 
(1d10+3) magma mephits attack submerged PCs, 
or 4 (1d6+1) steam mephits and 4 (1d6+1) magma 
mephits attack PCs floating on the surface.
Encounter Condition: Extreme Heat 
Tactics: The flow does not go in a single direction. 
It bounces back and forth, swirling through the 
Dungeon core.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge, double the num-
ber of mephits that can attack the PCs. To decrease 
the challenge, have them arrive every other round.

NOMENCLATURE
We used a few keywords to make reading 
this a little easier.
Map. There are 16 maps in this dungeon. 
They can be cut into smaller lairs for in-
dividual adventures or brought together 
into one campaign. 
Random Encounter. Every Section of the 
Dungeon has its own Random Encoun-
ter chart. These are usually rolled every 
hour, but they can be altered to taste. 
Region. An entire Map and its contents 
are called a Region. There are 15 Re-
gions in the Dungeon, with Region 
N being twice the size of the others. 
Each Region has its own chapter in this 
book. While Region and Map are nearly 
synonymous, they are not interchange-
able terms.
Room. The place where the PCs are 
standing. It can be a 10 ft. by 10 ft. cube. 
Or it can be a 100 foot wide cavern. So 
long as there is an encounter there, it’s 
a Room. Every Room is numbered. If it’s 
not numbered, it’s not a Room.
Section. The territory that the monsters/
creatures/NPCs occupy. “Rooms K1 
through K24,” for instance, is a Section 
of the Dungeon. Some rules affect an 
entire Section, or certain Random En-
counters may occur only in that Section. 
A Section comprises many Rooms and 
should not be confused with a Region.

has been thoroughly mapped and detailed, every 
GM will find that they want just a bit more detail. 
These Rooms are here for that reason and may be 
used at the GM’s discretion. 
W1 . EMPTY ROOM ONE 
A thick layer of dust covers the floor. Two toppled 
pedestals and the shattered fragments of a marble 
statue of an elf lie in the center of the room. As 
you watch, the marble head shifts slightly, and its 
eyelids flutter open. It stares at you with startling 
blue eyes for a moment, and then the eyelids 
close again.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room contains the remains of the 
victim of an ancient trap. The trap is no longer 
active, and the only thing the elf can do is shift her 
face slightly from stone to flesh.
Encounter Condition: Haunted
Tactics: A spell like stone to flesh changes her back, 
but her memory is so fragmented that she is of no 
use to the PCs. She can answer one question per 
PC with a 10% chance of accuracy.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: N/A
W2 . EMPTY ROOM TWO 
An inch-thick layer of muck covers the floor of the 
room, and a dozen closed doors dot the exterior 
walls. Deeply charred runes in an unknown lan-
guage mar the center of each granite door, and 
geometric mosaics of green, red, and yellow tiles fill 
the area between each door. The ceiling is covered 
in bronze discs, each six inches wide.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The majority of the doors are false doors. 
The runes and mosaics were once traps that re-
leased streams of acid from the ceiling and fired 
lightning bolts from the runes, but these traps were 
activated or failed centuries ago. 
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4 
Tactics: There is no way to get these traps work-
ing again and short of a DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check, it is unlikely the PCs will ever 
know what the Room was used for.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: N/A
W3 . EMPTY ROOM THREE 
The walls and ceiling of this Room are featureless, 
but hundreds of metallic chain links lie scattered 
upon the ground. Enormous anchors and segment-
ed plates jut from the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The prisoner held within this Room died 
centuries ago. All that is left are the chains that held 
him, corroded by his evil.
SKILLS
Here are a list of proficiencies that 
we generally believe you’ll need to 
survive this dungeon.
Athletics, Stealth, Arcana, Religion, 
Nature, Perception, Thieves’ Tools.
The following will be very helpful:
Language (Celestial), Language 
(Undercommon), Language (Dra-
conic), Language (Goblin), Animal 
Handling, Insight.
Because nobody’s heard of the 
World’s Largest Dungeon until now, 
bardic lore isn’t going to help much. 
“No, I don’t know any songs about 
demon princes banished to the Abyss 
for slaying every living fire elf. I’ve never 
even heard of fire elves. Can I just sing 
my song now, please?”

Encounter Condition: Negative Energy
Tactics: The chains radiate faint evil now, and the 
Room is too oppressive to remain in for long. 
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
W4 . EMPTY ROOM FOUR 
Scores of motionless gears, cogs, chains, and 
various metallic bits fill this chamber, leaving 
barely enough room for a human to squeeze 
through it. Silver-inscribed etchings in each mech-
anism crackle with a feeble electrical charge, but 
the room conveys a sense of frustrated power and 
intricate design.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The Room once maintained several 
magical fields, but the mechanism failed centuries 
ago, and the energy dispersed. All that is left is a 
resonating magical aura that makes creatures ner-
vous and edgy.
Encounter Condition: Fear 15
Tactics: PCs entering this Room are automatically 
Frightened; should they fail to move towards an exit 
at the earliest opportunity, they must succeed on a 
DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one level of 
exhaustion.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
W5 . EMPTY ROOM FIVE 
Thick cobwebs obscure vision beyond a few inches, 
but a harsh buzz echoes from the interior of the 
room. Tiny spiders scatter before your light and 
disappear into the webs’ depths. The stench of 
rotting meat wafts through the cloistered air of 
the chamber.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The only thing within the Room is the 
rotting corpse of a demon killed centuries ago. Its 
body constantly regenerates damage at the same 
rate that it decays, maintaining a perverse stasis. 
The body is home to thousands of flies, beetles, and 
other vermin.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, 
Stagnant Air
Tactics: While too few insects nest in the corpse to 
create a swarm, the GM is free to have a few rats 
and insects cohabitate as something pest-like any-
way. A vermin swarm made of bugs and rats could 
be a unique encounter here.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
W6 . EMPTY ROOM SIX 
The stench of death pervades this chamber. The 
air is thick, and a fine layer of dust covers the 
stone floor. A painting depicting a large woman in 
an elaborate pink robe hangs in the center of the 
north wall. Beneath it is a large wooden coffin. 
Its lid has been smashed open, and its wood has 
rotted. A closer look reveals the skeletal remains 
of a humanoid inside, interred with his clothes 
and sword.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The remains are those of an orc 
male who died ages ago. While it is not obvi-
ous what he died from, he was buried with his

SPELLBOOKS
Wizards do not have it easy in this dungeon. No, that’s not strong enough. Wizards get hosed 
by this Dungeon. Because the PCs are going to be underground for about two game years, 
with no way of returning to the surface, it’s difficult for wizards to justify spells appearing in 
their spellbooks without reason.
Sorcerers, druids, and clerics all draw their power from a less tangible source, but a wizard 
has no new sources of magic. Because this may upset those wanting to play spellcasters, there 
are a number of ways to help wizards through this.
There are plenty of scrolls scattered throughout every Region (and plenty of room for the 
GM to drop them into the Dungeon as you see fit). When these scrolls are discovered, the wiz-
ard can merely place the spells in his spell book rather than use them in combat. This ensures 
that wizards always have something but wholly determines what they can and cannot learn.
Alternatively, the GM can allow wizards to start with a full spellbook (as a 20th-level wizard), 
forcing the fledgling wizard to choose all his spells ahead of time. This is challenging, but 
can also put a wizard who is unprepared for specific challenges at a huge disadvantage. GMs 
should choose half of the spells for a spell book of this nature.
If a wizard gains access to a divine (or bardic) spell that also appears on the arcane spell list, 
the GM may allow the wizard to learn that spell. If the wizard studies the spell from a divine 
spell caster, add +5 to the DC check to learn it. Increase the modifier by +2 per spell level 
difference between the lists. If the wizard wants to learn a spell that’s 3rd level for a cleric but 
2nd level for a wizard, increase the DC by +7. No matter what, the wizard can learn only those 
spells that appear on his spell list.
Finally, the GM can simply allow the PC to choose whichever spells he likes as he goes up in 
level. This is the least exciting method, but gives PCs the greatest spread of options.
Ultimately, whatever the GM decides is law.
One last thing: there are certain spells (grease, entangle, web, etc.) that are one-note and a 
little powerful for an all-dungeon campaign. They will get repetitive and exploitative. It is our 
recommendation that GMs do not include them. GMs should do the same with the PCs.
belongings, suggesting he was important. But why 
bury him here?
Encounter Condition: Desecration 2 
Tactics: Depending on the orc culture of the GM’s 
game world, the orc could have been buried alive, 
burned and then buried, had his brain stored in a 
jar nearby, or any of a hundred other burial rituals. 
The details are left wide open.
Treasure: The painting portrays an unknown woman. 
Though not of particularly high quality, it is ancient 
and thus worth over 100 gp to the right person. 
The clothing is rotted and useless, but the sword 
is of good quality. It requires a good cleaning and 
sharpening. It is possible the orc was buried with a 
few other items, including (and up to) one common 
magic item (not a potion) or trinket.
Scaling: N/A
W7 . EMPTY ROOM SEVEN
This room is devoid of decoration, but its doors are 
framed by heavy stone structures sculpted with runes 
in intriguing patterns. These intricate frames are 
beautifully crafted but otherwise ordinary in design. 
The runes are decorative and not in any immediately 
known language. 
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: An angel sculptor fashioned the beau-
tiful doorframes of this Room, which housed 
archon builders when the vast dungeon complex 
was created.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Consider making the runes an ancient 
form of a language one of the PCs speaks. It is 

23
hard to translate word for word, but the sug-
gestion is that the angel sculptor left behind a 
love, but not a paramour. Not everything in the 
dungeon needs to be bleak.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A 
W8 . EMPTY ROOM EIGHT 
A large stone desk dominates this otherwise empty 
room. An elaborate candelabrum of tarnished 
silver sits on the grey desk. Its three candles dimly 
illuminate bas-reliefs on the walls, representing 
the grotesque faces of demons, gargoyles, and 
other terrifying creatures. The carvings are so well 
done that they appear real under the half-light 
of the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bas-reliefs in this Room were fash-
ioned by the celestial builders of the Dungeon, 
adding to the otherwise dismal surroundings. They 
represent some of the most fearsome creatures 
originally imprisoned within the vast complex, as 
seen by an angelic artist.
Encounter Condition: Positive Energy, Safe
Tactics: The place is safe to rest in for about 4 hours 
before the PCs find the irresistible urge to move on. 
Angels are not lazy (idle hands and all that) and only 
made this Room for short respites. 
Treasure: The candelabrum has three stems and 
is worth a mere 5 sp if cleaned. The candles are 
enchanted with light, however, and can be used 
as though they were three scrolls of light (one for 
each candle) by any character, regardless of spell-
casting ability. They remain lit permanently while in 
this room.
Scaling: N/A 
W9 . EMPTY ROOM NINE 
The blackened remains of a great tapestry hang in 
the doorway. Beyond the ruined tapestry is a dais 
bearing a large throne. Both the dais and throne 
are made from dark gray stone - the same material 
as the walls of this foreboding place. The walls 
are darkened by soot, and the faint smell of burnt 
wood lingers in the air.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This Room once served as a meeting hall 
for the angel wardens. Under the leadership of their 
commanders, the angels discussed ways of improv-
ing the security of the Dungeon. Demons destroyed 
the place centuries ago. 
Encounter Condition: Unhallowed 
Tactics: There is an uneasiness to the Room now. 
Once a holy place, the foul taint of demons can be 
felt by just standing there.

W10 . EMPTY ROOM TEN 
Though the walls of this shockingly clean empty 
room are not exactly mirrored, they glimmer with 
dim reflections. The floor seems as spotless as the 
walls and doesn’t appear to have accumulated any 
dust at all.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: There is a very large, round, invisible table 
in the center of the Room, bolted to the floor. In fact, 
physical inspection of the walls or floor proves the 
Room isn’t quite as clean and spotless as it appears. 
Any creature or object that remains in this Room 
for more than an hour turns invisible. The effect is 
continuous and cannot be dispelled so long as the 
creature or object remains inside the Room. 
Encounter Condition: Invisibility
Tactics: PCs walking cavalierly through the Room are 
liable to bang into the table. A Small creature will hit 
its head and chest, while a Medium creature strikes 
its thighs and waist into the table. This is annoying, 
but the table doesn’t damage the PCs. 
As soon as the PCs leave the Room, the effect 
ends, and they can be seen again. PCs of low Wis-
dom believe they remain invisible for 1d4 minutes 
per point of Wisdom below 10. In essence, the In-
visibility is a trick on the mind of the person being 
affected, not the person viewing them.
Treasure: The table cannot fit through the doors, even 
if it is unbolted from the floor. It is made of sturdy 
hardwood and is not magical. Nothing else lies in 
this Room except for invisible dust and dirt.

W11 . EMPTY ROOM ELEVEN 
The pale brown walls, ceiling, and floor are covered 
with some sort of leathery canvas, though no 
means of attachment can be seen. The air is stag-
nant, and the odor of sweat is heavy in this room. 
A small, dark, irregular circle seems to be painted 
on the floor. 
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: At one time, this Room was trapped with 
an incredibly complex and powerful spell, a last line 
of defense against a particularly nasty inhabitant 
of this Region. The only remnant of the trap is the 
Room itself, made up of the body of the creature 
that triggered the trap. 
The dark paint on the floor is actually a blood stain 
where the floor was once cut.
Encounter Condition: Fear 12
Tactics: Once the PCs realize the walls were made 
from the flesh of a living creature, a fear effect 
is produced. Failing a DC 12 Constitution saving 
throw causes them to become nauseated for 3 (1d6) 
minutes. Nauseated creatures have disadvantage on 
physical ability checks and all attack rolls.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
W12 . EMPTY ROOM TWELVE 
Opposite the massive stone door of this hall is a 
10 foot statue of black stone. The effigy represents 
a humanoid male, thick arms crossed across its 
massive chest. Though out of place, the statue 
is surprisingly clean and in good condition. Its 
pupilless eyes seem to stare eerily at you.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Angel wardens, now dead, sculpted this 
statue of a great celestial. It has remained un-
touched to this day. 
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 5
Tactics: Due to its powerful magical aura, monsters 
avoid this Room. As such, Random Encounters 
occur half as often here. 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: N/A
W13 . EMPTY ROOM THIRTEEN
A small grove of trees surrounds the stone floor of 
this Room, standing amidst snow-covered benches 
and a stone bowl full of ice. The normal floor gives 
way to a beautiful wintry landscape. As you look up 
to see the top of a giant fir tree in the corner, the 
stone ceiling blocks your view.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The scenic winter wonderland is real, cre-
ated by an artist of unsurpassed talent, with several 

25
sets of marvelous pigments. The trees, though not 
alive, are real. The snow and ice are real. Anyone 
can walk among the trees and kick up some snow. 
There are no magical illusions in this Room, but the 
walls are painted in such a way as to trick the view-
er’s eye. Visually, the Room appears to extend for 
miles when, in actuality, it fills an area 10 feet larger 
to a side than the Room’s original space.
Encounter Condition: Safe 
Tactics: If the PCs stand in the center of the Room, 
the optical illusion is perfect. If the GM feels so in-
clined, creatures from the Region could be resting 
here, but none are inclined to conflict because the 
Room radiates a constant Calm Emotions effect 
that can only be overcome with a DC 22 Charisma 
saving throw.
Treasure: Though PCs may find this Room a trea-
sure beyond words, there is nothing of physical 
value here.
Scaling: N/A 
W14 . EMPTY ROOM FOURTEEN 
This empty Room is best used if the PCs need to get 
across to another door. Otherwise, it will just frus-
trate them.
A dense fog fills this room, obscuring sight and 
muffling sounds. Footsteps can be heard walking 
away from the door through the fog, but beyond 
that, you find yourself completely isolated from the 
world around you. 
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: All sound in this Room is magically damp-
ened past 10 feet. This means that PCs venturing 
more than 10 feet away from each other lose contact 
completely until they stumble upon each other again 
in the fog. The footsteps start and stop every few 
seconds and eventually lead PCs to a door out of the 
Room (possibly the one they came through). Players 
that request to do so may have their PCs attempt a DC 
17 Intelligence (Arcana) or Spellcasting ability check to 
realize the sound of the footsteps is illusory. 
Encounter Condition: Fog 5, Haunted
Tactics: Feel free to have the footsteps move in 
random directions. This effect works best in a large 
Room with at least two doors.
Do not use miniatures or maps for this encounter.
Treasure: Feel free to drop a common magic item 
(or two potions) somewhere in the Room. On each 
PCs turn roll 1d20: on a roll of 19 or higher they are 
within 10 feet and a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) 
check will find it.
Scaling: N/A 
W15 . EMPTY ROOM FIFTEEN
The interior of this room reeks of rotting flesh, and 
flies buzz loudly. In the center of the room, a pile 
of charred wood is surrounded by six humanoid 
corpses. Another corpse lies on its side, partially 
leaning against the wall opposite the door. All of 
the bodies are in similar states of decay and have 
been stripped.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The corpses are of six goblins that got 
lost in the Dungeon and finally settled down here 
to rest before taking up their wandering again. 
Unfortunately for the goblins, the guard on watch 
fell asleep, and the whole group was murdered in 
their sleep.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: It is not clear who killed them and if the kill-
ers were the ones to loot the bodies.
Treasure: If the PCs search the bodies, a DC 16 
Wisdom (Perception) check turns up a gold neck-
lace worth 100 gp around the ankle of one of 
the goblins.
Scaling: N/A
W16 . EMPTY ROOM SIXTEEN
The door to this Room is locked, requiring a DC 15 
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to unlock. In 
addition, the lock is trapped. Choose a trap from 
Appendix A.
At the center of this room, a badly decomposed 
winged body lies. Its arms, legs, and wings cast 
out to the four winds; the body has obviously been 
the target of violence since its death. Shreds of fine 
raiment cover the body, but all weapons, armor, 
and goods have been removed. Next to the body, 
writing has been scratched in the stone.
Initial Attitude: N/A

 26
Encounter: This was one of the members of the ce-
lestial garrison who was slain after the first earth-
quake. Before he died, he carved his last words on 
the stone floor. In Celestial, they read, “Alsar of 
the Bright Host. I stood fast against the darkness 
and now travel into the light. Let you who find 
my body carry on the fight in my stead.” Alsar was 
slain, and his corpse was desecrated by creatures of 
the Dungeon.
Encounter Condition: Positive Energy
Tactics: Perhaps the Room’s contents have been 
shrouded by illusion, or the PCs were destined to 
find it, but this discovery points out that the Dun-
geon was once something much different than 
they thought. If this is their first encounter with the 
celestials or this information has never been im-
parted to the PC, they now have some record of the 
Dungeon’s past.
Treasure: Touching the body of the celestial turns it 
to dust but grants that PC +1 Con and +1 Wis until 
their next Long Rest. In addition, the PC is granted 
a vision of some important event in the history of 
the Dungeon . Make it vague but provide a hint 
that the Dungeon was more than it is now (as the 
spell divination). The celestial also bore a signet ring 
on his left hand. This signet could prove useful in 
Region C, E, or G, where identification as a “celes-
tial-aligned” being is useful.
Scaling: N/A
W17 . EMPTY ROOM SEVENTEEN 
The floor of this room is missing. Instead, there is 
a pit of significant depth, at the bottom of which 
is nothing but spikes and corpses. The walls and 
ceiling are bare except for a few scratch marks. 
A foul odor indicates that the bodies have been 
rotting for some time. 
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room contains a pit trap that is now 
stuck in the open position, nothing more than a 
very deep pit with spikes at the bottom. Some of 
the local residents use the pit for garbage disposal, 
particularly for the bodies of their enemies. With a 
DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, the trap 
can be repaired and the floor restored to the Room.
 '
Hidden Pit. Mechanical trap. This pit has a cover 
constructed from material identical to the floor 
around it. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check discerns the uncanny appearance of the 
section of ground that forms the pit’s cover while a 
successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of 
floor is actually the cover of a pit. When a creature 
steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, 
causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The 
pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deep-
er. Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or 
similar object can be wedged between the pit’s 
cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to 
prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it 
safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held 
shut using the arcane lock spell or similar magic.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: Because residents frequently bring trash 
here, roll for a Random Encounter after 30 minutes. 
Treasure: If the PCs climb down into the pit and 
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, they find 
13 sp, a rusted shortsword, and 2 (1d3) mundane 
trinkets of the GM’s choice. If they succeed on a DC 
19 Wisdom (Perception) check, they additionally find 
a large yellow diamond worth 500 gp.

W18 . EMPTY ROOM EIGHTEEN
Before the PCs open the door, read the following:
This door is abnormally warm. Heat emanates 
from the room beyond, and you can hear the sound 
of fire and an odd “whooshing” noise after short 
but irregular intervals.
Once the PCs open the door, read the following: 
This entire Room is scorched black. After a few 
seconds, the Room is entirely engulfed in flame, 
creating a ‘whoosh’ noise as air rushes in to feed 
the fire. This process repeats frequently, rarely 
taking longer than half a minute between bursts.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room contains a fireball trap, but 
the trigger has malfunctioned, and now the fireball 
goes off at random intervals (every 5 (2d4) rounds), 
destroying anything placed inside. The vent for the 
fireball trap is set in the ceiling, and the lever to 
turn it off is on the far wall. If the PCs wish to cross 
the Room, they must find a way to disable the trap 
without getting cooked.
The PC disabling the trap must brave the fire 
to reach the lever. Once they reach the lever, they 
must move as quickly as possible to disarm the trap. 
While a DC 16 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools 
disables the trap, this takes 5 (1d6+2) rounds. Every 
two points by which the PC’s roll exceeds 16 reduces 
the time needed to disable the trap by 1 round.
 '
Fake Fireball Trap. Magic trap. A spell or other effect 
that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect 
magic, reveals an aura of Illusion magic around the 
Room. PCs hit by the flames take no damage but 
must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or 
become Frightened for one round.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The fire is an illusion. A powerful illusion, but 
an illusion. The PCs should believe on every level 
that it is real until proven otherwise.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
make the fireball trap real. To decrease the chal-
lenge, add some element to the Room that makes 
the trap appear more “fake.”
 '
Real Fireball Trap. Magic trap. A spell or other effect 
that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect 
magic, reveals an aura of Evocation magic around 
the Room. PCs hit by the flames must succeed on 
a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) 
fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a 
successful one.
W19 . EMPTY ROOM NINETEEN
The door to this Room has broken off its hinges.
The door to this room has long ago been splintered, 
and only a few scraps of wood hang from the 
hinges. The walls are dominated by large wooden 
bookcases lined with scraps of paper, broken 
bindings, and other remnants of an impressive 
library. The bookcases have not fared much better. 
The entire room is ready to collapse.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Once one of the libraries used by the 
celestial garrison, this Room has been exposed to 
the damp air and several species of insects for the 
last few centuries. Now, its contents are all but de-
stroyed. Any human contact destroys the surviving 
books in this Room, but there are few of those to be 
found. Most of the books in this Room have long 
ago rotted away.
Encounter Condition: Fog 15 
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: If the PCs succeed at a DC 16 Wisdom 
(Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check or 
a DC 18 Intelligence (Religion) check, they find a 
divine spell scroll (glyph of warding) that has sur-
vived the ages.
Scaling: N/A
W20 . EMPTY ROOM TWENTY
While no heat radiates off the walls of this Room, 
the walls are constantly bathed in fire. A ring of red 
and blue flame coats the walls and floors, turning 
the stone black.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The wall of fire is an illusion. It produc-
es no heat and cannot harm the PCs. However, 

 28
if they believe it is real, it deals 18 (2d6+11) fire 
damage, just like a real wall of fire. If the PCs see 
past the illusion (DC 18 Wisdom saving throw), 
they see the walls are clean, and the fire hasn’t 
touched anything.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions 
Tactics: If the PCs move around the Room, there is a 
10% chance each round that they step on a pres-
sure plate which turns the effect off. It is unclear 
what the designers of the Dungeon intended with 
this Room.
7 (2d6) rounds after the fire goes off, the walls 
are showered with sheets of ice and cold. This effect 
is also an illusion, but PCs believing the Room was 
ringed with fire now believe it is ringed with ice.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the door close when the PCs enter and make 
the inside of the door look like stone, so finding a 
way out is more difficult. To decrease the challenge, 
reduce the damage of the illusory fire to 7 (2d6).

If you still need to read the introduction, do so now. 
You must understand the foundation of the dungeon

so on all explain how to run this adventure.
LONGTAIL
Longtail is a wererat sorcerer with a quick mind, cha-
risma, and grand ambitions. With research and the 
aid of his imp familiar Achsyyx, Longtail uncovered 
some of the secrets of the dungeons, its history, and 
their original purpose.
Through Achsyyx’s ability to commune with the 
infernal powers, he learned that there was a long-for-
gotten chapel close to the dungeon entrance that 
held a gateway to an extradimensional space where 
multitudes of infernal beasts had been trapped. 
According to Achsyyx, releasing those beasts would 
make the wererat their master and grant him a fero-
cious army. Longtail’s destiny was clear.
Longtail’s endless charm allowed him to bring 
together a diverse force of humanoids to accompany 
him on his quest. Gathered from the disaffected 
elements of half a dozen tribes; kobolds, troglodytes, 
orcs, and even an ogre rallied to his side.
Fueled by the promise of treasure and led by liz-
ardfolk guides, Longtail’s forces made their way to 
the dungeon in short order. Entering the long-lost 
entrance, they began exploring the area searching 
for the tomb’s fabled wealth. Longtail himself, guid-
ed by Achsyyx, led a small expedition into the far-
thest reaches.
At first, empty-handed, the humanoids were 
eager to exploit their new home, greeting Long-
tail’s absence as a chance to gather as much trea-
sure as possible. But as party after party came back 

29
empty-handed and with tales of barren rooms filled 
with nothing but traps, trouble ensued.
Longtail’s natural leadership had held the unusu-
al force together. Soon, however, natural rivalries 
began to assert themselves. Insults and slights led to 
shouting and infighting, and suspicions and rumors 
of unshared loot led to bitter accusations. 
Inevitably, an armed confrontation took place, and 
Longtail’s force was splintered in two. The reptilians, 
composed of the kobolds, troglodytes, and lizardfolk, 
banded together against the more numerous orcs 
and their ogre enforcer.
The dungeon was divided, each side looking for 
treasure they would never find. After fruitless days, 
both sides became convinced that the other side had 
found something. Soon, spying gave way to battle as 
the two factions fought across the length and breadth 
of the area. In a short time, they forgot about trea-
sure, concerned only with wiping out their enemies.
Whatever magic once existed in the prison-dun-
geon to keep hostilities squashed had evaporated. 
The dungeon was now fomenting with dissent and 
hate. Something Achsyyx either didn’t understand 
or didn’t plan for. And now, Longtail’s quest was a 
side note in the scuffle; some even forgot about the 
half-fiend.
They would soon be reminded.
Even as the humanoids fought amongst them-
selves, Longtail led his expedition to the forgotten 
chapel. There, with the aid of his familiar Achsyyx, he 
opened the gateway. 
Things did not go as planned. A wave of extraplanar 
beasts, driven by hatred, rushed through the gate-
way and into the dungeon. Falling on the fighting 
humanoids, the beasts struck a hammer blow that 
filled the dungeon with the blood and the screams of 
Longtail’s erstwhile allies. As Longtail tried desper-
ately to gain control, Achsyyx and the infernal pow-
ers smiled.
Random Encounters
The release of the extraplanar beasts has thrown this 
entire Region into chaos. Whereas before, there were 
clear areas under the influence of a particular group 
of humanoids, the resulting chaos means that there 
are no longer any actual areas of control. Between the 
hunting beasts and the scared, lost humanoids, there 
is plenty of motion and confusion in this dungeon. As 
a result, a party traveling through this Region is just 
as likely to encounter a reptilian as they are an orc or 
an extraplanar beast.
Rather than checking at some specific time interval 
for random encounters, the GM should use this table 
whenever they deem appropriate. Remember that 
despite the number of Rooms in this Region, there is 
not a lot of distance between most Rooms and areas 
and sound carries well in such an environment. If the 
action is slow — for instance, the PCs are taking their 
time searching through the rubble in a Room or are 
being extra cautious as they move down a hall — the 
events from this table will liven things up.
Another way to use the chart is to add a random 
element to the encounters described in the various 
Rooms. Many of the listed random encounters add 
an interesting twist to the otherwise standard com-
bat scenarios inevitable in a dungeon of this size. 
After all, the noise of combat is bound to attract 
some interest.
A final option for this table is if the PCs return to 
areas or Rooms where they have already been. Since 
the dungeon is in constant flux, it is likely that some-
thing other than the original inhabitants now occupy 
the Room. A particularly bold GM could use this 
table to add the occasional encounter to an otherwise 
empty Room.
Additional suggestions. Roll a random encounter:
 
Whenever the PCs spend too much time in one 
place
 
Whenever the PCs do something noisy 
 
Whenever the PCs rest with any sort of food or 
fire in a non-safe room

A1 . ENTRANCE 
This is the last chance the PCs have to rest and reflect 
before entering the dungeon. Nothing else enters it 
as long as the PCs are in the entrance chamber. An 
inspection of the passageway as it approaches the 
‘barrier’ reveals that it is absolutely featureless, devoid 
of markings, symbols, or even any sign of use.
As you move through the passageway, the edge of 
the tunnel disappears into a blackness that lies just 
beyond. It is not a wall barring entry but an inde-
scribable void. Darkness and light meet in a perfect 
duality. Peering cautiously into the darkness for 
signs of movement, you see none. There is a still-
ness in the air. No breeze in front of you. Nothing. 
Your ears detect only the breathing of your fellow 

31
adventurers. The darkness betrays nothing of what 
lies beyond.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The passageway ends in an opaque 
magical field. This field prevents all vision, includ-
ing darkvision, as well as all sound from passing 
through from one side to the other in either direc-
tion. In addition, the magical field has an unusual 
and permanent force effect that allows creatures 
and items to enter the dungeon without difficulty 
but absolutely prevents them from leaving.
Opaque Door Barrier: Permanent, one-way wall of 
force. Cannot be dispelled or disintegrated, and no 
sound can pass through it.
If the PCs want to enter the dungeon, they 
simply must take that leap of faith and step beyond 
the door. Cautious PCs may stick only a hand or an 
object through, but they find that when they try to 
withdraw the hand or object, they cannot because 
the barrier prevents the return movement. No 
amount of pulling brings the hand or object back 
through the barrier, although if enough force is 
used, the object could undoubtedly be broken or 
the hand severed.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: Subtly encourage the PCs to prepare them-
selves by healing, resting, and readying equipment 
and weapons, etc., prior to having them enter the 
dungeon if they need it. Nothing bothers them as 
long as they are in this Room, and they can take all 
the time they need to make sure they are in tip-
top shape. 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
do not indicate a barrier has been passed. Simply 
let the PCs walk through an invisible force field 
unknowingly. To decrease the challenge of this 
encounter, give the PCs a hint that this barrier is 
one-way, or simply ignore this effect completely. 
Allow the PCs to come and go as they please. This 
eliminates a lot of the dread of the dungeon but 
does give back one more gaming option to players 
who demand complete agency.
A2-A20 . ORC STRONGHOLD
Rooms A2 through A20 make up the former orc 
stronghold within this Region. The orcs chose the 
area closest to the entrance for defensive reasons and 
launched all of their search expeditions from here. 
While this portion of the dungeon is defensively 
strong, these same qualities limit the ability of the 
orcs to explore the other parts of the dungeon.
As the conflict with the reptilians escalated, the 
orcs’ leader, a barbarian named Orghar, decided that 
it was time to force a decision. Marshaling the orcs, 
he led them in an all-or-nothing assault on the reptil-
ians throughout the dungeon.
Since launching the attack, the orcs have aban-
doned this section. Although they planned to return 
and establish a garrison to guard the entrance once 
they were victorious, none returned. Various groups 
established themselves throughout the Region but 
have been displaced since.
A2 . THE FIRST ROOM 
Your torchlight gleams feebly in the complete 
gloom, lighting up a small section of the room. 
Barely glinting in the torchlight, two iron doors, 
one straight ahead of you and the other to the side, 
are the only things visible in the walls of worked 
stone. The chill and damp clings to your body. 
You are not the only one feeling it, judging by the 
coughs coming from the darkness.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly 
Encounter: Three orc warriors sit huddled together 
in the northeastern corner of this Room. They are 
battered remnants of the orcs who followed Longtail 
into the dungeon. There could be others. Somewhere. 
They look exhausted, and their scar-marked faces are 
ashen and pale. Infected wounds are evident, as well 
as bruises and blood stains from weeks of fighting. 
One has an eye full of pus. Another is missing teeth 

 32
and spits blood into a rusted cup. One orc attempts to 
stifle a lingering, persistent cough.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The orcs are fatigued from their recent expe-
riences. Each orc suffers from one level of exhaus-
tion. They are not looking for a fight and will only 
attack if the PCs attack them first. The PCs are free 
to move about the Room — the orcs only watch 
listlessly. Even if elves or dwarves are with the party, 
the orcs do no more than half-heartedly bare their 
teeth in an empty threat.
Any PC succeeding at a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) 
check realizes the orcs have simply given up and 
are waiting for the inevitable. If the PCs ask the orcs 
about what happened to them, the largest of the 
three appears to ponder the question for a moment 
and then says “You will see soon enough” in broken 
Common. The other two laugh at the response, 
the smallest one stifling his cough. The orcs ignore 
any further questions, answering with half-hearted, 
surly glances.
Any acts of intimidation, bluffing, or diploma-
cy fail on these tired warriors, and no amount of 
promises, threats, or bribes gets them to care about 
anyone or anything. No matter what, the orcs do 
not accompany or aid the PCs in any way. They 
make their final stand in this Room.
If a fight ensues, the orcs do what they can to 
defend themselves, but their fatigue and defeatist 
attitude work against them at this point. They em-
ploy no tactics other than a straightforward attack.
If the PCs return to this Room later (at least an 
hour or so has passed), the three orcs are dead, killed 
by fiendish darkmantles.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two more orcs. To decrease the challenge, have 
the orcs be exhausted (move at half speed, –6 pen-
alty to Strength and Dexterity).
A3 . BODY STORAGE 
Even before the door opens, you smell something 
amiss. As it swings open, the stench from within 
is overwhelming. The source is more than a score 
of bodies in a pile, their flesh rotting away. Some 
chunks hang on hooks, while a barrel filled with 
harvested organs stews in the center of the room. 
On the northern wall, a makeshift shelf, warped by 
too much blood and sagging from the weight of 
severed arms and legs, is about to collapse.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These bodies are trophies brought back 
by the orcs from their conflicts with the reptili-
ans. There are 23 bodies here, 17 kobolds, and six 
troglodytes in varying states of decay. All of them 
have been stripped of anything they carried in life. 
Examination of the bodies shows their wounds were 
caused by sharp-edged weapons.
If the PCs move around the room, they most 
certainly kick over a jar of preserved eyes that lies in 
the darkness. However it is possible to spot it with a 
Wisdom check (DC 16) before that happens. Whoev-
er left this has a sick sense of trophy-hunting.
The smell of decay is strong enough to require a 
DC 12 Constitution saving throw from every living 
creature that enters the Room. Failing the save 
causes the creature to be poisoned for the duration 
of their stay in the Room as well as for 1d4 rounds 
thereafter. Any living creature spending more than 
a single round in the Room is also subject to catch-
ing an airborne variant of filth fever.
Filth Fever: DC 11 Constitution save. On a failure: 
in 1d3 days, Dexterity and Constitution are each 
reduced by 1d4 until the disease is removed. Repeat 
save every 8 hours. Filth Fever ends after three con-
secutive successful DC 11 Constitution saves.
The secret door in the eastern wall is a standard 
secret door (Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15) that 
pivots on a vertical center hinge. The space opened 
by the door is just wide enough for a creature of 
medium size or smaller to pass on either side of the 
door (so up to two medium-size creatures can pass 
through simultaneously).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A kobold liver is mashed and cut up at the 
bottom of the barrel. Inside the liver, someone has 
stored a silver ring. The ring is somehow clean, and 
blood will not cling to it. It’s very large and won’t fit 
a normal-sized human finger, however.
Scaling: N/A

A4 . ANTECHAMBER 
The southern door to this Room is trapped with burn-
ing hands. Anytime a Tiny or larger creature touches 
the face of the door, the trap is triggered, shooting 
flames in a 15-ft. cone from the center of the door. 
 '
Burning Hands Trap. 3d6 fire damage. Creatures 
take half damage on a successful DC 10 Dexterity 
saving throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to 
find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. 
Automatically resets after 1 round.
The secret doors in the eastern and western walls are 
standard secret doors. 
Several piles of moldy sacks sit in each of the four 
corners of this room, and their decaying contents 
fill the air with a sour smell. There is a door directly 
across from the one you just opened.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The orc warriors in Room A2 are aware of 
the trap but avoid it. If the trap injures or kills any 
of the PCs while the orcs are in that Room, the orcs 
break out into grins and chuckle amongst them-
selves, claiming ignorance if confronted.
Inside one of the sacks is a troglodyte head, now 
covered in mold and devoid of flesh. The eyes have 
since rotted away or been eaten by bugs. If the PCs 
have not encountered a troglodyte before, the skull 
is a foreign shape to them. Conversely, allow a DC 15 
Wisdom (Nature) check to identify it.
The contents of the other sacks have long since 
rotted. They defy identification. Small gray mush-
rooms and black molds grow on top of the piles. See 
treasure below.
Any PC that disturbs a sack roughly causes the 
mold to burst, releasing its mildly poisonous spores. 
Picking up any sack breaks the bottom, spilling the 
contents on the floor. This also releases spores (obvi-
ously). Eating the mold produces similar results.
 '
Black Mold. If disturbed, a patch of this mold 
bursts forth with a cloud of poisonous spores. 
All living creatures within 10 ft. of the mold must 
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save or suffer 1d4 
points of Constitution damage for 24 hours. The 
only ways to destroy the mold is with fire or to let it 
dry out in a warm, dry climate for 24 hours.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: Since the PCs have survived a trap, they 
most certainly have to pass back through again, 
roll up a random magic item relevant to their level 
and class composition, and hide it amongst the 
moldy sacks.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the burning hands trap to 
6d6 and replace the black mold with yellow mold 
(see Room A84). To decrease the challenge, reduce 
the initial/secondary damage of the black mold to 1 
point of temporary Constitution damage each.
A5 . MAIN STORAGE 
The doors to Rooms A4 and A6 are open.
Rotting barrels, moldy crates, and disintegrating 
sacks with mushrooms embedded in them line the 
left wall of this room, leaving a 5-ft. wide passage-
way along the right wall directly in front of the 
door. The smell of mold and mildew is strong. Black 
mold spiderwebs out from the barrels and up the 
walls. Bloody starfish-shaped marks on the wall 
seem fresh, as though something was just killed 
here. But that isn’t possible. Right?
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Dozens of barrels, crates, and sacks line 
the wall, extending into the western end of the Room. 
They are piled up in a disorganized fashion (to say 
the least), and most of them have been opened (the 
barrels have their tops staved in, the crates’ boards 
torn away, and the sacks ripped open, some of their 
contents spilling onto the ground). 
As in Room A4, the sacks are covered in black mold 
and mushroom colonies. Although the barrels and 
crates are not so afflicted, the items are stacked so 
haphazardly that anyone moving a barrel or crate 
must succeed at a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check 
or release a cloud of spores from one of the sacks 
nearby. Moving a sack causes it to disintegrate, spill-
ing its contents on the floor and releasing the mold 
into the air. 
If the PCs are bold enough to rifle through the 
contents anyway, they find that the barrels contain 
vinegar (still good), the crates contain various rusted 

 34
mining tools (such as picks and shovels), and the con-
tents of the sacks have been lost to the mold.
 '
Black Mold. If disturbed, a patch of this mold 
bursts forth with a cloud of poisonous spores. 
All living creatures within 10 ft. of the mold must 
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save or suffer 1d4 
points of Constitution damage for 24 hours. The 
only ways to destroy the mold is with fire or to let it 
dry out in a warm, dry climate for 24 hours.
The acid arrow trap in the hallway beyond Room A5 
is described in Room A6.
The blood on the wall is from a fiendish darkmantle 
that consumed a fleeing orc. The body is long gone, 
but the blood refuses to dry up. Something about the 
kill remains fresh, though neither the killer nor the 
victim is still here. The PCs can collect this blood into 
a bottle or flask. The blood never congeals or dimin-
ishes in quality. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: A careful search of the Room (DC 15 Wis-
dom (Perception) check) reveals a small gold ring 
(40 gp) and a simple chain (20 sp) resting between 
two barrels. Note that as long as the search does 
not entail actually moving anything, there is no 
chance of releasing the black mold.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of the encounter, 
replace the black mold with yellow mold (see Room 
A84). To decrease the challenge of the encounter, 
reduce the Constitution damage to 1 point or lower 
the save DC to 10.
A6 . TOOL STORAGE 
Coils of rope, barrels with nails, and open crates 
with tools line the walls on makeshift pegs. Al-
though the air is damp, there is no mold on any of 
the items.
Any Tiny or larger creature entering the north/south 
hallway leading to Room A6 triggers an acid arrow 
trap. The proximity trigger covers the space just be-
fore the northern door to Room A6. Any creature who 
remains for more than one minute in the hall resets 
the trap, allowing it to trigger again. 
 '
Acid Arrow Trap. A shimmering green arrow streaks 
towards the target. +4 to hit one target. On a hit, 
4d4 acid damage immediately and another 2d4 at 
the end of the target’s next turn. DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check to find, DC 15 Intelligence (Ar-
cana) check to disarm. Resets after 1 minutes.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: There are five coils of hempen rope to-
taling 500 ft., as well as seven small barrels of rusty 
nails and enough tools to make a total of 10 sets 
of stonemason’s tools (hammers, chisels, etc.). The 
hemp rope has been weakened by the damp air and 
breaks if subjected to holding more than 100 lbs 
of weight.
The secret door in the western wall is a standard 
secret door and is used to bypass the trap in the 
hall. The PCs can open it with a little bit of pressure 
(DC 10 Strength check) once the door is discovered.
Because of the acid arrow trap, this room is not 
safe to rest in. But should the PCs find a way to 
disable it, they can stay here for a while without 
disturbance. Regardless, there is no chance of a 
random encounter here.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There is a 1 in 20 chance one of the tools 
is magical in nature, providing a +2 bonus to skill 
checks while using it.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a 3rd stage of damage to the acid arrow trap for 
another 2d4 acid damage. To decrease the chal-
lenge, reduce the Wisdom check DC by 5.
A7 . FORMER TROGLODYTE 
QUARTERS 
The heavy smell of stale air greets you as you open 
the door to this large room. Dried grass is scattered 
all over the floor as though a tornado recently tore 
through a meadow. Something written in blood 
in a foreign language stands about 3 feet off the 
ground in the northeast corner.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was occupied by a small group 
of troglodytes who treated it much like their former 
cave home; they were among the first of the orcs’ 

35
victims when relations among the humanoids went 
sour. Given their uncivilized nature, they used it not 
only as their sleeping place but for everything else, 
although they kept those activities to the southeast-
ern corner.
The troglodyte stench is eye-wateringly power-
ful, and any living creature that enters the Room 
must succeed at a DC 12 Constitution save or be-
come poisoned for as long as it is in the Room and 
for 1d4 rounds after it leaves the Room. 
The dried grass is composed of reed mat rem-
nants the troglodytes used as sleeping mats, and 
were destroyed during a fight in this Room. A DC 
12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals dried pools of 
blood throughout. 
The troglodytes were unaware of the secret door 
in the middle of the northern wall, as were the 
orcs. The locking mechanism for the door is quite 
simple, but the door is hard to spot. It can only be 
found with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) 
or Intelligence (Investigation) check. Finding and 
pushing the latch does not require a roll once the 
door is found, however.
Troglodytes, who died fighting the orcs, were 
disposed of through various means, including leav-
ing them for the rats to finish off, and using their 
bones as weapons.
The bloody letters are written in draconic. 
“Gristuun was here” is written in an extremely 
crude form.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: Brave characters may search through the 
detritus. On a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) check, they uncover one of the following: 
a necklace made of freshwater shells of various 
sizes on a leather thong (1 gp); a ceremonial bronze 
dagger (5 gp); or a ceramic idol of a creature that is 
a cross between a toad and a lizard (no value).
Scaling: N/A 
A8 . ORC CORPSE 
The floor is covered in debris, and the walls are 
covered with decades of filth. The body of an orc, 
his arm outstretched toward the doorway, lies 
slumped near the middle of the room. The smell of 
decay is oddly absent, and the body has not started 
to rot. A lone spear, its shaft broken, lays in one of 
the corners. Giant holes in the body of the orc, but 
no blood, indicate a strange murder.
The door to Room A2 is closed. The door to Room 
A9 is open.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This orc was a clansman to the orcs in 
Room A2, who they abandoned. Attacked by fiend-
ish darkmantles or stirges, he managed to drag 
himself here in a vain attempt to keep up with his 
clansmen. If the PCs alert the three orcs in Room 
A2 that they have found another orc, none of the 
trio responds.
A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check of the body reveals several holes in the 
corpse’s neck, arm, and leg where the fiendish crea-
tures successfully attached themselves to the orc. 
Each hole also has up to eight smaller, rough punc-
tures near it where the pincers found purchase.
If the PCs move the body, a weird series of 
cracks and hollow noises escape the joints and 
bones. The orc’s sandals are tattered, and the bot-
tom of his feet are covered in sores and lesions.
Upon closer inspection, the orc wears a thin 
bracelet of elven origin. If it is removed, the PCs’ 
nostrils are assaulted by the smell of death. The 
bracelet’s magic keeps the body from rotting, and 
the process happens almost instantaneously as the 
body transforms in seconds. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Unless the PCs are exceptionally quiet and 
do not use a light source of any kind, the fiendish 
darkmantle in Room A9 is alerted to their presence 
through the open doorway.
By this point, the region should start to feel un-
easy. For low-level characters, the problems staring 
them in the face are not typical. The orcs don’t real-
ly want to fight, and the dead that are found show 
signs of a problem atypical to low-level adventures. 
If you’re looking to prepare them for the rest of 
the campaign, ratchet up the creep factor as they 
explore deeper into the prison.
Treasure: A heavy burlap satchel attached to the 
corpse contains a few silver pieces, a pair of teeth 
(origin unknown), a piece of flint that is wrapped in 

 36
wet cloth, a jeweler’s hammer, 11 feet of rope, two 
iron spikes, and a bone saw.
The orc’s bracelet smells of ocean air and clean 
sand. Whatever magic created it, it still works on a 
new body should a PC wear it. But it only halts and 
does not reverse the rotting process.
Scaling: N/A
A9 . DEATH FROM ABOVE 
Both doors in this Room are open. The southern door 
has been wedged open with a sturdy piece of metal.
An open door on the opposite wall appears to 
be the only other way in or out of this otherwise 
empty room. The floor is suspiciously clean, except 
for a permanent burn mark on the eastern wall.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Clinging to the ceiling of this Room is a 
fiendish darkmantle. The darkmantle is hanging by 
its “foot” in the middle of the ceiling. It has lifted its 
tentacles up and flattened itself out, taking on the 
coloration of the stone as it waits for potential prey 
to move underneath it. A PC succeeding on a DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices an unusual 
lump on the ceiling.
Once the darkmantle drops, the noise of com-
bat attracts a nearby fiendish rat (out scouting for 
its fiendish rat swarm) from Room A10. Given the 
darkness and commotion in Room A9, the fiendish 
rat’s presence goes completely unnoticed unless a 
PC states they are specifically looking for additional 
danger, at which time a successful DC 17 Wisdom 
(Perception) check reveals the fiendish rodent.
As long as it is unobserved, the fiendish rat 
watches the combat to the end and then leaves to 
report the activity to its fellows in Room A11. If it 
is spotted, the fiendish rat immediately flees the 
scene to make its report. 
Tactics: This fiendish darkmantle has patiently waited 
for someone to enter the Room since killing the orc 
in Room A8. It attacks the moment a PC has fully 
entered the Room.
The fiendish darkmantle most likely gains sur-
prise and uses this round to invoke its darkness be-
fore attacking on the next round. This is a common 
darkmantle tactic.
It attacks the first PC into the room, seeking to 
incapacitate them before moving on to the next 
nearest, dealing with each PC in turn. Unless the 
PC has spotted the fiendish darkmantle, he still will 
not know exactly what is happening or where an 
attack might be coming from.
This fiendish darkmantle fights to the death, 
even pursuing fleeing PCs.
Note: It is quite possible for PCs to die in this en-
counter. Consider letting the PCs take on the roles of 
nearby orcs, or if they are reduced to less than 0 hit 
points, make their first death save automatic.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Echoes 
5, Fearless
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the fiendish darkmantle hide directly above 
the doorway, increasing the Perception check DC 
to 21. Consider having a second fiendish rat appear 
and attack the PCs while engaged. To decrease 
the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish 
darkmantle fly into the Room as the PCs enter. Both 
sides are surprised.
A10 . THE WATCHER IN THE 
DOORWAY
Both doors to this Room are open. The following 
description omits the presence of the fiendish rat. 
Peering through the open doorway, you discern for 
certain that the room is empty. There is an open 
door that seems to be the only exit.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The fiendish dire rat most likely ran to 
join the fight in Room A9. Unless the party defeated 
the fiendish darkmantle in Room A9 without mak-
ing noise, the fiendish dire rat fought there and is 
not here. If the fiendish dire rat is caught unaware, 
it flees quickly, avoiding combat at all costs.
Wary PCs succeeding at a DC 14 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check while in the Room hear the sound 
of hundreds of tiny nails scratching on stone as the 
fiendish rat swarm approaches.
One round after the PCs enter this Room, the 
fiendish rat swarm, alerted by its scout, enters from 
the open north door and attacks. The swarm hisses, 

37
leaving a trail of saliva, slime, and urine in its wake. 
Patches of discolored hair contrast the overwhelm-
ing black fur of the swarm. It is unclear if this is a 
mutation or a sign of disease.
Those who fail their Wisdom (Perception) check 
are surprised.
Tactics: The fiendish rat swarm washes into the 
Room like its namesake, attempting to cover as 
many PCs as possible within its 10-ft. square. Its 
members fight to the death, pursuing fleeing PCs.
PCs may use a door to block the progress of the 
fiendish rat swarm. Although the wave is capable 
of opening unattended doors, its collective mem-
bers are too weak to open a door held closed by a 
PC. Faced with such an obstacle, the wave batters 
against it for 5 rounds and then looks for a way 
around the obstacle or seeks out more acces-
sible prey.
If possible, they attack good characters first. 
Each round, the swarm damages a PC, roll on the 
following chart.

shapes or produce fear effects. Have their torches 
dim, etc. The rats are intelligent and might com-
ment on the taste of the character’s blood or how 
killing them now is a kindness compared to what 
awaits further into the dungeon. Some foreshad-
owing of potential threats awaiting the PCs is a 
good way of both increasing tension and playing 
fair as a GM.
This is only the tenth encounter. Keep the PCs 
guessing. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add a second 
fiendish rat swarm. To decrease the challenge, 
the swarm arrives in 1d4 rounds and does not 
gain surprise.
A11 . BONES IN THE HALL
Both doors into this hallway are open. 
A single small (nonhuman) skeleton lies in this 10-
ft. wide hallway. Bits of clothing and leather armor 
cling to its frame. The skeleton shudders a bit but 
falls still. It wants to stand but can’t. The head 
turns to face the PCs but then falls off its neck. 
One hand twitches on the skeleton’s belt.
Two open doors, one on either end of the hallway, 
give no clue as to what lies beyond.
Initial Attitude: Varies
Encounter: The skeleton is the remains of a kobold 
captive brought back by an orc patrol and killed by 
Orghar. He was left here as a warning before being 
picked clean by the fiendish rat swarm.
If the PCs have not encountered a kobold before, 
they do not know what the skeleton is. Conversely, 
allow a DC 15 Wisdom (Nature) check to identify it.
Carefully examining the skeleton shows hun-
dreds of tiny bite marks on the bones and leather 
armor. Looking through the open doorway to the 
north reveals four more open doors (Rooms A12 
through A15). The skeleton tries to stand and ani-
mate, but the magic is weak, and it just twitches.
It mutters the same phrase over and over again 
in draconic. “The trees are beautiful in Autumn. 
The Introduction presents a number of ways 
to get a party started in the World’s Largest 
Dungeon. A more specific example is suggest-
ed here, detailing the ambitions of Longtail and 
the imp Achsyyx. Although the exact reasons 
for the PCs’ travel to the dungeon are up to the 
GM, Longtail’s plans feed directly into the plot 
of this region.
If you include this canon, Longtail has stolen 
a book of rituals from a nearby church.
In its simplest form, this means the PCs 
could be retained by said church to stop Long-
tail’s plans. This is also a handy way to ensure 
that the PCs are adequately equipped before 
entering the dungeon, with the third party pro-
viding essential aid, such as perhaps an ongo-
ing source of magical lighting or two.
An alternative idea is the PCs have had a 
run-in with Longtail or his humanoid allies 
before entering the World’s Largest Dungeon. 
This would require the GM to author up his 
pre-pre-adventure. Nothing complicated. Just a 
short series of investigations that keep Longtail 
always one step ahead.
Regardless, once the PCs arrive at the dun-
geon, they find themselves in the middle of 
the action. 
The PCs don’t need to be aware of any plots 
to enter the dungeon, either. If they are trea-
sure-seekers searching for a long-lost magic 
item, this might be enough motivation to enter. 
In this case, the PCs just happen to be unfortu-
nate enough to enter the dungeon shortly after 
the release of the extraplanar beasts.
PLOT HOOKS

39
Serve the Lady of Eggs. It’s a bitter harvest. Longtail 
lies. The bat lies. Save the eggs.”
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the skeleton come to life when the PCs 
are near. It is not full health and probably won’t be 
much of a match for the PCs, but it should warn 
them of things to come (much later).
A12 . ORC QUARTERS
The door to this Room is open.
Peering through the open door, you find out this 
room is a disaster area. Unpleasant hints of animal 
waste fill the air, and scraps of clothing, bits of 
wood, and other trash cover the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This was one of the Rooms the orcs 
used as sleeping quarters. The few items of fur-
niture there, along with the former occupants’ 
clothing, backpacks, and other possessions, have 
been chewed to pieces by the fiendish rat swarm 
(Room A10).
The smell is rodent waste with a hint of sulfur. 
It stings the nose, along with the overpowering 
scent of urine.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 12 Investigation check 
allows a PC to visually pick a few salvageable items 
amid the debris: a rusted, normal dagger, a dented 
tin drinking cup, three silver coins from a forgot-
ten age, a 5-ft. length of chain, and a bent key that 
could go to almost anything. A DC 16 Strength 
check straightens the key. Rolling too high, howev-
er, breaks the key.
Scaling: N/A
A13 . GNAWERS
The door to this room is open. 
Unpleasant odors linger. This one greets you 
before you step through the open door. The smell, 
combined with the trash-covered floor, makes it 
clear that the rodents’ path of destruction came 
through here.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Two fiendish dire rats, following the 
fiendish rat swarm, busily sift through the trash, 
hoping that the wave missed something. So far, 
they have had little success. One of them has an 
extra set of crooked fangs hanging from its mouth. 
The other has extra, frail limbs dragging behind 
its body. The limbs are useless but unnerving 
to look at.
More intelligent than their Prime Material coun-
terparts, these fiendish dire rats work as a team. 
One sifts through the rubbish while the other keeps 
watch. Unless the PCs are moving without a light 
source of any kind, they have no chance to surprise 
these infernal rodents (DC 22 stealth check).
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Fearless
Tactics: The fiendish dire rats are difficult to surprise 
given their scent ability; they can detect the pres-
ence of a PC within 30 ft. (although they must be 
within 5 ft. of a PC to detect his exact location). The 
fiendish dire rat on watch squeaks a warning to his 
companion as soon as he spots light or hears the 
movement of the PCs. Both fiendish dire rats hide 
in the rubbish that fills the room, requiring a suc-
cessful DC 16 Perception check to be noticed.
This duo is smart enough to avoid a fight 
against an obviously much stronger foe. They attack 
a lone PC or even two, rushing out from ambush to 
gain surprise or flank (if possible).
If more than two PCs enter the Room at the 
same time, the fiendish dire rats remain hidden, 
bursting from hiding only when spotted or if a PC 
gets too close and fleeing out of the Room toward 
the northeastern portion of the dungeon.
If the fiendish dire rats attack, they fight until 
reduced to one-half of their hit points or until out-
numbered, at which point they flee. If flight is not 
possible, they fight to the death. The fiendish dire 

 40
rats pursue fleeing PCs, attacking the rearmost PC 
and allowing the others to escape.
Treasure: A successful DC 12 Investigation check al-
lows a PC to visually pick one salvageable item amid 
the debris: old and dented manacles that might 
fit a child.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, give the dire rats a fear ability and/or disease. 
Consider adding one more dire rat. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, add a third fiendish 
dire rat but have them all fight over a scrap of food 
when the PCs enter the Room, giving the PCs a 
round of surprise.
A14 . ORC QUARTERS
The door to this Room is open. 
Trash lays in the hallway. The smashed door indi-
cates something was already here. Instincts tell you 
the room has been ransacked. Once inside, you see 
the remnants of a bed in one corner of this room, 
but everything else has been thoroughly destroyed.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This was the Room of two orc barbarians 
and actually contained a bed that one of the pair 
had scavenged from Room A20. Unfortunately, the 
fiendish rat swarm has torn the place to bits. The 
bed is nothing more than a plank on four legs.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: With a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check, the PCs notice a small tin box lying un-
der the bed. The box is six inches long, three inches 
wide, and two inches high. It has a clasp that is held 
closed by a piece of metal wedged into the ring. 
On the lid is a lion crest from a nearby kingdom, 
indicating a human was once here, though it’s un-
clear how long ago. The crest’s motto is “Those who 
serve the lion, serve themselves.” GMs are welcome 
to alter this to fit their own campaign worlds.
The box is not trapped or otherwise locked. 
Inside, the box is lined with black silk and has three 
indentations to hold vials. Although there are two 
vials in the box, one of them is broken, and its 
contents have settled into the silk. There is current-
ly only one intact vial in the box: a greater potion 
of helaing.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
lock the box. To decrease the challenge, add another 
vial and indentation.
A15 . CORNERED FIENDISH DARK-
MANTLES
The door to this room is open.
The bitter smell of rodent dung and decay is 
overwhelming. Trash is strewn across the floor, 
ankle-high in most places. The occasional blood-
stain marks the floor and walls, accompanied by 
a black and purple inky residue. A severed hand is 
evident on a small pile of trash, and an exposed 
arm bone has been gnawed on. A trio of dead rats 
are nothing more than entrails and bones. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This is a former orc sleeping area; the 
fiendish rat swarm cleaned out what remained from 
dozens of previous raids.
Clinging to the ceiling of this Room are two 
fiendish darkmantles. Realizing they had become 
prey to a nearby swarm, the pair retreated here to 
await the rodents’ passing. They wait for the danger 
to pass, clinging to the center of the room. Splotchy 
purple birthmarks on one of the darkmantles make 
it easier for it to hide.
Note: The pair keeps a close watch on the door by 
constantly emitting high-frequency sounds, making 
it almost impossible to surprise them.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Darkness
Tactics: The fiendish darkmantles work as a team in 
their pursuit of prey. Once they are aware that it is 
a group of humanoids — and assuming the odds 
aren’t overwhelmingly against them — one dark-
mantle moves to position itself directly above the 
door, while the other moves into the far corner to 
be harder to spot (DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) for 
the one above the door, DC 20 for the one in the far 
corner). If the PC states that he is specifically look-
ing at the ceiling, grant an advantage to the roll.
The fiendish darkmantles surprise the first PC 
through the door, with the one in the far corner us-
ing its surprise round to invoke its darkness ability 
while the one above the door attacks the PC. Even 

41
if the PC spots the fiendish darkmantle on the far 
wall, the one above the door may still have surprise.
If the duo cannot achieve surprise, the one on 
the far wall invokes its darkness ability while the 
other attacks. In all cases, the darkmantles keep the 
combat near the doorway to prevent numerous PCs 
from flanking them while, in turn, gaining flanking 
positions on the PC near the doorway.
If either fiendish darkmantle is reduced to less 
than one-half their hit points (or is killed), they 
flee using their darkness ability to help cover their 
escape. The fiendish darkmantles pursue fleeing 
PCs, concentrating on the rearmost and letting the 
others go.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add a third darkmantle inside the room and/
or another fiendish darkmantle that attacks a PC 
in the hall, thus limiting movement. To decrease 
the challenge, remove the darkmantle’s ability to 
surprise the PCs.
A16 . SOUTHERN  
HALLWAY ROOM
Both doors in this room are open. 
You can already see the exit of this room, an open 
door directly across from you. Like so many rooms 
before it, the interior is filled with trash. The smell 
is either improving, or you are growing used to it.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is empty, save some dust and 
detritus. The moment the PCs enter this room, roll 
Wisdom (Perception) checks every round for the 
fiendish stirges in Room A18 (fiendish stirges have a 
+0 to Wisdom (Perception) checks; roll as a group). 
If the PCs are spotted or heard, the fiendish stirges 
fly down to investigate.
PCs who are capable of seeing through the open 
doorways into Room A18 (using darkvision) may 
make DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) checks to see the 
fiendish stirges. All PCs with a passive Perception of 
12 or higher can hear the agitated little beasts.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions or 
Extreme Cold
Tactics: Once the nearby darkmantles and stirges are 
defeated, this is a safe room to rest in.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the fiendish stirges in Room A18 roll at ad-
vantage. To decrease the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the fiendish stirges in Room A18 roll at 
disadvantage.
A17 . MIDDLE HALLWAY ROOM
Both the doors in this room are open. 
This room looks much like the others, with bare 
walls and nothing else to look at. A strange wood-
en triptych has fallen from the wall and broken.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Like Room A16, this room is completely 
empty. Assuming that neither side has spotted the 
other, continue to make a single Wisdom (Perception) 
check each round for the six fiendish stirges in Room 
A18 as well as for the PCs (DC 12).
Encounter Condition: Drafty, Echoes 2
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Now worthless, the wood-etched triptych 
was probably valuable at one time. The carvings of 
animals and plants show serene iconography in this 
otherwise dank environment. 
Scaling: N/A

 42
A18 . NORTHERN  
HALLWAY ROOM
All three doors in this room are open. 
This room appears to be a junction, with three 
open doorways leading in different directions. Like 
the previous two rooms, it is empty. Something 
about it indicates the room was used for something 
else, a long time ago. Your intuition is screaming 
this place is more than just an underground vault. 
Perhaps a prison. Or a torture chamber. A place 
where things were collected and stored. The lack of 
any features seems almost alien and fiendish.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: As in Rooms A16 and A17, this Room is 
completely empty. It served as a junction Room 
and defense point for the orcs. Before that, it would 
have been a transfer point for prisoners. The doors 
and wall radiate the faintest abjuration magic to 
those who would detect it.
If they have not spotted the PCs previously, six 
fiendish stirges alternate flying and hopping about 
the room, obviously agitated. Deciding that this 
was an excellent spot to wait for potential prey, the 
six have taken up residence. However, given their 
alignment, the fiendish stirges do not trust one an-
other. As such, they continuously hop and fly from 
perch to perch to prevent one another from being 
the first to feed.
The stirges have been mutated and transformed by 
the fiendish magic that claimed them. Their hooked 
bills are split in two, segmenting their faces. Their 
eyes have grown into two vertical, but not symmet-
rical, sets on each side of their faces. Each fiendish 
stirge is slightly different from the next but with 
terrifying and bizarre visages.
Encounter Condition: Concealment
Tactics: When one of the fiendish stirges sees or 
hears something of interest, it goes to investigate, 
and the others follow. In the case of the PCs mov-
ing through A16 and A17 or either of the hallways, 
roll Wisdom (Perception) checks for the fiendish 
stirges as the PCs move. On a successful Wisdom 
(Perception) check (DC 13), one of the fiendish 
stirges has either seen the PCs or heard them and 
flies off to investigate. One round later, two more 
fiendish stirges follow the first, and on the third 
round, the remaining ones follow. The lead fiendish 
stirge attacks the first PC it comes across, and the 
others join in as soon as they arrive.
Each fiendish stirge fights as an individual and will 
not cooperate with another stirge. They prefer to 
seek out their own victims rather than share. As a 
result, each PC finds themselves fighting at least 
one stirge directly. In combat, the stirges use their 
ability to fly to dart in, drain a PC, and then evade 
retribution. They continually switch the PC they’re 
attacking, buzzing about and around the group like 
flies around red meat. 
An individual fiendish stirge will not pursue a flee-
ing PC as long as there is an open PC in the imme-
diate area.
Although aggressive, the fiendish stirges are also 
cowards. If damaged, each flees, abandoning the 
others to their fate. If two of the six are killed, the 
remaining flee.
A satiated fiendish stirge (one that has drained 4 
points of Constitution) will fly off down the hallway 
to the east to find a place to digest its meal.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have all six of the fiendish stirges arrive at the same 
time. To decrease the challenge of the encounter, 
have two of the fiendish stirges begin to fight each 
other rather than the PCs.
It is possible that this fight will be over quickly. 
Feel free to bring in more scavenger-type rein-
forcements—more dire rats, for instance. Have 
another stirge show up, but it has a series of weird 
powers and even more messed-up features. The 
list goes on.
A19 . REFUSE 
PCs approaching within 20 ft of this alcove become 
aware of the putrid smell. Read the following text 
when they reach the alcove. 
You have traced the smell to its source: a hole some 
eighteen inches in diameter cracks the stone floor in 
the corner. Two fat, deformed worms lie dead inside 
the hole. Each worm is about a foot in diameter 
and several feet long. One climbs up from the hole, 
the other locked around the head of the first. The 
first has a ruptured stomach and smells of offal. 

43
It appears that the first died from the inside out, 
splitting itself open from overeating. The second 
appears to have started to eat the first and choked 
to death, if that is possible? Rats have, regardless, 
avoided this easy feast.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The hole is actually a small crack that 
appeared during a minor earthquake. The hole 
has become a home for trash, refuse, and disease. 
Giant, unforeseen, discolored, and diseased worms 
have died inside the hole. Any contact with the 
stone, trash, or worms makes one susceptible to 
catching filth fever. 
Filth Fever. DC 11 Constitution save. On a failure: in 1d3 
days, Dexterity and Constitution are each reduced 
by 1d4 until the disease is removed. Repeat save ev-
ery 8 hours. Filth Fever ends after three consecutive 
successful DC 11 Constitution saves.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (filth fever), 
Stagnant Air
Tactics: Consider adding the sound of insects and 
vermin as the PCs approach. While there is a warn-
ing of what they are approaching, the creatures 
need not look like anything they’ve seen before. 
Mutate the bugs, if necessary. They feed on the 
worms slowly.
Scaling: N/A
A20 . ORGHAR'S QUARTERS
The door to this Room is open as is the secret door in 
the eastern wall. 
A table, a stool, and a bed, all intact, sit across 
from the door. In the center of the room, a circle 
of six stools surrounds a small mound of dirt on 
the floor. An otherworldly feeling of evil permeates 
the air. Just standing at the doorway, one can feel 
something bad happened here.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This was Orghar’s bedroom and head-
quarters. The Room is almost exactly as he left it 
when he went to lead the orcs in the final assault 
against the reptilians. But evil lingers here. Those 
sensitive to it cannot avoid it.
Orghar’s evil permeates everything here. And 
all because of a ring. A ring gifted by Achsyyx to 
Longtail made it into Orghar’s possession a little 
while ago. And that ring has driven Orghar to im-
possible levels of evil.
The ring serves one purpose: to amplify evil. 
Though it is long gone from here (now in Room 
A82), the evil remains. Anyone casting detect good 
and evil finds remnants around the room.
On the top of the table is a summoning circle, 
crudely drawn, perhaps as practice for a real circle 
somewhere else. A hollowed-out kobold skull sits 
on the table along with a backscratcher carved from 
a lizardfolk thigh bone. The bed, a plank with four 
legs, still holds Orghar’s blanket and a pillow made 
from troglodyte skin and stuffed with the hair of 
orcs his clan has defeated in combat. The six stools 
were where Orghar would hold his planning meet-
ings, while the dirt served as a crude chalkboard to 
illustrate his plans. In good military fashion, what-
ever had been drawn on the dirt is obscured.
The secret doors in the southern and eastern 
walls are opened with pressure plates in the floor. 
The plates are stones like any other but are tightly 
pressed against the wall, so finding them isn’t easy. 
Once the plate is pressed, a latch is released, and 
the secret door can open easily.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: Orghar hollowed out one of the legs of 
his bed; a search of the bed reveals this (DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check trick. Inside the 
leg, he stowed seven small pieces of jade (each 
worth 4d4 x 10 gp). Although he meant to retrieve 
the jade, Orghar forgot about the gems and has 
yet to be back for them. The jade pieces have been 
tainted with evil, like most of Orghar’s effects. The 
taint will dissipate eventually, but touching them is 
ill-advised.
Behind a few bits of wood, a leather pouch with 
a deck of playing cards featuring four new suits 
(sword, fireball, whip, and spider) and a gold ring 
with an opal inlay (worth 280 gp) are hidden.
Scaling: N/A 
A21 . THE SECRET ROOM 
The eastern door leading to Room A72 is trapped. 
Pulling the door open releases scything blades 

 44
located underneath it. The blades swing out at any-
one standing closest to the door (usually the person 
opening the door; each blade swings into the square 
directly in front of the door), dealing 2d8 damage. A 
hidden bolt near the outside edge of the door can be 
pushed down to keep the blades in place. The trap is 
reset when the door is closed. 
Spots of blood on the floor outside the door hint at 
a trap, but in the darkness the PCs may not notice it. 
Several rough tables are scattered throughout 
this room. Poorly constructed chairs are pushed 
under the tables. Everything is coated with a fine 
layer of dust.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room has not been occupied in quite 
some time, somehow being missed through all the 
years it stood empty.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: Despite the trapped door, this Room is an ex-
cellent place for the PCs to rest. The room tends to 
swallow up the light, halving the distance of torches 
and candles. Light-based magic works normally.
Treasure: A careful search (Intelligence (Investigation) 
check, DC 16) reveals a few minor personal effects 
that escaped notice over the year—a personal 
brooch, a snuff box, and a perfectly round pebble 
that inexplicably weighs two pounds.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add fire and/or radiant damage and a second set of 
blades that swings out from behind. To decrease the 
challenge, allow the PCs a DC 12 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check because of the blood.
A22-A24 . PILLAR ROOMS
Rooms A22 to A24 are part of the original construc-
tion of this dungeon. Although the dungeon’s cre-
ators did not require much comfort, they did create 
some places to pass the time. This is one of the areas 
and consists of these three Rooms, each with a differ-
ent function.
The humanoids all knew of these Rooms but only 
used Room A22 for its water supply. They never real-
ized the magical properties of Room A23 and avoided 
Room A24 due to the uncomfortable silence. Current-
ly, there is only one monster in these Rooms.
A22 . WATER PILLARS
The door to this Room is open. 
You hear the sound of trickling water as you ap-
proach. The sound comes from four pillars, one in 
each corner of the large room, with water channels 
cut into them.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly 
Encounter: The running water imposes disadvantage 
on all Wisdom (Perception) checks to hear made by 
any creatures either while in the Room and trying 
to listen to noise within or outside the Room, or for 
creatures outside of the Room trying to make out 
noises from inside the Room.
Before the PCs have a chance to refresh them-
selves, they must contend with the ogre that is 
currently catching a rest here.
This Room, along with Rooms A23 and A24, is 
actually part of the original construction of the 
dungeon. The water that runs down the pillars is 
the result of a permanent create or destroy water 
effect that resides in a hole in the top of each pillar. 
Water flows down a channel cut into the pillar, 
which is somewhat larger at its base than at its top, 
and ends up in a small 1-ft. diameter and 1-ft. deep 
pool at the base of the pillar. Thanks to the magic, 
the system is constantly in balance, and as long as 
no more than two gallons of water are taken in any 
round, no drop in the water flow or in the pool will 
be noticed.
If detect magic is used on the pillars, they radiate 
a strong (but old) transmutation aura. Destroying 
the pillars destroys the magic. Although the original 

45
inhabitants did not need the water for survival, it is 
perfectly drinkable.
Except for the pillars, this Room is otherwise 
empty. There were once meditation mats but 
they are long gone. Rotted pieces might still be 
around the room.
Encounter Condition: Drafty or Poor Footing 2
Tactics: Bragdor the ogre is not the brightest of 
fellows, but even he knows when he is overmatched 
and the beasts that are crawling all over the dun-
geon intimidate even him. Of course, he can deal 
with the humanoids, and the PCs are ideal for 
taking out his frustrations.
Bragdor’s face is covered with scars from fight-
ing darkmantles. Though the wounds aren’t new, 
they haven’t completely healed yet. His greatclub 
has rat teeth buried throughout its length, partially 
as ornamentation and partially for effect. The han-
dle is wrapped in darkmantle skin. Bragdor carries 
a very sharp camp knife. He uses it mostly for odd 
jobs, not fighting. But it’ll cut someone up pretty 
well in a pinch.
Even though he sits on the ground, resting 
his bulk against the northeastern pillar, Bragdor 
notices any light source moving down the hallway 
or coming from A23 readily enough, and once he 
spots it, he readies himself for some sport. Due to 
the noise of the water falling, he is unlikely to hear 
any creatures before they enter the Room unless 
they are making a lot of noise (the ogre suffers dis-
advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks made 
to listen). Depending on where the light is coming 
from, he attempts to hide his bulk behind a pillar 
(the northwestern pillar if the light comes from the 
hall or simply standing by the pillar he is resting 
against if the light is coming from Room A23).
If Bragdor manages to hide, he is actually 
difficult to Spot in the shadow of the pillar (DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check) until a light shines 
on him, at which point he is easily seen. Whether 
he is hidden or not, the moment he spots some-
thing, he takes a defensive pose, gauging how the 
PCs will act.
If forced to fight, Bragdor does not hold back. 
Like most ogres, Bragdor is a bully. As long as he 
feels that he has the advantage over his opponents, 
he gladly bashes them away with his huge club. 
Consider giving Bragdor an advantage on his next 
roll after a round in which he deals 10 or more 
points of damage.
If the PCs gain Bragdor’s respect, either by 
reducing him to one-half or fewer of his hit points 
using physical attacks or by causing at least 15 
points of damage from spell attacks, the ogre 
changes his tactics. He backs away from his foes 
toward the most tactically favorable position, using 
full defense while calling out for parley.
It is up to the PCs whether they parley or not. 
If PCs attack, Bragdor fights his way to one of the 
doorways and defends himself there, fighting to 
the death if no other option is available; he only 
makes the parley offer once. If the PCs accept his 
parley offer by lowering their weapons or verbally 
agreeing to it, Bragdor looks around warily before 
lowering his club.
The PCs may, if they choose, talk with the ogre. 
With his newfound respect for the PCs, he is happy 
to engage in conversation and even apologizes 
for any PCs that were injured or killed. Bragdor is 
capable of relating the details of the journey to the 
dungeon, the name of the orc leader (Orghar), the 
history and state of relations between the orcs and 
the other humanoids, as well as the sudden appear-
ance of various strange beasts that attacked every-
one. The exact details of such a conversation are left 
to the GM. Given the ogre’s rather simple mind, 
he is incapable of giving specific details on such 
things as directions or anything beyond simple 
impressions of the beasts (caped bats, big rodents, 
stinging flies).
He knows that Orghar has become more evil 
and violent in recent months? Years? How long 
has it been, he wonders. But he doesn’t know the 
source of this evil. Bragdor remains extremely 
scared of Orghar; the orc’s concentrated malev-
olence left a deep impression. Whenever talking 
about Orghar, Bragdor checks over his shoulder 
to see if the orc is nearby. He tries to avoid saying 
the name out loud, worried it might summon him, 
and performs odd, superstitious little tricks with his 
fingers, warding off the orc’s evil eye. 
If explicitly asked about Longtail, Bragdor has 
trouble remembering who it was, and the PCs 
may have to jog his memory with a description. 
Even then, all he can share is that the “rat-man” 
has been gone for some time. Bragdor cannot 
make the connection between Longtail’s absence 

 46
and the appearance of the beasts in the dungeon 
on his own.
Once the PCs and Bragdor are done talking, 
they may wish to leave. He will not accompany 
them under any circumstances, stating that it 
would not be a good idea if he was seen with them 
because “Orghar might get mad.” 
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
Bragdor surprises the PCs, and no parley is allowed. 
To decrease the challenge of this encounter, reduce 
Bragdor’s hit points total — he was injured from a 
previous fight.
A23 . PILLARS OF ILLUSION 
The doors to this Room are open. 
This room is even larger than the previous one, 
though these four large pillars seem to be made of 
something other than stone. There is a soft hum, 
clearly coming from the corners.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The Room appears empty, and the pillars 
are completely non-descript. This is deceiving as 
the pillars are capable of generating major image 
effects. This is not evident, however, unless some-
one casts detect magic on them, at which point they 
radiate an elusive magical aura. What that means is 
the caster can tell there’s magic here, but it is un-
clear what kind and just how much. The magic itself 
is disguising its power.
Should the magic be uncovered with further 
study, the caster knows it is illusion magic. Creating 
an image requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check. If successful, the creature can create 
a major image that acts exactly as the spell, but only 
in the Room.
If Bragdor in Room A22 has been dealt with, this 
room is a safe place to rest.
Encounter Condition: Haunted
Tactics: Destroying the pillars destroys the magic.
This room was, at one time, an archive for the 
creatures who built this place. These pillars are 
magical repositories for memory. As such, the PCs 
can use them to piece together recent events in 
the region, assuming they can attune to the pillars. 
This requires a DC12 Intelligence (Arcana) check or 
a DC14 Wisdom check. Once attuned, the PCs can 
command the pillars to show their stored memo-
ries–scrolling forward and backward through them 
as they choose. PCs can generate illusions on their 
own. If the PCs spend at least 30 minutes in the 
room, the pillars begin to create soundless illusions 
revealing angels and demons inside the prison. 
Nothing specific beyond a demon being escorted 
by angels, for instance.
Another illusion shows the appearance of Long-
tail and Orghar and their contentious relationship, 
though it does not reveal their names. There’s the 
image of Orghar fighting reptilians and another il-
lusion of fiendish creatures coming through cracks 
in the “air.”
Gamemasters are welcome to give other sound-
less clues about Region A.

A24 . PILLARS OF SILENCE 
The door to this Room is open. 
Four pillars dominate the corners of this 
large room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Total quiet exists in this Room courtesy of 
the permenent silence radiated by the pillars. These 
effects are identical to the spell of the same name 
except that the effect is limited to this Room. No 
sound can be generated within the Room and no 
sound passes through the Room, so that sounds 
made out in the hall do not penetrate through 
Room A23 and vice-versa. Casting detect magic on 
the pillars reveals a faint illusion aura.
Encounter Condition: Safe 
Tactics: Destroying the pillars destroys the magic.

A25-A36 . THE MAZE 
The “Maze”, as the humanoids call it, is a mystery. 
Perhaps its maddening design kept prisoners from 
finding the surface. Whatever its purpose, the tight 
quarters, countless doors, and winding halls were a 
perfect reminder of home for this particular tribe of 
troglodytes. 
Orghar had enough tactical acumen to realize that 
dozens of orcs could get bogged down in the “Maze” 
and thus, except for a small force to take Room A25, 
the orcs avoided the area during their final assault 
on the reptilians; Orghar planned to deal with the 
troglodytes later. Although the orcs’ surprise attack 
managed to drive the troglodytes from Room A25, 
the orcs were themselves soon overrun and forced to 
retreat into the “Maze’’ by a large swarm of fiendish 
darkmantles that Longtail had released. Currently, the 
troglodytes hold the eastern Rooms in their grasp, 
having fought off the fiendish darkmantles in the 
narrow halls. They await whatever comes next. 
Due to the close quarters and the effects of the 
troglodyte musk, this is a dangerous area for even 
a well-prepared party, especially near Rooms A31 
through A34. Before having the PCs enter, thoroughly 
study this section of the dungeon. 
The doors in the maze portion, that is, the doors 
between hallways, are all open unless otherwise indi-
cated. Doors between hallways can open in either di-
rection; the decision is the GM’s. Note that any action 
that takes place within the hallways of the maze itself 
will be referenced in the description of the Room that 
is closest to the action.
A25 . PILLAR ROOM 
All doors to and from this Room are open. 
A giant pillar, some 10 feet in diameter and rising 
from floor to ceiling, dominates this room. Defaced 
images cover every inch of the column, leaving no 
clue as to what they might have once been. Several 
open doorways lead out of the room, but they 
were obviously of little use to the orc corpses that 
litter the floor. Several bodies of reddish, leathery, 
octopus-like creatures are scattered about, one still 
attached to an orc’s head.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: The images of the pillar are beyond 
recognition, horribly defaced. The seven orcs are 
remnants of Orghar’s strike force sent to take this 
Room, killed by the swarm of fiendish darkmantles 
that flooded through the area. They learned too 
late that the extraplanar beasts are quite capable of 
opening doors. Examining the orcs shows that all of 
them have lolling tongues and bulging eyes or bro-
ken necks. They were clearly attacked by the fiendish 
darkmantles. 
Currently, eight fiendish dire rats root through 
the remains for choice pieces.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions
Tactics: Having followed the fiendish darkmantles in 
the hopes of picking up scraps, these fiendish dire 
rats are busily gorging themselves and have disad-
vantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect 
the PCs’ approach.
The moment the PCs are detected, the fiendish 
dire rats take up a defensive posture, arched backs, 
hackles up, and hissing, but they do not attack 
unless provoked. They are not interested in the 
PCs and would rather have the easy meal that is 
already provided than fight with a new foe. As long 
as the PCs leave the fiendish dire rats alone, the 
rats reciprocate, going back to their meals and only 
occasionally hissing a warning in the PCs’ direction. 
The PCs should recognize the signs of an animal 
defending its territory, but if not, allow them a DC 
12 Intelligence (Nature) check or DC 14 Wisdom 
(Survival) check to understand the situation. 
The PCs can move about the Room as long 
as they avoid the fiendish dire rats. If a PC gets 
within 10 feet, a fiendish dire rat gives a warning 
snap of its teeth. If a PC gets within 5 feet, the dire 
rat attacks. 
If it comes down to combat, the fiendish dire 
rats defend their territory, fighting as best they 
can. Individual fiendish dire rats retreat or flee 
if reduced to one-half hit points (or fewer). The 
remaining fiendish dire rats retreat if three or more 
of their number are killed. These rats do not pursue 
fleeing PCs, being more than happy to feast on the 
dead orcs.

Treasure: In addition to the arms and armor (rusty 
scimitars, old hand axes, a cleaver, a punch dagger, 
a pair of sharp stilettos, a small shield, and a suit 
of oversized studded leather armor), PCs can find a 
few items of interest on the orcs with a successful 
DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check — a small 
block of hack silver (a chunk of silver from which 
pieces are cut to pay for items; worth 37 sp); a gold 
nose ring (6 gp) threaded through an orc’s nostril; 
a small leather bag with three pieces of lapis lazuli 
(12 gp each); a set of well-worn ivory knucklebones 
(3 gp); a silver and gold bracelet with images of 
dolphins (75 gp); a small, bright golden feather 
woven into one orc’s hair (actually a Quaal’s Feather 
Token (whip)). 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the fiendish dire rats fight to the death. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, the PCs 
surprise the fiendish dire rats.
A26 . THE NARROW ROOM 
The door to this Room is open. 
Two naked orc corpses lie in the back of this long 
and narrow room, obviously the victims of the oc-
topus-like creatures. The room is otherwise empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: These orcs were forced to retreat to this 
Room when the fiendish darkmantles attacked and 
were killed for their efforts. They bled out slowly 
from their wounds. Their weapons and armor were 
stripped away by troglodytes, except for one crude, 
unbalanced greataxe that was too heavy to carry 
away. The troglodytes, finally able to effectively 
repay the orcs, hacked up the corpses in a show of 
petty vengeance.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs are here for more than 10 minutes, 
roll a random encounter. Under no condition is this 
Room a safe place to rest.
Treasure: One of the orcs has a crude treasure map 
tattooed onto his back. It does not look like any 
place the PCs recognize, but the GM is encouraged 
to have it lead somewhere if the PCs ever escape 
this dungeon.
Scaling: N/A 
A27 . STORAGE ROOM 
The door to this Room is open. 
Several shovels and picks lay against one corner 
of the wall. A corpse, an orc by the look of it, lays 
in the other corner, a flying octopus attached 
to his head.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Although the PCs may at first assume 
that the fiendish darkmantle is feeding on the orc, 
this is not the case. A successful DC 10 Wisdom 
(Perception) check or simply walking up to the 
corpse reveals a dagger stuck in the beast’s head. 
Out of desperation, the orc stabbed at the fiendish 
darkmantle with his dagger, killing the beast and 
himself. The orc still wears his scale armor, a battle 
ax at his side.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the characters attempt to remove the fiend-
ish darkmantle, or the dagger, from the orc’s head, 
the orc lurches to his feet. The prolonged effects of 
fiendish contamination bring him back from the 
dead as a ghoul of some sort. He attacks immedi-
ately. The orc-ghoul uses the ghoul stat block but 
starts with half the standard hit points and can-
not use the claw’s action. The transformation was 
interrupted by the PCs. Should the orc-ghoul kill 
or eat a PC or another creature, it is immediately 
restored to full health and gains the ability to use 
the claws action.
If Turag is with the party, the ghoul attacks 
him first.
Treasure: Aside from the armor and battle ax, the orc-
ghoul has a pouch with seven bloodstones (30 gp 
each). Any PC that takes a moment to examine the 
dagger or succeeds at a DC 13 Intelligence (investi-
gation) check notices that it is of fine quality and is, 
in fact, a silver dagger.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the ghoul’s armor class, armor, attack bo-
nus, and damage by 2. To decrease the challenge of  
this encounter, the orc doesn’t reanimate, irrespec-
tive of the PCs’ actions.

49
A28 . THE WHIMPERER IN DARK-
NESS
An orc corpse lies in the hallway just before the door, 
another victim of the fiendish darkmantles. If the PCs 
attempt to open the door, read the following. 
Pushing against the door, you sense resistance.
If the PCs push harder, read the following.
When you push a little harder, the door moves 
slightly before moving back towards you as if 
there is resistance from the other side. Was that a 
whimper you heard?
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The door is being held closed by Turag, 
an orc that managed to survive the fiendish dark-
mantle swarm by seeking refuge in this Room even 
as his fellow orc was being killed right outside the 
door. He is barricading the door by jamming the 
point of a kobold spear under the bottom and hold-
ing on for dear life. 
The PCs can force open the door by succeeding 
at an opposed Strength check against Turag (Turag 
has advantage on the check due to his Strength and 
the leverage the spear provides). But Turag cannot 
hold out forever. He loses advantage after five rolls 
(should he succeed that long). Turag whimpers all 
the while the PCs try opening the door.
Once the door is forced open, Turag retreats 
to the northwestern corner, grasping his battleaxe 
and trying to look as threatening as possible, even 
though he is shaking with fear. A DC 8 Wisdom 
(Insight) check reveals that the orc is clearly in no 
condition/mood for conflict.
If the PCs attack Turag, he goes down fighting 
(see tactics). If, on the other hand, the PCs make 
any friendly overtures, the orc falls to his knees, 
drops his battleaxe, and begins pleading with the 
PCs to help him escape.
Although this exchange should be role-played, 
the GM can resolve this through a DC 14 Charisma 
(Persuasion) check, with advantage if none of the 
party are reptilians or extraplanar creatures. If Bo-
yikt (Room A69) and his kobolds are accompanying 
the PCs, the kobolds attack Turag. Even if the check 
fails, Turag does nothing more than continue to try 
and hold off the PCs by looking as threatening as is 
possible in his current state; he only attacks if he is 
attacked. 
If the PCs agree to help the orc, he is incredibly 
relieved and grateful, throwing himself at his rescu-
ers’ feet and in general being subservient. Although 
he is still an orc, Turag is clever enough to know 
that, at least at this moment, the PCs are his only 
way of making it out alive and will do what he can 
to help them; he plays up the role of the servant 
to the maximum. He’s obsequious, eager to help, 
and always offering strange bits of proverbial orcish 
wisdom such as:
 
A dead badger in your sack is better than a live 
one in your trousers
 
Might as well kill the bastard now than regret not 
killing them later
 
The best way to catch a goblin is firmly by the 
throat.
The PCs could gain an NPC retainer out of this. Con-
versely, if a character has recently died, someone 
can play Turag for a while.
Naturally, this is largely lip service, and Turag 
avoids doing any actual work (especially fighting) 
unless absolutely necessary to defend himself or if 
he is threatened with abandonment or bodily harm. 
What Turag does should the PCs encounter a group 
of his brethren or a powerful antagonist Turag 
might feel inclined to throw his lot in with is up 
to the GM. Having some reliable comic relief in a 
campaign is always a good idea. Turag’s experiences 
in the region might be a useful way of imparting 
information the PCs otherwise miss. Of course, 
having a beloved NPC suddenly turn traitor is a 
dramatically effective move too. Do whatever suits 
your campaign best. 
If the PCs will not help, Turag accepts the judg-
ment with a shrug and returns morosely to his cor-
ner. The orc does not say anything to, or respond to 
anything from, the PCs from that point on. How-
ever, once the PCs leave the Room, Turag stealthily 
follows them, dogging their steps just out of range 
of any light sources. He is determined to follow the 
only chance he has at salvation. Even if caught at 
this game, Turag does not give it up unless the PCs 
kill him. If confronted about his actions, he whines 
and pleads ad nauseum, making a series of increas-
ingly implausible claims about his various talents. 

 50
Turag can relate the general events of the orc 
entry into the dungeon and their battles against 
the reptilians. He has no idea where the beasts hail 
from; he only knows that his small band of warriors 
was suddenly attacked by a huge swarm of leathery, 
flying, octopus things. Once in this Room, Turag 
took safety (he won’t mention the part about barri-
cading it against his fellow orcs) and was somehow 
missed in the excitement.
Turag cannot tell the PCs much of anything 
about the dungeon itself. Being a simple warrior he 
did what he was told and did not bother with the 
details. The previous combats with the reptilians 
are a blur of Room-to-Room combat and he has no 
actual recollection of the routes. As a result, Turag 
can in no way serve as a guide to the PCs as he 
does not know anything, and “everything looks the 
same anyway.” That doesn’t mean he won’t claim to 
be able to guide them if he curries favor.
Asking the orc about Longtail receives little 
response. He only saw the “rat-man” once or twice 
and then only when he was talking with Orghar. 
He has not seen the “rat-man” in some time and 
has no idea what he might be up to. Turag does not 
make the connection between Longtail’s absence 
and the appearance of the beasts in the dungeon 
on his own.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Cover
Tactics: If the PCs attack Turag, he fights to the death 
as best he can in his shaken state (consider him to 
have 2 levels of exhaustion).
If he joins the PCs, Turag stays out of combat, 
letting the PCs do all the work. He defends himself 
if attacked, while crying for help. If threatened by 
the PCs, Turag actively engages in combat to save 
his own skin, and then only if a PC fights beside 
him; he will stop the moment he is able. At no time 
will Turag risk his life to save or help a PC unless he 
feels the PCs will kill him if he does not.
Turag is a covert coward, however. He tries to be 
near combat sufficiently to claim involvement but 
not so much he might actually become involved. 
Afterward, he regales anyone who’ll listen with all 
the ways he aided the party, not-so-subtly hinting 
their victory was really due to his assistance.

A29 . CASUALTIES 
The secret door to this Room has been wedged open 
with rusted equipment and orc bodies.
Close to a dozen orc bodies lie in various places 
about the room, along with an equal number of fly-
ing octopus creatures. Several chairs and tables are 
also present, no doubt scattered during the battle.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Close to a dozen orc bodies lie in various 
places about the room, along with an equal num-
ber of the flying octopus creatures. Several chairs 
and tables are also present, no doubt scattered 
during the battle: Once used as a marshaling hall, 
the Room is presently empty except for the bodies. 
However, once the PCs have been inside the Room 
for two rounds, a fiendish rat swarm enters the hall-
way leading to this Room from the southern door 
and heads for the Room in search of more prey. If 
the PCs spend less than two rounds in the Room 
or simply look inside and leave, the wave enters the 
hallway while the PCs are still in it.
Large, hungry, emboldened fire ants feed on the 
bodies. Consider making them into a swarm that 
fights the PCs if the PCs encroach on their meal.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The fiendish rat swarm has been tracking 
the PCs since picking up their scent in Room A25. 

51
Although primarily scavengers, this wave is actively 
hunting for live flesh. 
As the wave enters and rolls down the hall, allow 
the PCs DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) checks where 
appropriate in order to note its arrival. 
The fiendish rat swarm’s tactics are straight-
forward: it sweeps into Room A29 and covers the 
maximum number of PCs in its 10-ft. by 10-ft. area. 
The fiendish rat swarm fights to the death, pursu-
ing fleeing PCs and tracking them by scent if they 
get out of sight.
If the PCs spot the wave in time, they can push 
closed the door to Room A29, using their bodies to 
block the door and prevent the wave from entering. 
The wave batters unsuccessfully against the door 
for four or five rounds before all becomes still. If 
the PCs open the door at any time thereafter, the 
wave rushes through, having waited in silence for 
the PCs to do just that. 
Clever PCs might think to look under the door 
or might succeed at a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) 
check and notice the wave still waiting outside. 
In that case, the wave eventually moves off down 
the hallway to lurk in the shadows at the western 
end, waiting for the PCs to open the door and step 
out — at which point the swarm rushes down the 
hallway to attack. 
Treasure: Along with the usual orc arms and 
armor, a careful search of the orc bodies reveals 
a few spoils with a successful DC 12 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check — a battleaxe with the runes 
of the manufacturer engraved in the blade. This is a 
battle axe and is the work of the renowned dwarven 
weaponsmith, Dorin Steelforge; a hunk of amber 
(11 gp); a necklace of teeth of various kinds (no 
value); a length of red silk ribbon tied in an orc’s 
hair (dirty beyond cleansing and thus no value); 
three silver earrings in one orc’s ear (8 gp, 10 gp, 
and 17 gp respectively); a small ivory carving of a 
lion (25 gp); a punching dagger embedded in one of 
the fiendish darkmantles.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the secret door crushed to rubble so the 
PCs cannot easily block the entrance. To decrease 
the challenge, reduce the hit points of the fiend-
ish rat swarm to one-half prior to the start of the 
encounter and/or allow it to occupy only a 5-ft. by 
10-ft. area.
A30-A36 . SICK AND TIRED
The hallways and Rooms north of Room A30 and west 
of and A36 are the home of the troglodytes. PCs that 
enter the area are automatically considered poisoned 
the entire time they are within the area from the 
strong concentration of troglodyte musk that per-
vades the area. 
They must also succeed on a DC 11 Constitution 
save when within the hallways or Rooms A31, A35, 
and A36. On a failed save, the PC is nauseated (un-
able to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do 
anything else requiring attention; only a single move 
action per turn is possible) for 1 minute, after which 
time they continue to be poisoned for as long as they 
are in the area but can no longer be nauseated. Be-
cause of the massive concentration of musk, there is 
no need to roll for reactions to the musk of individual 
troglodytes while in this area.
As the PCs pass through this area, they notice a 
number of fiendish darkmantle corpses (roughly one 
every 10 ft.) the troglodytes killed as they retreated 
down the hall.
The only way to eliminate the sickening effect is to 
leave the area (either go south of Room A29 or east 
of Room A36), at which point the sickening effect 
remains for another 1d4 rounds.
There are a number of options for characters 
wishing to counter the smell. A rag dipped in vinegar 
(found in Rooms A5, A70, and A79), or alcohol, and 
worn as a mask negates the smell as it hits the PCs 
faces, thus eliminating the penalty. A magic-user with 
a spell like Gust of Wind can be used to dispel the 
noxious musk in a room, while more reckless PCs 
might try and burn it out.
The GM should be open to creative methods to try 
and overcome, or at least mitigate, the effects of the 
troglodyte musk.

 52
A30 . OPEN ROOM 
The door to this Room is open.
A near-naked troglodyte lies in the comer, stran-
gulation evident on its features. Next to him lies a 
flying octopus creature, its body torn apart.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The dead troglodyte was one of three on 
guard in this Room when the fiendish darkmantles 
struck. His partners managed to retreat to Room 
A31 and warn the troglodytes there while he fended 
them off. He was easy prey. The others assumed he 
died, but didn’t stick around to find out.
If the PCs turn over the body, they find an ornate 
tattoo covering the troglodyte’s back, from neck to 
ass. The tattoo is the symbol for war in the troglo-
dyte’s language. It is a symbol for protection as well 
and may have conferred magical defenses on him.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: A well-worn and crude spear lies next 
to the troglodyte. He possessed very little. Not 
even armor. 
Scaling: Consider having the tattoo leap from the 
troglodyte’s body to a brave warrior who examines 
the body. It permanently grafts to his body and 
confers a +1 AC bonus.
A31 . A NOT-SO-TASTY MEAL 
The doors to this Room are open. 
The bodies of two troglodytes lie on the floor, ob-
viously suffocated to death. Stirges suck whatever 
blood remains in their desiccated corpses.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: These troglodytes met their fate as the 
fiendish darkmantles swept through the area. The 
fiendish darkmantles are long gone, having pushed 
on to the western end of the “Maze.” Currently, 
eight fiendish stirges are taking advantage of the 
situation and draining the corpses dry.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises
Tactics: The fiendish stirges are busy feeding and are 
thus distracted (disadvantage on Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks). They do not notice any lantern/
torch light until it falls upon them. Although they 
are feeding, the fiendish stirges are not particularly 
thrilled with the quality of troglodyte blood and 
gladly welcome a chance to feast on something 
tastier, namely the PCs. 
Once the fiendish stirges spot the PCs, they take 
to the air to attack, spreading their numbers out as 
evenly as possible. Should the PCs gain surprise, 
they do not have time to mount a smart offensive 
and fight chaotically. 
The fiendish stirges, like the PCs, suffer from 
the troglodyte musk in the area and are consid-
ered poisoned.
Although the fiendish stirges are hungry they 
are not suicidal and any fiendish stirge reduced to 
one-half its hit points or fewer flies back to Room 
A30 and from there to the east, gladly leaving its 
fellows behind. If at any time the odds are even 
or there are more PCs than fiendish stirges, the 
remaining fiendish stirges flee.
Because the fiendish stirges have already been 
feeding on troglodyte corpses, they are not hungry 
and only drain 5 hit points each from the PCs. Once 
full, they fly off to digest their meals.
To complicate matters, one of the fiendish 
stirges is semi-translucent and is harder to hit. All 
stirges either sharing this stirge’s space or adjacent 
to it function like mirror images of the stirge. In 
addition, it is more connected to its fiendish energy 
and explodes with vile ichor and blood when killed, 
dealing 1d6 acid damage to all creatures within 5 ft.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the fiendish stirges be hungry enough to drain 
20 hit points from a victim. To decrease the chal-
lenge of this encounter, have each fiendish stirge 
only capable of draining 5 hit points from a victim.
A32 . TORTURE CHAMBER 
The door to Room A32 is trapped. Pulling the door 
open releases some inexplicable radiant energy 
located underneath it. The radiant energy expands 
from a holy sigil drawn on the floor just under the 
door. When the door is opened, the energy spreads, 
hurting everyone of evil intent.
The trap is reset when the door is closed. Nothing the 
PCs do can permanently disarm the trap.

53
 '
Radiant Energy Trap: Radiant light explodes out in a 60 
foot cone from the sigil, searing all those of non-good 
alignment. DC 15 Dexterity save to avoid. On a failed 
save, the creature takes 5d4 radiant damage and is 
blinded for 1 minute, or half damage on a success-
ful save and is not blinded.
Read the following once the PCs open the 
secret door.
This room belies the standard, featureless rooms 
of the Region. Something, or someone, has trans-
formed this large cell into a torture chamber. 
Several sets of wrist and ankle shackles are pinned 
into the stone walls. Dried pools of blood collect 
below each set, underlining the macabre nature of 
the room. Given the smell in the air, and the sheen 
to some of the pools of blood, it’s seen recent use. 
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was converted into a tor-
ture chamber over the years, though it is unclear 
who made this alteration and when. The shackles 
are crude, pinned into the wall with rough pig 
iron spikes. 
The Room has not been entered in some time. 
And while the hallway is subject to troglodyte musk, 
the Room itself is free of the odor. All of this may 
lead to questions from the PCs.
Tactics: Despite the atmosphere, the Room is an 
excellent place for the PCs to rest.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this trap, have 
the radiant energy damage all non-good characters. 
To decrease the challenge of this trap, have it reset 
after one hour.
A33-A34 . THE AMBUSH 
The following description covers the hallways and 
alcoves south of Room A33 including locations A 
and B. It also examines the tactics of the troglodytes 
defending the area. This is a complicated encoun-
ter. Remember the PCs, along with any other living 
non-troglodytes, are considered poisoned while in 
this area unless they have taken suitable precautions. 
Read the following carefully before proceeding.
Remember that the PCs, along with any other living 
non-troglodytes, are considered poisoned while in 
this area unless they have somehow managed to take 
precautions.
 
All four of the doors in this area are closed but not 
locked. 
 
The southern door is ajar. 
 
Having withstood the initial assault by the fiend-
ish darkmantles, the remaining troglodytes 
have prepared themselves as best as they can for 
subsequent attacks by placing six of their number 
in readiness for any additional threats (two each at 
location B and two behind the southern door).
Read the following text once the PCs near location A. 
Signs of battle are evident, as several of the flying 
octopus creatures have met their end in these hall-
ways. Their corpses have been cut open and their 
entrails line the floor. The smell of musk permeates 
the air, indicating someone must have escaped 
the fight.
Initial Attitude: Hostile (Initial) or Indifferent (after 
PCs retreat)
Encounter: Over a dozen fiendish darkmantle corpses 
have had their tentacles and bodies sliced open. The 
resulting mess of blood and organs makes the floor 
intentionally slippery. PCs moving through the area 
must succeed at a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw the 
moment they step into location A. Failure causes 
them to slip and fall prone in a bloody mess.
Even if a PC avoids slipping, the noise made by 
moving through the coagulated blood and squishy 
organs is overheard by the troglodytes hiding at 
location B unless the PCs take specific actions to 
avoid this.
Should the PCs attempt to move quietly, have 
them make DC16 Dexterity (Stealth) checks to see 
if they succeed. PCs using light sources (except 
for candles) are automatically detected before they 
reach location A. 
Two troglodyte warriors hide in the darkness in 
each alcove — east and west. These locations are 
marked with a “B”; both troglodytes occupy a single 
square). Although they blend in as well as they 
can, the fact is they have nowhere to hide and are 
thus easily spotted by anyone who looks into either 
alcove and succeeds at a DC 8 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check.
The remaining troglodytes hide behind the 
south door, ready to pounce. From here, they keep 

 54
an eye on the hallway. They are much harder to 
spot, requiring a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Given the tight quarters in this area, the 
troglodytes realize the importance of these alcoves. 
The moment they become aware of movement 
through location A, they ready themselves. Due to 
their desire for surprise, the troglodytes at location 
B cannot warn their compatriots hiding behind 
the door of the PCs moving in darkness (those not 
using light sources but making noise at location A); 
if those two do not hear the PCs then they cannot 
react during the surprise round. All troglodytes 
notice any light sources in the hallway.
Unless the PCs have a way of knowing where the 
troglodytes are, or are especially cautious, the trog-
lodytes gain one surprise round before initiative is 
rolled. The moment a PC enters the square be-
tween the two alcoves one of the troglodytes from 
each alcove takes a 5-ft. step and attacks with both 
troglodytes gaining a flanking advantage. The other 
troglodytes behind the door use the round to move 
down the hall (if they are not aware of the PCs 
when the troglodytes in the alcove attack then they 
cannot move until the first normal combat round), 
one behind the other, and hem the PC in position; 
they cannot attack until the following round.
Once combat begins, the troglodytes hold their 
positions with three of them engaging the PC 
caught between the alcoves (the two in the alcoves 
receiving flanking bonuses) and the other three 
providing backup for any troglodyte that falls. Al-
though they secrete their musk, the smell is already 
so bad that it has no further effect on the PCs.
Knowing that they are trapped, the troglodytes 
fight to the death. They do everything they can to 
stop the PCs from reaching the wounded in Room 
A34. Given the chance, the troglodytes push the 
PCs back onto the darkmantle corpses, knowing 
the ground is slippery. They flank without exposing 
themselves and go for deep leg wounds when pos-
sible. During the surprise round, consider giving 
the troglodytes sneak attack bonuses (1st level).
Given recent history, the troglodytes consider 
anyone that is not a troglodyte an enemy and attack 
to kill, giving no quarter. Any attempt to negotiate 
falls on deaf ears.
If the PCs retreat, the troglodytes do not pur-
sue, realizing they would be giving up a significant 
advantage by doing so. Since the rather desper-
ate troglodytes recognize that it was not orcs or 
beasts attacking them, allow a DC 16 Charisma 
(Persuasion) check if the PCs speak draconic (with 
advantage if no troglodytes were wounded or killed 
during the initial ambush), and attempt a parlay 
after retreating.
If Turag (from Room A28) is with the PCs and the 
troglodytes notice him, they demand to take him 
as a prisoner in exchange for information. Turag, 
of course, is against this plan but turns even more 
sniveling if the PCs appear to agree to an exchange. 
If Turag fought against the troglodytes, there is no 
chance of parley, and they focus their energies on 
killing the orc. The PCs are seen as allies and also 
dispatched without mercy. 
If parlay is successful, the PCs can speak to 
Yrkak, the troglodyte cleric from Room A34, though 
they are not past the alcoves. The lead troglodyte 
fetches him instead. The troglodytes share their 
own personal stories of the Region, but precious lit-
tle concerning Longtail and his plans. Yrkak recalls 
that when he last heard of Longtail the “rat-man’’ 
was heading to the east.
If the parley fails, the troglodytes leave the PCs 
alone as long as they do not return. In no way do 
the troglodytes join with the PCs. They are busy car-
ing for the wounded at the moment and enjoy their 
tactically sound position. Should the PCs render 
aid, they are most appreciative and offer them the 
acid flasks from Room A34.
Once the troglodyte warriors are healthy, the 
group attempts to leave the area. 
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change two of the troglodytes to incensed berserk-
ers. Their claw and bite attacks do two addition-
al points of damage, and the first time they are 
reduced to 0 hit points, they make a Constitution 
saving throw. On a success, they stay standing with 
two hit points remaining. To decrease the challenge 
of this encounter, remove the two troglodytes 
behind the door. They are inside Room A34, and 
wounded instead.

A33 . TROGLODYTE LIVING 
QUARTERS
The door to this room, as are all the doors in this 
area, is open. 
Several troglodytes lie in a fetal position on reed 
mats, otherwise this room appears to be empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: There are a total of six dead troglodytes 
here, having been arranged in the proper burial 
positions by their cleric (see Room A34). There are no 
other living troglodytes in the Room.

A34 . TROGLODYTE LIVING 
QUARTERS
The door to this room is open (as are all the doors in 
this section). 
Some badly wounded troglodytes lie on reed mats. 
Several others sit and sulk. One of them looks older 
and wiser, tending to the injured. In the south-
eastern corner is a collection of orc weapons, some 
armor, a pile of clothes, and a sack. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: There are a total of seven wounded 
troglodytes (hp 8, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0) within this Room. 
They are casualties of the fiendish darkmantle 
assault and are being tended to by Yrkak, a troglo-
dyte cleric.
Three of the wounded are incapacitated and at 0 
hit points, and the other four warriors are fatigued 
(2 levels of exhaustion, cannot use multi-attack) as a 
result of their recent action and wounds.
Note: If the PCs rest somewhere after the ambush 
before entering this Room, the troglodytes have 
had time to heal a little bit.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Yrkak is busy doing what he can for the 
wounded warriors and has already used his allot-
ment of spells to fight the fiendish darkmantles. If 
the PCs have killed the warriors in the hall, the trog-
lodytes see no chance for peace. The four wounded 
warriors engage the PCs immediately.
There is a chance for the PCs to negotiate here, 
but it is slim.
Yrkak kills the three disabled warriors (taking 
three rounds to perform the coups de grace), rather 
than having them fall into enemy hands. He makes 
a prayer to his god as he does, granting him advan-
tage on his next three die rolls after this. The mercy 
killings Yrkak carries out prove to be a mistake, 
however. In 1d4+1 turns, the dead warriors return 
to life as ghouls and proceed to attack the nearest 
target — whether troglodyte or PC. They’ve been 
inflicted with the same fiendish contamination as 
the orc the PCs might have encountered earlier. 
Should these ghouls somehow remain in the dun-
geon for a month or more, they gain the fiendish 
template as well.
Once Yrkak has finished with the three dis-
abled warriors, Yrkak joins any remaining war-
riors in combat, throwing the acid flasks at the 
strongest PCs. If the PCs have rested before en-
tering the room, he has his full complement of 
spells restored.

 56
Everyone fights to the death.
Treasure: Yrkak has an amber holy symbol of his god 
(100 gp) on a leather thong around his neck, a jav-
elin, a potion of healing (which he is saving for the 
worst), an oil flask, and 3 acid flasks.
The troglodytes have collected a number of scav-
enged items from some of the dead orcs. There are 
some suits of leather armor, some clubs, and axes. 
All of it is crudely made, but valuable in a pinch 
should the PCs be running low on supplies.
There’s also an orc pack that no one has gone 
through yet. It contains two bottles, 12 feet of 
scratchy rope, a halfling boot with a special lode-
stone inside, special wine in a wineskin, and a jar 
filled with toenails. The bottles contain a disgust-
ing alcoholic beverage that doubles as a cure light 
wounds potion. Drinking it requires a Con check 
(DC 14). If the PC fails, he throws up the contents 
and the potion is wasted. Otherwise, it works nor-
mally, but tastes horrible.
The lodestone compass always points north, 
except when around magical areas, in which case it 
just spins.
The wineskin is well made and looks custom. 
It contains a delicious human wine that was once 
worth roughly 100 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the wounded troglodytes be fully function-
al (they are still wounded but not exhausted) and 
increase their hit point totals by 4 each. In addition, 
Yrkak has not used his 2nd-level spell slots. To de-
crease the challenge of this encounter, make all the 
troglodytes exhausted and the disabled troglodytes 
don’t return to life.
A35 . OUTER CHAMBER 
This standard secret door is locked with a good lock 
(DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check) in the lower 
left corner of the door (DC 14 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check). The lock is part of the door and cannot 
be attacked separately. The door may only be locked 
or unlocked from the outside. Once the door is un-
locked, it may be opened in the usual manner. 
As you push open the door, a shriveled and partly 
clothed skeletal body falls into the passageway.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This is the body of an orc soldier, impris-
oned in this Room by his fellow soldiers when his 
madness overtook him. He ate most of his own 
flesh, as can be seen by the tusk marks etched into 
his bones. A broken sword lies next to the door, its 
blade snapped.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Propped into the southwestern corner is 
a broken repeating light crossbow, and a smashed 
hooded lantern (no oil).
Scaling: N/A
A36 . MAGAZINE 
The secret door is trapped to release a swinging block 
that hits anything within the doorway when the door 
is pushed open from Room A35. There are actually 
two such blocks, one for each side the door can be 
pushed in on. Only one can be triggered at a time 
due to the construction of the trigger mechanism 
which relies on the door opening into Room A36 
to operate. The hidden bolt bypass for each block is 
located just inside the door and using it requires that 
the door open slowly in order to access the locking 
mechanism just inside the doorframe. Pushing the 
door closed resets the trap. 
 '
Swinging Block Trap: +5 to hit one target. On a hit, 
deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage. DC 15 Wisdom 
(perception) check to find, DC 13 Dexterity (Thieves’ 
Tools) check to disarm.
Once the PCs open the door, read the following.
Several weapons, as well as barrels and cases, sit in 
a haphazard fashion within this room. They have 
clearly been ransacked, with most of the contents 
missing or strewn about the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was a storage Room for munitions 
and supplies. Orghur’s orcs have had their way with 
the contents; however, they left behind little.
Encounter Condition: Drafty, Extreme Cold, Safe
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: A small barrel of 88 crossbow bolts balances 
in one corner. Although there are racks to hold over 
20 polearms, currently only three spears are here. 
The cases have been smashed open and emptied of 

57
their contents. A small cask of oil (5 gallons) rests on 
top of the barrel.
Crumbled and wedged behind the barrel is a 
crude troglodyte tapestry. It is painted with various 
shades of blood and ichor, creating a monotone 
image of their tribe’s origin story: as the troglo-
dytes walk up from the divine river in a line, with 
the first bringing gifts to an already crowned king 
and queen. 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of the trap, 
raise the attack bonus of the trap to +8. To decrease 
the challenge of this trap, reduce the damage done 
by the stone block to 2d6.  
A37 - A40 . THE QUAD
Four large Rooms encompass A37 through A40, 
serving as ancient workshops. Although most of the 
tools are gone (having been taken by any number of 
humanoid races), the large furnaces and tables are 
still in place. 
Mostly empty, the area currently serves as a resting 
place for several fiendish beasts that have formed 
a convenient fellowship. Over the years, Achsyyx 
and other fiendish creatures have lured creatures 
here as food.
A37 . TOOLSMITH WORKSHOP 
The door to this Room is open and secured with a 
metal hook that holds the door in place, preventing it 
from accidentally closing.
 Several large workbenches are arranged in a 
haphazard fashion in this room. An unnatural light 
is cast across the floor and walls, with crooked 
shadows breaking the monotony. A familiar un-
ease sets in.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent or Hostile
Encounter: Fiendish darkmantles, rats, and stirg-
es have made their home here. The PCs can see 
from the doorway that the room is a nest for them, 
though it is unclear how many total monsters live 
here. Shadows and the scale of the Room make it 
difficult to discern what is what. This gives all of the 
creatures inside a huge advantage, as they can all 
see in darkness.
Roll 1d6 when the PCs enter the room to see the state 
of the creatures and the number present.

One darkmantle hovers in the air, as three 
resting rat swarms and five buzzing stirges 
prepare to strike.

6
Three darkmantles hide, as two rat swarms 
rest in the corners, and three stirges wait to 
pounce from behind.
While their tactics are not complicated (see be-
low), the gang’s makeup determines what the PCs 
see and hear.
Five workbenches show signs of heavy use under 
layers of dust. Various tools lay about the workshop, 
all of them either broken or in poor repair.
Encounter Condition: Safe, Soft Cover
Tactics: Combined, the darkmantles, rats, and stirges 
are a formidable threat to any PCs not expecting a 
three-pronged attack from the darkness.
In general, the darkmantles cast the room 
into darkness, the stirges puff themselves up to 
look bigger before swooping down, and the rat 
swarms bite at the feet and legs of the PCs sur-
rounding them.

 58
The darkmantles fight cleverly and do not let 
themselves get hurt. If they do, they fly up to the 
ceiling and try to disappear into the darkness. The 
rat swarms fight to the death, having no sense of 
themselves as individuals. If the stirges are wound-
ed, they flee to one of the other workshops. All of 
them are opportunistic fighters, going after the 
weakest PCs.
Keep track of which monsters go where (Room 
A39 or Room A40). They may ambush or face off 
against the PCs again later.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the number of each monster by 1 and add 
two fiendish dire rats. To decrease the challenge of 
this encounter, reduce the number of each monster 
by 1 (minimum 1).
A38 . WEAPONSMITH WORKSHOP 
The door to this Room is open and secured with a 
metal spike that has been driven into the ground to 
prevent the door from being closed. A DC 15 Strength 
check is required to pull the spike out of the floor.
Several large workbenches are arranged in a 
haphazard fashion in this room. A large furnace 
sits unlit in the northeastern corner. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: There are a total of eleven workbenches in 
this Room, all of them dust-covered and showing 
signs of heavy use. The furnace is functional, but 
unless the PCs have fuel with them, it cannot be 
fired up. Various tools lay about the Room that, if 
gathered together, make a set and a half of artisan 
tools (weaponsmith).
Upon searching the Room, the PCs find words 
scrawled in common in the dust of one workbench. 
“Fire trap. Beware.” The message was written by a 
human adventure (Room A99), and refers to the 
burning hands trap in Room A46, though the PCs 
won’t know this.
If the PCs can find a way to secure the door, this 
is a safe place to rest.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Consider rolling for a random encounter 
when the PCs enter, but not while they rest. 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: N/A
A39 . DESTROYED WORKSHOP 
The door to this Room is open and secured with an 
iron spike that has been driven into the wall to pre-
vent it from being closed. A DC 15 Strength check is 
required to pull out the spike. 
The workbenches in this room have all been de-
stroyed; all that remains is a furnace resting in the 
southwestern corner.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Whoever cleaned out this Room de-
stroyed everything with a sledgehammer, including 
the furnace. The mess is just the right place for 
eight fiendish dire rats.
Creatures fleeing from Room A37 may be found 
here as well.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Conceal-
ment, Hazardous Footing 15
Tactics: The fiendish dire rats rummage through the 
morass in the Room, trying to put together a nest 
in the furnace from the choicest bits. Although they 
are busy, they are still animals chewing away at 
bugs and filth. Regardless, one of them is likely to 
have an eye on the door while the others eat. It does 
not matter which. Sneaking up on the dire rats is 
difficult, especially if the PCs use a light source.
Whether or not the dire rats gain surprise, the 
rodents spread out to limit how many PCs can get 
through the doorway. The rest take defensive posi-
tions. Although they are defending their newly won 
home, these rodents are not eager to die and will 
flee if three or more of their number are killed.
Somewhere along the northern wall is a hole in 
the wall the size of a small dog. The dire rats can 
fit through it, one at a time, if they need an escape 
route. They might also use this to get into the hall-
way and then around to the door.
Treasure: A thorough search of the rubble reveals 
a bone hand (species unknown) wearing a mag-
ical signet ring. The ring hums and glows when 
the wearer is hungry. Once it is worn, it cannot 
be removed, without a remove curse spell. The PCs 
also find a small leather sack that has been chewed 
through. A few silver coins are still inside the sack, 
though it cannot be repaired.

59
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add three fiendish dire rats. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, remove two fiendish 
dire rats.
A40 . DESTROYED LABORATORY
The door to this Room is partially open, hanging by 
one hinge as the result of the explosion that ripped 
through this laboratory. The door blocks passage for 
Medium creatures (although Small creatures can 
squeeze through) and requires a DC 15 Strength 
check to open fully.
This room was obviously devastated by an explo-
sion. Scorch marks score the walls and whatever 
furniture once adorned the place is in shards. Here 
and there you can make out what appears to be 
a table or the leg of a stool, but otherwise the 
destruction is complete. 
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was a laboratory that was destroyed 
during a failed experiment involving fire evocation. 
The entire laboratory was virtually vaporized and the 
door was knocked off its hinge. 
The entire floor is covered in slivers of wood, 
chunks of stone, pieces of glass, and bone shards 
that halves movement and give disadvantage on 
Stealth checks. All of the debris is scorched in some 
manner and the entire place still smells of the 
smoke from many years ago. The remnants of a 
furnace sit in the northwestern corner, the explo-
sion reducing it to little more than a pile of rubble 
about the height of a man’s knee. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The floor is covered in debris. Sifting 
through the trash takes hours to find anything. The 
furnace, despite its almost total destruction, is a 
more promising area to search and any PC that suc-
ceeds at a DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
finds a short sword that looks almost unmarked by 
the devastation. This is a +1 short sword that was be-
ing prepared to receive further enchantments when 
the research detonated.
GMs may allow the PCs to place one 1st-level 
enchantment or transmutation spell into the sword, 
completing the ritual. However, this requires a DC 
17 Intelligence (Arcana) check to figure out what 
they were doing, as well as a DC 20 Arcana check to 
complete the ritual.
If it succeeds, such a spell would be permanent-
ly infused into the blade. The spell is then stored 
inside the blade to be cast once per day as a 1st-lev-
el wizard might cast the spell. Sleep, for instance, 
could be cast once per day by the sword, regardless 
of who wielded it.
Gamemasters may find this ability too powerful 
and instead give it 20 charges, in which case the 
spell eventually ends.
Scaling: N/A
A41 .-A45 . KOBOLD STRONGHOLD
Rooms A41 through A45 mark the borders of a kobold 
stronghold. This area was the first target of the orc’s 
assault. As the battle in this area reached its climax, 
a wave of extraplanar beasts joined the fray. Even a 
last-second alliance between the kobolds and orcs 
could not stop the onslaught. Currently a number of 
fiendish giant beetles and snake swarms explore the 
area, looking for scraps and nesting places.
Note: The fiendish giant beetles and snakes work 
together right now because there is enough food to 
go around. As soon as the food is gone, they will turn 
on each other.
Also Note: After Room A45, it is quite possible for 
the PCs to make navigation choices leading them 
north to Region E. If the characters choose to head in 
that direction, make sure the PCs have some means 
of reaching level 4. Whatever you need to do. Place 
a secret door map in between and let the PCs gain 
some XP, or just have them wake from a rest with 
an additional level, if needed. Alternatively, let them 
experience the first encounter in Region E and flee 
when it becomes clear they’re outmatched. 
Because this is the only area where fiendish beetles 
and snakes are found, it has its own random en-
counter chart.

17–20The PCs stumble upon an illusion.
A41 . KOBOLD GUARD POST 
The door to this Room is open and damaged.
Two dead orcs and four dead kobolds lay amidst an 
overturned table and broken stools. The bodies have 
started to decompose, their features gnawed upon. 
Their faces are unrecognizable and most of the 
fingers are gone.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This was a guardpost for the kobolds that 
occupied this area. The guards here were tasked 
with guarding the approach of anything from the 
“Maze:’ Breaking through the kobold defenses in 
Room A45, Orghar sent a squad of orcs through the 
western tunnel to deal with them. The corpses that 
lay here are the result of that skirmish.
Currently, three fiendish giant scarab beetles 
scurry along the floor and walls, feeding upon 
the bodies.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The fiendish beetles take a defensive stance, 
but do not immediately attack. The PCs may or may 
not recognize their behavior as a bluff. If not, allow 
them to make a DC 10 Wisdom (Nature) check to 
understand the situation. The fiendish beetles are 
not interested in combat and, if the PCs leave them 
alone, the beetles continue to feed without incident.
If the PCs attack, the fiendish beetles try to 
flee back to Room A44. If necessary, they fight to 
the death, but they would prefer to look for open-
ings to flee.
Treasure: Other than the standard arms and armor 
and the table and stools, one of the kobolds has 
some gold wire (5 gp) wrapped decoratively about 
his horns. In addition, there is an ordinary dagger 
driven into the tabletop with an agate in its pom-
mel (15 gp). 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
double the number of fiendish beetles and have 
them attack the PCs rather than flee. To decrease 
the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish 
beetles flee the moment they detect the PCs.
A42 . KOBOLD LIVING AREA 
The door to this Room is broken and off its hing-
es. Some kind of battering ram was used to break 
in the door.
Nearly a dozen orc and kobold bodies lie in this 
room along with a couple of the flying octopus 

61
creatures. The bar behind the door has been 
snapped in two and lies on the ground. Stools, reed 
mats, and blankets are strewn over the place along 
with what were probably the personal possessions 
of the kobolds who made this their home.
Initial Attitude: Hostile/Unfriendly 
Encounter: The kobolds and orcs fighting in this 
Room were surprised and overwhelmed by the wave 
of fiendish snakes that rolled through the area. 
And although the kobolds and orcs quickly banded 
together, it was too late.
Currently, two swarms of fiendish snake swarms 
pick out the choicest morsels among the numerous 
corpses, though the PCs would see it as one mas-
sive writhing mass of snakes. There are other snake 
swarms in the area, all of them getting their fill of 
the meat that comes off the corpses the easiest.
Some of the bigger snakes push through orifices 
and hollow portions of the torsos. They even feed 
on some of the dead darkmantles. The rhythmic 
consumption of flesh continues unabated, unless 
the PCs intervene.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Dis-
tracting Noises
Tactics: The fiendish snake swarm knows there are 
more snakes in the area. 
If the PCs attack, or get too close, one fiendish 
snake swarm flees to Room A44, leading the PCs 
past the fiendish rat swarms active there if they are 
able. If not, they fight and hope to force an opening 
that will allow them to flee. Only if no other option 
exists do they fight to the death. 
The sounds of combat attract the attention of 
the fiendish snake swarms in Room A44, and they 
rush to investigate the noise. They arrive in 1d3+1 
rounds with the other swarm.
If the PCs keep their distance, the swarms keep 
a wary eye on the PCs, but eventually return to 
feeding. Should the PCs get too close, though, 
fighting begins.
Note: There is only one entrance/exit in the Room. 
If the swarms intend to flee or get help, they must 
squirm past the PCs. Conversely, the GM can add 
holes in the walls big enough for the swarms to 
pass through and into the hall.
Treasure: Aside from several small stools and a dozen 
reed mats and blankets, the personal possessions of 
the kobolds have been strewn over the floor. They 
hold no value to the swarm and have been pushed 
aside. Some of it may have even been swallowed by 
the snakes.
PCs require a thorough Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check (DC 16) to locate any of the following 
items among the general litter and bodies — a 
kobold sized flute carved from a small thighbone 
(2 gp); a set of 26 polished stone playing pieces 
and game board (4 gp) stolen from a caravan; a 
tarnished, silver drinking cup with a dwarven in-
scription stating “Gretta’s Cup” (5 gp); a set of nine 
rough carvings made from ivory depicting various 
swamp denizens (17 gp total value); several of the 
kobolds are wearing horn coverings made of gold 
(in the shape of a cylinder and worth 3 gp each; a 
total of 8); eleven gems of low value (10 gp each) 
found in the pouches of three kobolds. 
Searching for treasure can leave the PCs dis-
tracted (disadvantage on Perception checks) during 
the arrival of the fiendish snake swarms from 
Room A44. 
Scaling: To increase the challenge, have the fiend-
ish snake swarms attack the PCs the moment they 
enter. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, 
have both swarms flee to Room A44 as soon as the 
PCs arrive.
A43 . KOBOLD CHIEF'S  
LIVING AREA
The door to this Room is open. 
The smell of blood in this room is close to over-
whelming. Kobold and orc dead, along with an 
almost equal number of the flying octopus crea-
tures, lie strewn about the room. A couple of large 
feline bodies can be identified in one of the corners. 
A small sea of drying blood coats the floor like a 
torn carpet.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was Borryn’s, the kobold chief ’s 
quarters and it was here that the battle between the 
orcs and kobolds reached its climax. Even as both 
sides inflicted heavy casualties on each other, the 
fiendish darkmantles fell on them and a three-way 
battle was joined during which all the humanoids, 
including Borryn perished. Their hasty alliance 

 62
managed to inflict some serious casualties on the 
fiendish darkmantles, leaving room for the fiendish 
snake swarms to move in.
So thick is the carnage in this Room that any 
creature moving across the sticky floor must suc-
ceed at a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw every time 
they move more than 5 ft. on a turn or fall prone 
among the viscera (disadvantage on Stealth checks 
due to the noise made when moving through the 
sticky blood). PCs who fall are partially coated with 
blood and gore. Given the carnage in the place, 
not even the fiendish dire rats have ventured 
into the Room.
Because of the massive carnage, it is impossible 
to tell what the Room once contained. A broken 
table, along with seven small stools, are scattered 
throughout the area, as are ten reed mats and at-
tendant blankets. The remaining items, mostly ko-
bold personal items that had been stored in sacks, 
are scattered about the Room amongst the bodies. 
Encounter Condition: Decrepit, Hazardous 
Footing 15
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The sheer damage done to the area and 
the sheer mess makes locating any small valuable 
items a chancy proposition; the bodies still have 
their usual arms and armaments. Most items are 
crushed or so drenched in blood that they are 
almost unrecognizable. Still, determined PCs may 
search (DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check) for 
the following items - a silver ring set with a moon-
stone on an orc’s hand (105 gp); six sets of the gold 
kobold horn caps (5 gp per each cap for a total of 60 
gp); an electrum earring in a kobolds ear (3 gp); a 
spear that lays near Borryn; a blue coral necklace (6 
gp) torn from the neck of an orc; a gold pendant in 
the shape of a tree (25 gp) around a kobolds throat; 
a pair of fine leather boots (50 gp) on the feet 
of an orc. 
An additional item of interest is a large chest sit-
uated in the southwestern corner of the Room that 
has an orc corpse slumped across it. This was the 
kobold chieftain’s personal chest and is locked with 
an average lock (DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools)); it 
is not trapped. It contains a bolt of purple silk (10 
square yards; 100 gp), a plain gold circlet (25 gp), 
five sacks of copper pieces (523 cp total), two sacks 
of silver pieces (147 sp total), one sack of gold pieces 
(92 gp total), a small pouch of platinum pieces (17 
pp total), and two pouches of gems (21 total gems 
of 4d4 gp in value). 
Note that searching for treasure can leave the 
PCs distracted (disadvantage on Perception checks) 
during the arrival of the fiendish rat swarms from 
Room A44. 
Scaling: N/A
A44 . KRENSHAR STABLES 
Both doors to this area are open. To the west is an 
opening devoid of a door.
This description assumes the PCs approach from 
the west. If they enter the Room from the southeast, 
ignore the “devoid of bodies” line.
This open area is divided by several walls into 
smaller individual spaces. The ceiling is extremely 
high as well, disappearing into the darkness. Straw 
is scattered across the floor, with animal dung 
throughout. The area is eerily devoid of bodies 
given the carnage in other rooms, though the 
smell of death is present. The sounds of something 
ominous can be heard around one of the many 
dividing walls.
Note: This is a complicated encounter.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Currently, there are a number of fiendish 
creatures in the Room, keeping to their respective 
places but on the verge of attack.
Two fiendish snake swarms wait in the north-
eastern corner for the fiendish rat swarms to leave 
the near center of the Room. Meanwhile, three 
fiendish darkmantles cling to the ceiling, some 80 
feet in the air.
This Room was used by the kobolds to stable 
their krenshar mounts. The kobold and mounts 
attempted to hold this area in the face of the orc 
onslaught but succeeded only in getting killed. 
Bloated maggots and pus-filled centipedes feed on 
the corpses, especially since the rats and snakes are 
waiting to feed. 
These waves followed a fiendish darkmantle 
swarm that had been released by Longtail and 
came to this Room directly from Room A108 via the 
one-way secret door in the western wall (see Room 
A108 for a complete description). Although the PCs 

63
may well decide to explore the eastern hallway, the 
nature of the secret door to Room A108 prevents 
them from entering Longtail’s chapel (unless they 
have the tools to chip through solid rock).
Should the PCs investigate, they will find two 
dead krenshar, one in the northwestern portion and 
the other in the southeastern portion, and two dead 
kobolds in the doorways in the corner. It is possible 
the PCs have never seen anything like these crea-
tures before. They look like deranged cat wolves 
without ears and spikey hair.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: All three groups are on constant guard 
against one another. They’ve been locked in a stale-
mate for days, waiting for the other to make a mis-
take. The presence of the PCs throws this balance 
into disarray, though. Some of the creatures will 
turn on the PCs, and some will turn on each other.
If the snake swarm from Room A42 has already 
summoned the snake swarms here, they are gone 
and the rat swarms have scattered to various cor-
ners of the Room. In this case, the PCs are left to 
face the rats and darkmantles at the same time.
If the snakes haven’t fled, or there are more 
snakes here from Room A42, the rat and snake 
swarms turn on one another, though some turn on 
the PCs as well. Should the PCs try to take advan-
tage of the infighting, the swarms stop fighting one 
another and fight the PCs.
The fiendish darkmantles wait for the perfect op-
portunity to ambush anything that moves, whoever 
is weakest.
In all, this encounter is an orgy of violence that 
should consume a lot of PC resources.
To make matters worse, Longtail may send 
Achsyyx from Room A103 if he hears the commo-
tion. If the PCs are 3rd level or higher, there is a 3 
in 20 chance for Achsyyx to appear after the combat 
is over. Additionally, there is a 1 in 20 chance that 
Longtail is with him. See Rooms A103 and A104. If 
they do arrive, however, they are likely to fall back to 
a safe position after a few rounds of fighting. They 
are only here as a scouting operation.
Additionally, the fight may proceed long enough 
to draw a random encounter.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add one more 
fiendish rat swarm and one more fiendish dark-
mantle. To decrease the challenge of this encoun-
ter, remove all of the fiendish darkmantles, but 
give the PCs the impression that something could 
be up there.
A45 . BARRICADED HALLWAY 
All the doors in and out of this hallway are open and 
partially damaged. They will never lock again. 
The bones of two large felines and a pair of kobolds 
are strewn about the hallway. Their clothing is torn. 
Rat carcasses litter the hallway as well. Centipedes 
and worms burrow through the remains. Makeshift 
barricades and battlements are nothing but splin-
tered wood now. But what was once an important 
front line is nothing now.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Protruding from the skull of the larger 
kobold is a crude, oversized knitting needle. It was 
improvised as a weapon during the fight by an orc 
and left there. The kobold weapons were stolen and 
taken back with the surviving orcs.
This Room was under constant patrol and de-
fense by two kobolds and two krenshars when the 
orcs attacked. Arriving simultaneously from both 
the east and west, the orcs slaughtered the kobold 
guards, sustaining no casualties themselves and 
leaving the bodies as a message to the others. The 
fiendish rat swarms came to feed on what re-
mained, having their way with the corpses, but they 
too died when orcs returned to retrieve their dead.
Now, maggots and vile-looking centipedes 
worm through the flesh of the dead, just like in 
Room A44.

A46-A56 . NO MAN'S LAND
Covering Rooms A46 through A56, this core portion 
of the Region was not claimed by the orcs or rep-
tilians and served as neutral ground — when the 
alliance was held. It was simply a pragmatic matter to 
deem the area free of hostilities, lest everyone perpet-
ually have knives to their figurative throats. 
Although some parts of the area did see heavy 
fighting — no treaty is perfect — large parts of this 
area were left alone for a long time. A number of un-
discovered secrets, traps, and treasures remain.
A46 . WORKSHOP 
The western door to this room is locked, but simple 
enough to pick, or break open with a DC 16 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) or Strength (Athletics) check. 
The southeastern door to this room is closed and 
trapped. Draconic writing on the door reads “Dan-
ger. Do Not Enter.” The doorway is trapped with an 
automatically resetting burning hands trap. The trap 
activates the moment any creature opens the door to 
Room A46. It shoots down from the ceiling in a cone 
shape, striking the square in front of the door on 
both sides. Because the vent is built into the archway, 
this trap is nearly impossible to spot. 
 '
Burning Hands Trap. Deals 3d6 fire damage in a 
15-foot cone. Creatures take half damage on a 
successful DC 8 Dexterity saving throw. DC 25 Wis-
dom (perception) check to find, DC 16 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check to disarm. Automatically resets when 
the door closes.
Read the following once the PCs open the door.
Although this room is now empty, you can all but 
guess at its previous purpose. A complete forge 
sits in one corner. A large workbench, along with 
two stools, dominates the center, while there are 
numerous hooks and nails on the wall, indicating a 
place where tools were once kept. A hallway leads 
on past this area.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was at one time a workshop. The 
place was cleaned out, but the forge couldn’t be 
moved. Although covered with dust, the forge is 
still functional if fuel is found.
There is a 3 in 20 chance of finding a fiendish 
fire mephit trapped in the furnace.  Silver-inscribed 
runes keep the mephit here. If the runes are bro-
ken, cracked, or somehow erased, the mephit es-
capes or returns to its home plane (GM’s choice). If 
the fire mephit is antagonized with water or liquids, 
it erupts in a ball of expansive flame, much like the 
trap in this Room.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: Assuming the PCs survive the trap or bypass 
it, this is an excellent Room to rest. 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the trap damage to 5d6, and the likelihood 
of a fiendish fire mephit being present to 7 in 20. 
To decrease the challenge of this encounter, reduce 
the trap damage to 2d6, and allow the fiendish fire 
mephit to grant one minor boon if it is freed.
A47 . LABORATORY
Several tables are pushed up along the sides of this 
room, along with a trio of stools. 
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was a magical laboratory. Unlike the 
one in Room A40, this one did not sustain any ma-
jor damage. The valuable equipment was cleaned 
out, but a couple of items were left behind. 
PCs examining the tables can note discoloration 
and burn marks from the use of various chemicals 
during the experiments. A DC 10 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) check of the Room reveals several piles 
of glass shards from broken beakers and contain-
ers. Bare-foot creatures have avoided the Room for 
this very reason.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises or Haunted
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: A PC willing to search (DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check) through the glass shards is 
rewarded with a small, flawed diamond (500 gp).

65
More importantly, the owner of the lab created 
three hiding places for some of his lesser creations.
The first is a small metal box, about 4 inches in 
length, 4 inches in width, and 2 inches in height, 
that attaches under one of the tables and is found 
relatively easily with a DC 11 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check. 
This box is trapped with a poison blade holding 
greenblood oil weakened with age. The razor-sharp 
blade releases when the box is opened, slicing 
across the box opening and cutting into flesh. A 
PC that shakes the box hears small objects rattling 
within. Unfortunately, this box is a red herring and 
contains only a few pebbles. 
 '
Poison Blade Trap. +7 to hit, one target within 20 
ft. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage 
and must succeed on a DC 8 Constitution saving 
throw or suffer 1 point of Constitution damage for 
24 hours. A creature immune to poison is immune 
to this effect. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check 
to find, DC 11 Dexterity (Thieves’ Yools) check 
to disarm.
A second hiding place is behind one of the rocks 
of the furnace. The mechanism is actually a flat 
piece of rock attached to a metal flap that is lifted 
to gain access to the space behind; it is revealed 
by a more difficult DC 18 Investigation check. This 
hiding place is also guarded by a spring-loaded 
punching dagger blade that flies out the moment 
the rock flap is lifted, punching itself into the face 
or chest of the person opening the door. The blade 
is coated with greenblood oil that has lost much of 
its potency. 
 '
Punching Dagger Trap. +7 to hit one target. On a 
hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage and must 
succeed on a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or 
suffer 1 point of Constitution damage for 24 hours. 
A creature immune to poison is immune to this 
effect. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 
11 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to disarm.
Located in the hollow space behind the mech-
anism are three arcane scrolls — magic missile, 
guidance, and flaming sphere. 
The final location is the most difficult to find 
(DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check) and is 
actually a hollow stool leg that contains a wand of 
acid arrow (17 charges). The wand gives no clue as to 
its function and identify only reveals the command 
word (bahris-kyh). If the PCs detect magic, the wand 
radiates magic, but no school can be discovered.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
restore the potency of the greenblood oil poison. To 
reduce the challenge, remove the poison.
A48 . COLLAPSING  
ENERGY FIELD 
The door to this area is closed and has draconic writ-
ing on it that warns “Danger. Do Not Enter.”
A large, shimmering ruby-red crystal about the 
height of a human floats in the center of the cham-
ber some three feet off the ground. The ever-present 
energy of both good and evil can be felt stepping 
into the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The ruby red crystal is the remnant of 
an energy field that once held a minor devil. It lost 
its primary function when the fiend escaped, but 
it still has enough energy to be dangerous should 
any person or object disturb its surface. The kobolds 
never touched it, sensing something dangerous 
about the stone.
The shimmering is actually a result of the slow 
ebbing of the field’s energy. Disturbing the energy 
field’s surface in a physical manner, be it through 
touch, using a pole, throwing a stone, etc., caus-
es the protective field to collapse in on itself and 
release the remaining energy in a 20 ft. radius all 
around the ruby. This release causes 3d4 points of 
force damage to all within the radius. Those caught 
in the blast can attempt a DC 12 Dexterity saving 
throw to take only half damage. There is no way to 
disarm the energy field. 
Encounter Condition: Drafty, Safe (if the PCs leave 
the ruby alone)
Tactics: The first time a PC speaks within earshot of 
the crystal, a devilish laugh echoes off the energy 
field. The sound pierces through the quiet of the 
area, alerting all the nearby Rooms that some-
one is here.
Treasure: N/A 

 66
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the force damage to 4d6. To decrease 
the challenge of this encounter, reduce the force 
damage to 2d4 and the radius to 15 ft.
A49 . THE LONG HALLWAY 
All the doors leading into this hallway are open. 
The length of this room extends beyond the edge 
of your light source. Here lies an orc corpse, there 
rests a dead kobold, and over there, a flying octo-
pus, with three of its tentacles severed, lies limp 
against the wall. Bones and other bits against 
another wall. The lengthy chamber is a miasma of 
corpses and debris. Scuffles have obviously been 
happening here for a while.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The key to controlling Region A lies in 
controlling this hallway, as it affords access to the 
rest of the dungeon. Orghar made it one of his key 
objectives when planning the orc assault. Although 
they were officially neutral, the kobolds realized the 
significance of this hallway, as well, and always kept 
a guard force nearby. Although numerically supe-
rior, the orcs had difficulty controlling the hallway 
due to the presence of Boyikt, a kobold wizard, and 
his brother Borryn. However, as with the battle in 
the kobold stronghold (Rooms A41 through A45), 
the sudden appearance of extraplanar beasts ended 
the fight in a way neither side anticipated.
Numerous dead lie in the hallway, including 
orcs, kobolds, a couple of krenshar, fiendish stirges, 
fiendish darkmantles, and even some fiendish dire 
rats (exact numbers up to the GM). Otherwise, the 
hall is strangely empty.
The smell is nearly as bad as the musk in the 
northwest corner of the region.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Given the importance of this place and the 
numerous paths for access, the GM should roll 
for Random Encounters while the PCs are in the 
Room. One roll when the PCs enter and another 
just before they leave is ideal, although there can 
certainly be more.
These encounters need not be hostile, though 
some creatures will be shocked to see humans 
(and their ilk) in the dungeon. Some might even 
have questions.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: Varies
A50 . KOBOLD GUARD POST 
The doors to this Room are open. 
Shackled to the wall in the southwestern corner is 
the skeleton of a kobold, standing over a reddish 
and green slime. The skeleton moves and twitches, 
kicking harder when someone approaches, but it is 
no use. The slime bubbles and gurgles, mimicking 
the pattern of your footsteps. 
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Although neutral by agreement, the 
kobolds kept a regular group of guards here. When 
the orcs attacked, the guards joined the battle in the 
hallway (Room A49).
Both the skeleton and slime radiate necro-
mantic magic.
Boyikt used his magic to turn some of the dead 
kobolds into skeletal warriors to join the fight. This 
one refused to stay down and they had to shackle 
it to the wall. The slime at his feet is the brain his 
skull once housed, now dissolved into a bloody goo. 

67
Should anyone cast dispel magic onto the brain, it 
returns to the shape of a kobold brain.
PCs investigating the Room have a chance to 
spot a metal plate trigger in the floor at the north-
west corner. When pressure is applied and kept on 
the plate, a loud click can be heard. When pressure 
is released, the click is heard again. This turns off 
and turns on the hallucination trap in Room A97. 
It wouldn’t take more than a few pounds of weight 
on the plate to keep the trap turned off. PCs won’t 
know what it goes to, but they will know it does 
something.

A51 . "THE COFFIN"
The door to this Room is closed. The smell here 
is as bad as the musk in the northwest corner of 
the Region.
Several skeletons of varying sizes lie about the 
room, rags hanging off their bones. The smell is 
almost unbearable, forcing you to cover your nose.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Given the Room’s isolation, it is ideal for 
body disposal. All manner of humanoid and beast 
has been thrown here over the centuries creating a 
distinct pile of bones and rotting flesh.
A large stone grind wheel has been turned over, 
but closer inspection shows it was used to grind 
bone years ago. Rust and decay have rendered it 
less than useful.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: There is a 1 in 20 chance of encountering a 
pair of kobolds or orcs disposing of a body while 
the PCs are present. They are not ready for a fight 
and may just want to step away, unless the PCs 
press for combat. There is an additional 1 in 20 
chance of a fiendish rat swarm having a meal. If 
neither of those events happens, there is a 3 in 20 
chance of a fiendish snake swarm present in the 
body pile, though it finds no need to attack unless 
necessary. There is plenty to eat.
Treasure: Some bone dust lies on the ground. 
Enough can be gathered to be used to create pro-
tection circles and the like as a powerful material 
component. A DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
reveals this information to a wizard or warlock. If it 
is used in this manner, it doubles the duration of 
the protection circle. 
Scaling: N/A
A52 . SECRET THRONE ROOM
The door to this Room is open. 
This large room has a simple throne carved from 
stone situated near the eastern end. Bits of chain 
and iron rings hammered into stone unleash a 
sense of dread. The taste and smell of something 
fiendish permeates the air. The sounds of groans 
and soft crying can be heard, but no one is there. It 
is as though the walls themselves are in pain.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: It is unclear who altered this Room and 
used it for evil, but minions were tortured here for 
the viewing pleasure of whosoever sat upon the 
throne. Sharp-eyed PCs can pick out numerous 
large rust-red stains on the floor (DC 14 Wisdom 
(Perception) check), the blood of those exe-
cuted here.
The throne is non-descript, having an almost 
alien appearance to the thrones of human kings. It 
has been hewn from a single piece of rock — just 
the right size for a dwarf or similar-sized creature. 
Two red gems are cut into the backrest, like eyes 
staring back at the PCs. Shadowy forms inside 
the gems enhance the creepiness of a parei-
dolic headrest.
There is a definite unease about this cursed 
throne. The vile deeds perpetuated by its owner 
have warped the stone into something evil and 
hateful. Any living creature who touches the throne 
is subject to the curse and must succeed at a DC 14 
Wisdom saving throw (rolled in secret by the GM). 
If the save fails, the cursed creature is afflicted with 
confusion but does not notice the change. If the 
save is made, the PC is still cursed but aware that 
something strange has taken place.
The PC is not aware of the curse at first and acts 
outwardly normal. However, anytime the PC is in a 

 68
stressful situation, such as combat or trying to per-
form a skill check quickly, the confusion surfaces.
Roll on the following table the first round that a 
PC is confused.
D20BeHavior
1-5
Attack the nearest ally (for this purpose, a 
familiar counts as part of the subject’s self )
6-7
Become nauseated (unable to attack, cast 
spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything 
else requiring attention. The only action 
such a creature can take is a single move 
action per turn)
8-13
Cower (take no actions, –2 penalty to Armor 
Class and loses his Dexterity bonus)
14-18
Flee away from the area at the top pos-
sible speed
19-20
Twitch uncontrollably (–2 penalty on attack 
rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and 
ability checks)
The confused condition passes the moment im-
mediately thereafter or when a stressful situation 
passes. Note that the curse can afflict any number 
of creatures and can be countered just like the spell 
bestow curse.
Otherwise, the curse lasts for a number of days 
equal to 16 minus the PCs Wisdom score at the time 
of the curse (minimum two days).
The painful sounds emanating in the room grow 
louder the longer the PCs remain. Tormented spirits, 
though not manifesting as threats, still live within the 
blood, chains, and walls. They will remain here forever 
until a cleric or other holy person casts a spell that 
can release them. Even something as simple as bless 
might do it.
PCs who get too close to the chains and iron rings 
find themselves grappling with animated chains. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the Wisdom saving throw DC to 17. To re-
duce the challenge of this encounter, the curse lasts 
only one day.
A53 . WESTERN GALLERY
Rooms A53 and A54 share the space, though encoun-
ters are slightly different.
The southern door in the hallway is open. Read the 
following description once the PCs have moved down 
the hall and turned west. 
A number of skeletons from a range of creatures 
hang on the walls spaced equally apart, iron spikes 
visible below their bones. More bones dot the floor, 
spread out and broken.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: After the demons broke out, hundreds of 
years ago, they took over portions of the dungeon 
in a mad orgy of violence. For a time, Room A53 
served as a “gallery of torture.” During its time, the 
walls held the mounted corpses of a number of 
creatures from drow to duergar and every human-
oid in between. Since then, time has reduced the 
corpses to skeletons making it more difficult to 
identify the individual species of each.
The exact composition of the bodies is up to 
the GM; any humanoid up to Large size is present. 
Given the limited encounters that the PCs of levels 
1 to 3 have had with humanoids, they probably can’t 
identify the various creatures, although such things 
as an ogre, an orc, a dwarf, an elf, a halfling, etc. 
might be familiar.
Once complete, a number of the skeletons are 
missing such things as a head, an arm, a leg, etc. 
Casting animate dead on these bones produces truly 
disturbing skeletons.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions or Haunted
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: Some personal effects might be found 
among the bones, but nothing of immediate value. 
Bracelets, rings, dull knives, earrings, costume 
jewelry, and combs (for instance) are among the 
various items strewn around the room.

A54 . EASTERN GALLERY
Rooms A53 and A54 share the space, though encoun-
ters are slightly different.
The southern door in the hallway is open. Read the 
following description once the PCs have moved down 
the hall and turned east. 
A number of skeletons from different creatures 
hang on the walls spaced equally apart, iron spikes 
visible below their bones. More bones dot the floor, 
spread out and broken.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Identical to Room A53 in shape, this 
Room houses the more unusual skeletons of the 
collection, such as mummified lamia, and the 
rotted carcass of a two-headed wolf-dog-creature 
(exact composition is up to the GM) all mounted on 
iron spikes.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises or Haunted
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: A half-suit of bone armor hangs from an 
iron peg. It is made for a larger-than-average hu-
man but provides armor protection like chain mail. 
Scaling: N/A
A55 . GUARD ROOM 
The door to this Room is closed.
Pieces of broken furniture and a dirty floor indicate 
someone once lived here. A single broken bed lies 
near the center of the room. Rubble and rags have 
been piled up in the northeastern corner. The smell 
of unwashed feet and disgusting food linger in the 
air. One can almost imagine orcs still living in here.
Initial Attitude: Varies 
Encounter: Behind the rubble is a near-dead orc (1 
hp), who was left behind during the last retreat 
through here. The other orcs assumed he was dead 
when he didn’t respond. Rather than leave their 
friend out in the open, they left him behind the 
rubble. They took his weapons and personal effects, 
however, leaving him with pants and boots.
How he escaped the notice of the fiendish crea-
tures nearby is anyone’s guess.
The orc has numerous wounds and a dented 
skull. If the PCs are able to heal him and bring him 
back, he has amnesia. He doesn’t even know his 
own name. He does not speak Common and may 
not be able to communicate with the PCs. The orc 
will not join the PCs and will run the first chance 
he gets. If forced to help, he will pretend to be an 
ally before running into the dungeon when they are 
not watching.
Stats are not provided for this orc. If the PCs 
choose to kill him, the fight is over quickly.
Encounter Condition: Deep Darkness
Tactics: Four rounds after the PCs have been in the 
Room, four hungry fiendish darkmantles enter 
looking for a quick meal. They immediately turn 
the Room dark with their aura and then descend 
to feed. They fight desperately and to the death in 
some depraved fashion. They make hungry, gnash-
ing noises that impart disadvantage to the PCs 
during the first round of combat. 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the orc turn on one of the PCs in a fit of fear 
and panic. He tries to steal an item and run away 
with it or bash someone from behind with a rock. 
To reduce the challenge of this encounter, reduce 
the number of fiendish darkmantles to three.
A56 . GUARD ROOM
The door to this Room is closed.
A broken table lies upturned against one wall, while 
a heavy wooden chest leans against the table. The 
walls and floors are non-descript, though there are 
dozens of tally marks cut into one wall. Along the 
floor are various, tiny torn pieces of paper.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room served as the home of a guard 
captain, but any functioning furniture was cleaned 
out during a regroup and retreat. The table was left 
alone as it had no value. The chest was left because 
it holds a special trap.
The chest contains a silver dagger wrapped in 
the skin of a darkmantle. The skin has been care-
fully cut from the organs, stretched, and made into 
a wrap, or small cloak. It’s unclear of its intend-
ed purpose.

 70
 Once the skin is unraveled a glyph of warding 
is exposed. The glyph of warding (explosive runes) 
affects only the character holding the skin, dealing 
5d8 lightning damage and forcing the character 
to scream in pain. A successful DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw halves the damage and the character 
does not scream. The dagger is not affected by the 
spell.wwwScattered on the floor are tiny shreds 
of paper, perhaps from a journal or log. Whatever 
was written on them was in another language, and 
few full words remain. PCs may attempt to piece 
it together, revealing a kobold letter detailing the 
mind-numbing work of being a guard.

by 2. To decrease the challenge of this encounter,

A57-A77 . EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE
Both the reptilians and orcs avoid the area covering 
Rooms A57 through A77 and the hallways in between. 
Almost destroyed in the heavy earthquakes that dam-
aged the entire complex, the area is unstable. Chunks 
of the ceiling lay everywhere, making it an easy place 
to hide in but a difficult place to maneuver through. 
When the occasional tremor rumbles through this 
portion of the complex, it causes more dust, dirt, and 
rocks to fall from the ceiling, giving the entire area a 
sense of imminent annihilation; no creature willingly 
makes its home here. 
That is not to say that there are not currently some 
residents. Extraplanar scavengers roam the area hop-
ing to find an easy meal. A handful of reptilian refu-
gees also hide in the area, hoping to escape notice. 
The unstable and damaged condition of the area 
creates an interesting tactical situation for the PCs 
and any creatures that rely on land movement. The 
rubble that is strewn everywhere hampers movement 
throughout the entire area; each square moved costs 
double. The rubble also prevents any land-based 
charges or running throughout the entire area. Final-
ly, any land-based attempts to Stealth are rolled with 
disadvantage due to the rock and grit underfoot.
Note: Major tremors in this Section have the 
potential to collapse parts of tunnels, sections of 
Rooms, block doors, etc., making it even more diffi-
cult to move through the area or even get out at all. If 
a door or passage is blocked by rocks, it requires 1d20 
minutes to clear the space for a Medium creature to 
squeeze through.
A57 . NEARLY EMPTY ROOM
The door to this Room has been wedged partial-
ly open by the earthquake and requires a DC 18 
Strength check to force it completely open.
Darker than most rooms, rubble and dust cover the 
floor. Squinting your eyes, you can see a small boot 
sticking from behind a stack of rocks.
Initial Attitude: Varies
Encounter: This Room appears empty, but if the PCs 
investigate they find the boot is on the foot of a hal-
fling near death. The halfing is hiding from nearby 
creatures and hoping for some kind of intervention.
The purpose of this encounter is two-fold. 
One, this is a chance for the PCs to meet an NPC 
who may or may not join the group. Two, if a PC 
has died, this halfling could be their replacement. 
Therefore, the name, class, and gender of the hal-
fling are left for the gamemaster to define.
If the halfling remains an NPC, he/she/they 
slipped into the dungeon by accident a few weeks 
ago and snuck around in the dark avoiding the 
dangers. The halfling doesn’t know where the major 
factions are in this area, but might be able to draw 
a crude map of earthquake hallways.
The halfling knows there are nearby monsters 
and speaks quietly. The halfling is also slathered 
in some kind of oil and musk that is reminiscent 
of skunk and lavender. It is strange, but not over-
whelming. It conceals his/her/their scent from the 
nearby rats.

71
Encounter Condition: Tremors 14
Tactics: Allow any creatures or random encounters 
(perhaps prep them after this) in Rooms A58, A60, 
A61, and A62 to roll Wisdom (Perception) checks at 
advantage opposed by a Stealth check by whoever 
opened the door to Room A57.
Should the PCs decide to kill the halfling, the 
combat is over in seconds, but the creatures in 
Room A58 definitely hear it without requiring a roll.
Note: If the PCs have already dealt with the 
other monsters, ignore the concerns about noise. 
though the halfling may be more ready for the 
group in such a case.
Treasure: The halfling carries a wineskin, two more 
days of rations, a perfume bottle with oily perfume, 
a torch, some rope, and a personal weapon. If the 
PCs have already made a level or two before arriving 
here, the weapon is magical.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
place a small hole in the wall between Rooms A57 
and A58. Something might come through when 
the PCs least expect it, or the creatures in Room 
A58 already hear the PCs coming. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, do not allow the nearby 
creatures an advantage of any Wisdom (Percep-
tion) checks.
A58 . FIENDISH MEPHITS 
The earthquake forced both doors off their hinges. 
They lay on a pile of rubble just inside the doorway. 
The western one is far worse than the eastern one, 
which acts as a semi-barrier to entry.
This rubble-strewn room appears to have an exit; 
you can make out the top half of a door in the 
wall across from this doorway. Darkness and dust 
shroud the contents as strange shadows dance on 
the walls.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This Room is filled with rubble. Parts of 
the ceiling have given way, collapsing inward, along 
with dirt and granite. There appears to be three 
fiendish darkmantles among the rocks near the 
center of the room. However, they are exceptionally 
difficult to distinguish from dust, dirt, and boulders 
(DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check).
Also hiding amongst the rocks is a fiendish dire 
rat. It waits to feed on whatever falls into its lap. It 
is not aggressive, but will defend itself.
Encounter Condition: Poor Footing 4
Tactics: The well-camouflaged fiendish darkmantles 
are, in fact, fiendish steam mephits wearing the 
hides of dead darkmantles. Most likely, the mephits 
gain surprise and can move and attack before the 
PCs. They roll initiative separately, acting as unique 
individuals. The mephits wait until a PC is within 10 
ft. to attack, throwing off the dead skin onto the PC, 
and then taking action.
The first mephit casts misty step (which lasts 
for 1 minute) and teleports to behind the PCs, the 
second mephit uses its steam attack, and the third 
mephit flies into melee range with an exposed PC, 
using its claw attack. Mix it up round after round, 
after this.
Treat the mephit’s use of the darkmantle skin as 
a ranged attack, at advantage. If a mephit hits, that 
character is blinded until an action is spent remov-
ing the skin. If the attack fails, the skin falls to the 
ground with no effect.
The fiendish dire rat only fights if it needs to, 
helping the mephits flank if the opportunity arises. 
The mephits tolerate the rat and vice versa, though 
they turn on one another if the need arises, most 
likely after the fight is over.
The rubbled floor creates uneven footing for the 
PCs meaning any Dexterity check or saving throw 
is made with disadvantage. This does not affect the 
fiendish steam mephits, nor the fiendish dire rat.
Misty step works up to 30 feet, so one of the 
fiendish steam mephits can teleport just out-
side the door or to the other side of the Room if 
necessary.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter 
add two fiendish dire rats and have them en-
gage the PCs aggressively. To decrease the chal-
lenge, remove the darkmantle skins from two of 
the mephits.
A59 . CLOSET 
The earthquake caused the lintel above the door 
to collapse. As a result, the door requires a DC 15 

 72
Strength check to open, which causes the lintel to 
collapse further, like a falling block trap.
 '
Falling Block Trap. +7 to hit one target (whoever 
opened the door). On a hit, the target suffers 3d6 
bludgeoning damage. DC 12 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check to find, DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check 
to disarm.
 Once the door is opened, read the following text. 
Peering through the narrow juncture, you can see a 
number of opened chests lined against one wall of 
this small room. 
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The Room contains four opened and 
emptied wooden chests of varying sizes and qual-
ities and one closed one. Some torn sacks lie on 
the floor as well. Some soiled blankets remain from 
when someone used this Room to rest. Metal shav-
ings and chipped stone lie inside one of the chests, 
where someone has sharpened a blade.
Inside the closed chest is a warlock’s familiar, a 
cat. During a fight, the cat hid in the chest and it 
snapped shut. He’s been in there for days, unable 
to get out. The warlock is presumed dead, but 
is actually alive in Room A99. The cat’s name is 
Gypsum, though it’s a cat so it won’t respond to the 
name anyway.
The PCs are welcome to take the cat with them, 
though the cat still behaves like a cat despite its 
high intelligence. Should the PCs attempt to com-
municate with the cat (using empathy, magic, skills, 
etc.), they must succeed on a DC14 Intelligence 
(Arcana) or a DC14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) 
check. If they offer the hungry Gypsum some food, 
this check is made at advantage. If they win Gyp-
sum over, the cat quickly comes to understand their 
objectives slightly better and tries to attach itself to 
a magic-user, preferably a wizard (or someone who 
can take on an animal companion).
Should the GM approve, a PC may always cast 
find familiar on the cat, adding it to his retinue. And 
should the party find the warlock (Nylinn) in Room 
A99, he will probably want his cat back.
Once the Room is cleaned up, this is a safe place 
for the PCs to rest, especially with only one way in. 
It is even possible to rig up a pulley, using a rope, 
to enable the fallen lintel to be raised and lowered 
from within quite easily–negating the need for a 
Strength check each time the PCs wish to enter. 
With a little thought, the PCs could turn this into 
an effective outpost for themselves.
Encounter Condition: Safe, Tremors 10
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: Amidst the debris on the ground are a few 
soiled blankets and shards of metal. PCs succeed-
ing at a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check find 
a torn bag filled with 16 gp and a chipped eye agate 
(55 gp). This eye agate belonged to the now-miss-
ing wizard.
All of the chests have long since been looted.
There is one of interest, however. On a DC14 
Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) 
check, a false bottom can be discovered in one of 
the chests. Beneath the false bottom is a portal 
connecting this chest to one of the other empty 
chests in Room A67. Any item of small size passed 
through this portal ends up in the chest in A67 and 
vice versa. This magical effect is permanent, and 
the distance between the two chests has no impact 
on how effective it is. Clever PCs can likely think of 
dozens of ways of making use of this connection. 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools) DCs of the falling block trap to 20 
and increase the damage to 3d6. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the Intelligence (Investigation) 
and Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) DCs to 12 each and 
reduce the damage to 1d6.
A60-A63 . SOLITARY CELLS 
These small cells are near-identical. The door to each 
is closed, but there is a locking bolt on the outside. 
The PCs may deduce that these were holding cells for 
something.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Due to their narrow construction, these 
former cells have managed to escape the damage 

73
suffered by the rest of this area. Each cell contains 
a series of crude graffiti depicting orcs triumphing 
over their foes, bullying troglodytes, and crushing 
kobold skulls beneath their feet. They contain little 
essential information, but if the characters take 
some time to study them, they gain advantage 
on their next Intelligence (History) or Intelligence 
(Investigation) check related to the orc presence in 
the region.  
The doors to these cells are fully functional.
There is a 3 in 20 chance of finding the rem-
nants of an extraplanar creature’s remains under 
the rubble.
Encounter Condition: Drafty or Stagnant Air, Safe
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
A64 . SOLITARY CELL
The door to this Room is locked with a bolt on this 
side. Opening the door is easy enough, but the PCs 
may ask first, “What is locked inside?”
A rotting dead orc lies on top of a pile of rubble. 
The earth below is ruptured, and viney plants grow 
up around the rubble wherever it can reach. Some 
of the plant life has tangled around the rotting 
corpse, begging the question: how long has the orc 
been dead, and how fast do the vines grow?
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Captured and killed by the kobolds, this 
orc sorceress was thrown into this cell and locked 
inside after being strangled. To be sure she could 
not come back and harm them, the kobolds locked 
the cell from the outside.
The plants in this cell grow faster because of the 
magical nature of the orc. She continued to exude 
magical energy, even in death, drawing the plants 
closer to her. In time, the vines will eventually ani-
mate the orc, and she will return as a revenant with 
some druidic powers.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The shin bones of the orc have come loose 
from the flesh and cartilage. Since the orc was a 
sorcerer, the bone has some magical properties. 
But to what end? The GM is encouraged to allow 
the PCs to get creative with it if they clean it up and 
study the bone.
Scaling: N/A 
A65 . SOLITARY CELL
The door to this Room is open.
Pushing open the slightly open door, you see 
another cell filled with rocks and destruction. 
Rubble piles up, cracking the stonework. Exposed 
dirt beneath the floor shows signs of viny plants 
growing through the cracks. And with plant life 
comes insects.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly 
Encounter: As the PCs stay longer in the Room, more 
and more insects climb up the vines. This may not 
be noticeable at first, but eventually the floor will 
be filled with bugs. Every manner of bug. After 15 
minutes, enough bugs will appear to form a fiend-
ish insect swarm.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs stay too long, the swarm burrows 
its way into their boots and bites at their feet. If the 
PCs leave, the swarm eventually finds them an hour 
later. If the PCs defeat this one, another swarm 
shows up in one week’s time.
For some inexplicable reason, the swarm cannot 
see/sense elven characters, who become immune to 
the swarm’s attacks. This should not be evident for a 
few rounds of combat.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a second swarm, three rounds after this one 
appears. To decrease the challenge of this encoun-
ter, allow the PCs Wisdom checks to notice the 
swarm forming one round before it attacks.
A66 . PRISON 
All of the doors to this Room are open.
The floor is covered in rubble. Wood and linen 
lie crushed under hundreds of pounds of stone. 
Centipedes and other bugs feed on whatever they 
can find, turning on one another as well. A dead 

 74
dire rat lies on its side, bloated stomach exposed to 
the elements and being eaten from the inside out 
by insects.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Everything is buried under rubble that 
comes up to the average human’s waist. Although 
this Room reveals nothing of interest, it is the gate-
way to the vault at Room A67.
The PCs must clamber across the top of the 
rubble to reach any of the numerous doors in 
this Room. Doing so requires a successful DC14 
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
A failure results in 1d3 falling damage as the char-
acters tumble down, shredding hands, knees, and 
dignity. The PCs only need to make this check the 
first time they attempt the rubble.
The walls here are unstable and it is possible for 
the PCs to cause a wall to collapse inward. If they 
are clumsy or dash around the Room without a 
care, have the wall collapse on someone.
 '
Collapsing Wall Trap. Creatures in a 15-ft. cube must 
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 
bludgeoning damage. Creatures that succeed take 
half damage. DC 14 Investigation check to find, DC 
16 Strength check to disable.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: N/A 
A67 . PRISON VAULT 
The door to this Room is partially open. Rubble 
blocks the doorway except for a narrow 1-ft. wide 
opening. Inside, magical darkness eats up most of 
the light.
Though the door will not budge, you can see into 
the room from the doorway. The darkness of this 
room becomes evident. While you can see the edges 
of the room from your torchlight, the light only 
barely reaches. It is as though the darkness was 
swallowing the light.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was once a prison vault for items of 
minor importance. Magical darkness stops light 
from traveling too far or illuminating the details. 
Any check related to sight suffers disadvantage on 
the roll. Dispel magic will not negate this magical 
darkness, and a light spell is only a temporary fix.
A Small creature or smaller can crawl through 
the opening without a problem. A creature of Medi-
um size must succeed at a DC 19 Dexterity (Acro-
batics) check to pass through the existing opening. 
A Large creature or larger cannot pass through.
Attempts to widen the opening require caution. 
A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
reveals that the entire thing will collapse unless 
properly shored up and also how to go about doing 
so. If these skills are not available, then treat the 
threat of collapse as a falling block trap.
 '
Falling Block Trap. +7 to hit one target (whoever 
opened the door). On a hit, the target suffers 3d6 
bludgeoning damage. DC 12 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion check to find, DC 16 Strength (athletics) check 
to disarm.
 Widening the opening properly requires 1d6 
hours. Attempts to widen the opening without the 
benefit of a successful check results in the entire 
thing collapsing and burying the entire doorway 
under rubble, causing the damage stated in the 
trap description above. Ironically, doing so creates 
an opening large enough for a Medium creature 
to crawl through near the top of the doorway. The 
vault itself is in good shape, having been well de-
signed. There are a total of 5 chests in the vault, all 
of them open.
Encounter Condition: Tremor 18
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: One of these chests is the sister Telepor-
tation Chest to the first one, found in Room A59. 
Determining which requires a DC14 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check. Beyond this, all of the chests 
are empty except for one that holds a small black 
silk bundle about 1 ft. long. This bundle contains 
five metal batons with a continual flame spell placed 
on the tip. Although not designed as a weapon, they 
can be used as such in an emergency (treat them 
as clubs).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the attack bonus of the falling block trap to 

75
+9 and the damage to 5d6. To decrease the chal-
lenge, reduce the damage to 2d6.
A68 . COLLAPSED GUARD POST 
The door to this Room is partially open. Rubble 
blocks the door, and a DC 14 Strength check is re-
quired to push it open. The PCs can smell smoke and 
burned flesh coming from inside.
The smell of smoke and charred flesh fills the air. It 
is not suffocating, but smells awful. Although there 
has been a partial collapse of the ceiling, which has 
crushed much of the furniture that was once here, 
there are still three chairs in one piece. Two bodies 
lie burned to a crisp along one wall.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was a guard post a while ago, 
but the furniture was left behind when the ko-
bolds retreated south. The chairs are unremarkable 
and made for creatures with shorter build. There 
is a weapons rack behind the door, holding four 
rusty spears.
A pair of kobold bodies lie burned, having died 
from disease — most likely the mold from one of 
the earlier Rooms. The kobolds set fire to the bodies 
to kill any infection.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The spears, despite being dusty, are 
fit for use. 
Scaling: N/A
A69 . RESERVE BARRACKS 
The door to this Room is open. 
Large portions of the floor of this room are strewn 
with rubble. The numerous cracks in the walls do 
not suggest much safety. Rows of dark wooden 
bunk beds, most of them damaged by the rubble, 
give some clue as to what this area was used for.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: As a former reserve barracks, this area was 
emptied of anything of interest when the previous 
occupants left. The bunk beds are clearly designed 
for humanoids. 
Currently Boyikt, the kobold wizard (and broth-
er of the dead kobold leader Borryn), four kobold 
warriors (hp 14, 9, 8, 8), and a krenshar occupy the 
Room. Having escaped the orc assault and the 
subsequent attacks by the extraplanar beasts, the 
kobolds have sought refuge. They have regrouped 
and sometimes send scouts out for a way out of 
the dungeon. Presently, four kobold foot soldiers 
have taken the route south and then east in search 
for an exit. 
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Cover
Tactics: The kobolds always have one of their number 
along with the krenshar stationed near the door 
keeping an eye, ear, and nose out on things. PCs 
using light sources are quickly spotted, and even 
those moving silently and in darkness cannot es-
cape the krenshar’s scent ability. The remaining ko-
bolds have built an impromptu fort by piling stones 
in the southeast corner of the Room, sectioning off 
a 10-ft.-by-10-ft. region. This provides three-quar-
ters cover and advantage on Dexterity saving throws 
and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. 
Once the krenshar and/or kobold guard spot 
an enemy, the two retreat back to a small blind 
near the fort gaining half-cover. The kobolds hope 
that danger passes them by and remain silent. 
If this does not work, they ambush their enemy 
with surprise.
While waiting to see what develops, Boyikt 
prepares magic missile as a held action while the 

 76
remaining kobolds prepare their slings as held 
actions. The kobolds attack with their slings the 
moment the first PC steps through the door while 
Boyikt casts his magic missile. The krenshar holds its 
scare ability in readiness should the PC attempt to 
advance into the Room.
Once the opening shots have been fired, the 
combat can go any number of ways. If the PCs wish 
to shoot it out with distance weapons and spells, 
they can take advantage of the cover offered by the 
doorway, the rubble, and the beds. In general, this 
provides half cover. If they choose to charge at the 
fort they find the going across the rubble-strewn 
floor slowed (the rubble is considered rough ter-
rain) while being subjected to Boyikt’s area effect 
spells. The kobolds continue to fire their slings 
while the krenshar makes use of its scare ability; the 
physically smaller kobolds avoid physical combat 
whenever possible, only using their spears when 
the krenshar resorts to its natural weapons.
Boyikt holds his spells in reserve for critical mo-
ments. He picks off weakened PCs with ray of frost 
and acid splash, but holds his area of effect spells 
such as color spray and sleep until he can get maxi-
mum effect out of them. One particular combina-
tion is to cast mirror image when the PCs get too 
close, and then vampiric touch to keep the enemy 
guessing which image cast the spell. He might also 
cast animate dead on a fallen krenshar.
The well-prepared kobolds are a strong chal-
lenge to the PCs and if combat can be avoided it 
should be. The kobolds are paranoid, afraid of ev-
erything that moves and for this reason they attack 
any non-kobolds that come into the area. However, 
that does not mean they are unwilling to negoti-
ate. After all, their situation at present is less than 
comfortable given not only the monsters roaming 
the dungeon but also the instability of this area. If 
the PCs choose to negotiate, either before combat 
starts or even after, Boyikt listens.
Boyikt’s attitude is indifferent for the purpose of 
resolving any Charisma (Persuasion) checks con-
cerning a cooperative arrangement once hostilities 
cease. If Turag (Room A28) is with the PCs, impose 
disadvantage on the Persuasion check. Although 
the exchange should be role-played rather than 
relying on dice. If the PCs manage to establish 
rapport with Boyikt then he demands an exchange 
of information.
Boyikt can relate his experiences concerning the 
battles with the orcs and the coming of the ex-
traplanar beasts. More importantly, Boyikt believes 
the beasts are coming from the northeastern Re-
gion of the dungeon, and he suspects that Longtail 
is behind the appearance of the creatures, although 
how precisely that came about is a mystery. He can 
tell the PCs about the secret door to Room A108. 
The kobolds discovered it while they were securing 
their area but were unable to open it (let the PCs 
come to the conclusion that it is a one-way door on 
their own as Boyikt only knows they could not get 
the door open).
Although he is free with information, Boyikt has 
no intention of joining the PCs to face Longtail. He 
has a healthy dose of respect for the wererat sorcer-
er and has no intention of going to the place where 
he suspects all those beasts came from. If the PCs 
say that they are looking for a way out, Boyikt and 
the kobolds may become convenient allies of the 
PCs, but only if Turag is not with the party (Boyikt 
cannot be persuaded to change his mind on that 
point and, in fact, wants the orc dead before mak-
ing any deals).
If the kobolds do accompany the PCs, they insist 
on being treated as equals. Of course, Boyikt is 
smart enough to realize that if the PCs are really 
heading for a showdown with the wererat (heading 
east is a strong clue), then he and the kobolds part 
ways with the PCs. 
In combat, the kobolds’ preferred tactics are to 
engage from a distance and gang up on opponents 
whenever possible; fighting alongside the PCs, they 
prefer to let the PCs do the close-quarters fighting 
while they pepper the opponents with sling stones, 
rushing in to attack and finish off weakened foes.
Being trained in teamwork, the kobolds work 
closely with the PCs and coordinate their attacks 
with them. They help out the PCs to the best of 
their ability, although always with an eye to their 
own safety, and expect the same from the PCs. 
Boyikt is a decent tactician and is especially adept at 
using his spells to the best effect. However, he will 
always try to hold a spell or two in reserve (usually 
sleep and mirror image) just in case the alliance with 
the PCs goes sour. In a worst-case scenario, he uses 
his scroll of tiny hut to escape the PCs for as long 
as possible.

77
Whenever the kobolds are on the move, one 
kobold warrior and the krenshar take the lead 
acting as scouts and they suggest the same if they 
are traveling with the PCs. Once the scouts have 
spotted something, they sneak back to the remain-
ing kobolds and report the situation. The kobolds 
prefer to avoid combat when possible and sneak by 
opponents rather than face them. PCs that insist 
on fighting everything they see find the kobolds 
leaving them.
If facing combat, the kobolds set up an ambush 
in the most favorable location — one that restricts 
the movement possibilities of their foes while 
allowing the kobolds to concentrate their missile 
fire and using the krenshar’s scare ability to prevent 
any enemy rushes at their positions. Because of 
the krenshar’s good movement rate, they use the 
creature as bait to lure extraplanar beasts into a 
prepared ambush whenever possible.
Treasure: The kobolds have nothing to spare. Not 
even food. They might have some orc weapons they 
were able to scrounge, but even healing potions 
have been used to keep them alive. If the PCs kill 
all of the kobolds, they find Boyikt’s spell book and 
scroll, along with some of the trapmaking parts the 
kobold warriors have scrapped together. If the PCs 
are especially kind to any of the warriors, he shares 
a trinket with one of the PCs — a pebble that stays 
warm all the time. He personally uses it when he 
makes soup. Another kobold may share some of his 
edible mushrooms that he keeps in a warm sack.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the kobolds place trip wires across the floor, 
requiring a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to cross 
the Room without tripping and falling prone. To de-
crease the challenge of this encounter, have Boyikt 
ready sleep instead and make parlay a more obvious 
approach to the encounter.
A70-A77 . THE RUBBLE
While still a subset of a larger Section, these eight 
Rooms are daily uninhabited and ravaged by the 
earthquake. Only a few of these Room possess any-
thing of value as well. Random encounters are rare 
here, and most of the area has already been picked 
through. As such, the descriptions are fairly repetitive. 
GMs are encouraged to mix up the contents of the 
Rooms by dropping non-fiendish vermin here and 
there. None of these Rooms are safe to rest in.
A70 . LIVING QUARTERS 
The door to this Room is open.
 Rubble covers the floor and spills out into the hall-
way. A partially collapsed archway across from the 
door appears to give access to the room beyond.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The earthquake damaged this Room rath-
er heavily, and the rubble is piled at least knee-high 
everywhere. The archway to Room A71 has partially 
collapsed, although there is still enough space for a 
medium creature to duck through.
A tall but crude voodoo doll effigy has been left 
behind. It is made of leftover wood, bones, and orc

A71 . QUARTERS 
This room is slightly less damaged than the pre-
vious one, and you can still see portions of what 
must have been a bed peeking out from under the 
rubble piles.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This is another abandoned living area. 
The bed, although identifiable, is completely ruined. 
The remnants of a kobold war party ritual remain. 
There are bowls of coagulated blood, some candles, 
tied sticks, and colored chalk dust all around the 
ground. A severed orc hand stands out among the 
mundane items.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A

Treasure: If the PCs spent 15 minutes searching the 
Room, they eventually discovered a clay jar with six 
orc eyes inside. All of the eyes are discolored. The 
eyes have started to rot.

A72 . FOUNTAIN ROOM 
The eastern door from the hallway is open. The west-
ern door leading to Room A21 is closed and trapped 
(see Room A21 for trap description).
Chunks of rock of varying sizes create an almost 
mountainous terrain in this large and long room. In 
the center, a crushed fountain rests. Whatever was 
in the fountain is long gone.
 Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Rubble fills the Room in numerous piles. 
Medium-sized creatures and smaller can pick their 
way through but must use a full action to move 5 
feet in any direction, including diagonally. Note that 
this is not a “5-ft.” step and thus provokes attacks of 
opportunity.
The basin/fountain that sat in the Room was 
crushed during the earthquake. The water was 
clean, and divine fish swam inside. Both are gone 
now. Even the meditation mats that circled the 
fountain are gone to the ravages of time.
There is still a faint holy energy about the place, 
however. This is a good place for a cleric to pray but 
not a safe place to rest.

A73 . MAKESHIFT BARRACKS
Both doors to this Room are open. However, while 
the door from the hallway is perfectly normal, the 
doorway leading to Room A74 is trapped with a 
resetting color spray trap (see Room A74). 
The top of a slightly dented but intact censer peeks 
out from the rubble in this otherwise empty room.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This large Room was yet another of a 
series of makeshift barracks for the orcs, but the 
rubble made living conditions difficult. They moved 
on to the east but fought off more fiendish crea-
tures along the way.
A censer was left behind by its previous occupants as 
it was too big to carry. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The censer is about 4 ft. high and weighs 
180 lbs. It is made of wrought iron with an uncov-
ered bowl at its top. Bas relief designs cover the 
censer, revealing a very pricey item. The whole item 
would fetch a handsome price (250 gp) from a col-
lector if the PCs could carry it out of here.

A74 . SLEEPING CHAMBER 
The secret door between A74 and A75 is readily iden-
tifiable by a line of over a dozen iron spikes that have 
been driven into the space between the door and the 
door sill. The wedged spikes increase the Strength 
check required to open this door to 27, making it 
all but impossible to do so, especially from Room 
A75. Each spike is wedged in tight and requires a DC 
23 Strength check to remove, although having the 
proper tools (such as a sledgehammer and a pry bar) 
grants advantage to the check.
The southern door leading to this Room is trapped 
and activates the moment any creature touches the 
door. A DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a 
round nozzle above the door, which might alert the 
PCs that this is a trap. The color spray covers the 
doorway as well as a cone-shaped area 15 ft. into 
Room A73. 
 '
Color Spray Trap. Creatures in a 15-ft. cone must 
succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be 
blinded for 1 minute. DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to find, DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
to disarm.
This room is covered with dust and rubble. You can 
make out stained and faded images on the walls. 
Mold and decay climb the walls from wet spots in 
the walls’ deepest creases. You hold back a cough as 
your torchlight dances off the walls.

crushed gold and lead goblet amid splinters of fur-
niture. The goblet is worth roughly 20 gp if melted 
down. Inside a false bottom of the goblet lies a 
small, thin, rusted key.

allow a Random Encounter after the trap triggers. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the DC to notice 
the trap by 2.
A75 . ASSISTANT QUARTERS 
The secret door between A74 and A75 is readily iden-
tifiable by a line of over a dozen iron spikes that have 
been driven into the space between the door and the 
door sill. The wedged spikes increase the Strength 
check required to open this door to 27, making it all 
but impossible to do so, especially from Room A75. 
Each spike is wedged in tight and requires a DC 
23 Strength check to remove, although having the 
proper tools (such as a sledgehammer and a pry bar) 
grants advantage to the check.
The north and south doors to this Room are open. 
The damage seems minimal in comparison to the 
other rooms in the area. There is, however, loose 
rubble on the floor. A number of skeletal, rust-red 
rodents scurry from your light.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Sniffing their way through the rubble 
are several dozen weak fiendish rats. They are part 
of a fiendish rat swarm, but not enough to be a 
major threat. Yet. They are what remains of the rats 
in Room A76.
Encounter Condition: Fog 10
Tactics: The fiendish rat swarm is spread out over 
both Rooms as individual members search for their 
own hiding places in the rubble. The moment the 
PCs’ presence is detected, the fiendish rats in Room 
A75 run to Room A76. Three rounds later, a fiendish 
rat swarm flows from Room A76 and attacks.
This process starts the moment the PCs are de-
tected, either through a light source or through the 
rodents’ scent ability (30 ft. to detect presence, 5 ft. 
to pinpoint location). Once the fiendish rat swarm 
is formed, it pursues the PCs mercilessly, fighting 
until it is destroyed.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add three fiendish dire rats. To decrease the chal-
lenge of this encounter, have the fiendish rat swarm 
be only at half strength (half hit points and cover-
ing only a 5 ft. by 10 ft. area; all other stats remain 
the same).
A76 . ASSISTANT QUARTERS 
There is a secret door between Rooms A76 and A77. 
A DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the door, 
but a DC 20 Strength check is required to open it. 
The earthquake has made the door easy to spot but 
wedged it against the wall. 
The northern door to this Room is open. 
This room is slightly damaged. Only a smattering 
of rubble dots the floor of this massive room. Two 
relatively intact beds and a small table remain.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Sniffing their way through the rubble are 
several scores of weak fiendish rats. They are part of 
a fiendish rat swarm, but not enough to be a major 
threat. The rest of the swarm is in Room A75.
The beds, really just pallets with legs, are rub-
ble-covered, and one is cracked. The small table 
is intact. Inside the desk is a letter, written in an 
ancient form of elvish, which the PCs may or may 
not be able to decipher. It details the contents of 
the cells (Rooms A60 through A65), though the 
contents of those Rooms are long gone.
Encounter Condition: N/A

A77 . EXPERIMENT ROOM 
There is a secret door between Rooms A76 and A77. A 
DC 14 Perception check reveals the door, but a DC 20 
Strength check is required to open it. The earthquake 
made the door easy to spot but wedged it against 
the wall. 
The northern door to this Room is open.
This large room shows some signs of deteriora-
tion but looks to be relatively intact. Skeletons of 
various sizes hang limply from a number of mana-
cles that are attached to the wall in various places. 
More skeletons lie on the floor, their legs shackled 
via a chain to a large iron spike that has been driv-
en into the center of the floor. A small lockbox lies 
against the southeast corner. It has been smashed 
open and some of the wood is rotted.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was once used to study the 
effects of magic on anything and everything. The 
unfortunate would be shackled to the walls or 
shackled to the spike in the center of the floor, and 
various spells would course through the victim’s 
body. PCs that examine the walls or floor see a 
number of scorch marks as well as places where the 
floor is cracked or melted. 
Any intelligent creature that touches any of the 
manacles, chains, or the spike in the center of the 
floor must succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom save or fall 
prey to the emotional remnants that still haunt 
this Room. Those who save see fleeting images of 
torture in their minds for one round, but otherwise, 
nothing happens. Those who fail the saving throw 
are paralyzed for 2d4 rounds as the anguish of 
those who died in this Room floods through them. 
The entire experience is so powerful that it leaves 
the creatures shaken (disadvantage on attack rolls 
and ability checks) for 1 hour afterward. Animals 
and beasts can sense the emotions in this Room 
and do not willingly enter it. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The lockbox is unusually heavy and radi-
ates transmutation magic. Anyone examining the 
box sees remnants of an old book, now covered in 
mold. Instinct tells the PCs the book is over 200 
years old. The book is written in common, though 
by a simpleton. It is filled with records of the exper-
iments that were conducted here. GMs are welcome 
to detail just how grotesque the experiments were 
and what those effects would be on the reader.

A78-A99 . THE WIDENING GYRE
The convoluted hallways and strange locations of 
Rooms A78 through A99 show the celestial’s dedi-
cation to traps within traps within traps. Building 
corridors where they were not needed, erecting secret 
doors to areas of no relevance, and planting traps to 
fill the emptiness, they befuddled and confused the 
prisoners of this dungeon for centuries. 
The lack of logic and straightforward access made 
this Section a prime location for the treasure-hunting 
activities of the humanoids, who braved its twisting 
corridors and hungry traps in search of the gold 
promised to them by Longtail. After all, who would 
build something as convoluted and trap-ridden as 
this without having something to hide?
It was in this area that the tenuous alliance be-
tween the orcs and reptilians faltered as search teams 
stumbled upon other search teams, and neither side 
could truly tell who had the rights to which Rooms. 
The situation was not helped by the fact that entire 
search teams from both sides were wiped out by 
traps, naturally leading each side to believe that the 
other had killed them.
Currently, the area is home to large numbers of 
extraplanar beasts who are competing for the right to 
establish nests in the area. As Orghar and a few orc 
survivors huddle in a small Room, the orc war lead-
er’s mind slowly disconnects from reality. Finally, the 
lizardfolk guides have found temporary shelter (Room 
A96) in their search for an escape.
A78 . ANTECHAMBER 
The door to this Room is open.

81
Rotting barrels, crates, sacks, and some archaic 
tools fill the space. There seems to be no rhyme or 
reason for how things are stored. It’s as though 
a child stocked the room. A mixture of moisture 
and dust fill the room inexplicably. Bare footprints 
trace around the room in a meandering pattern. A 
hallway in the center of the opposite wall shows 
the way out.
The hallway leading to Room A79 is trapped (see 
Room A79).
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: There are dozens of small barrels (vine-
gar), crates, and sacks in unorganized piles. Most 
of them have been torn open (the barrels have their 
tops staved in, the crate boards torn away, and the 
sacks have been ripped open, some of their con-
tents spilling onto the ground). The humanoids ex-
plored this area and then reorganized it as though 
they were moving in.
Along the eastern wall is a rack filled with archaic 
tools too large for human hands. They defy logic. 
Some look like pliers, and others like drills, but not 
anything humans would conceive of.
If the PCs rifle through the contents, they find 
that the barrels contain vinegar (still good), the 
crates contain various discarded and rotted cloth-
ing, and the contents of the sacks are now lost to 
the mold.

A79 . TRAPPED PRISON CHAMBER 
There are two mouths to the hall between Rooms A78 
and A79 — north and south. The hallway is trapped at 
both ends with scorching ray traps. These traps trig-
ger the moment a creature enters the hallway from 
Room A78 and again as they exit into Room A79.
Piles of dust and burnt bones hint at something 
unusual. A dead giant rat stands at the first mouth 
opening. Down the hallway, a pile of clothes grabs 
your attention.
If either Turag or Boyikt are with the PCs, they can 
warn them about the traps. Whether they choose to 
do so is up to them. Regardless, they will not enter 
the hallway between the Rooms.
 '
Scorching Ray Trap. Three rays of flame attack up to 
three targets within 10 ft. +6 to hit, 2d6 damage per 
ray. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) to notice, DC 20 
Intelligence (Arcana) to disarm. Automatically resets 
after 1 round.
Once the PCs have moved past both traps, read 
the following text.
A series of iron bollards jut up from the stonework 
floor in a haphazard pattern. Some bollards have 
been shackled. Others have sigils and glyphs etched 
into them. One radiates a faint green glow. The 
room feels evil and unnerving...
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Numerous demonic creatures were once 
shackled here. Over the years, they have escaped 
into the nearby Regions or been destroyed by 
particularly fearsome wardens. The bollards once 
contained powerful magic to keep the demons in 
check, but that has faded. Evil energy persists where 
abjuration magic once stood.
PCs with empathic powers may be able to read 
what has happened here. Don’t ask for a roll; just 
provide the characters with feelings, intuition, and 
visions of the past. 
Encounter Condition: Smoke
Tactics: Once inside, this Room is a chilling but safe 
place for a short rest. No random encounters hap-
pen here. The denizens know better than to tempt 
the traps.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have each trap fire 4 rays each time they trigger (the 
rays can fire at different targets). To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, replace the scorching 
ray traps with burning hands traps, which deal only 
2d4 points of damage.
A80 . FIENDISH STIRGE NEST 
Note: This is a very difficult encounter, even for a 
3rd-level party. PCs are encouraged to back down if 

 82
their numbers dwindle. Gamemasters are encour-
aged to keep some stirges in reserve if too many PCs 
start to die.
Four extinguished and broken furnaces, one in each 
corner of the room, look out onto a floor littered 
with splintered wood. A large number of the flying 
bloodsuckers are hopping about the room. In the 
center of the room, a pale green aura fills an area 
about 18 inches across.
Even before the PCs arrive at the doorway, they 
hear the flapping and calling of the fiendish stirge 
swarm in this Room. The door to this Room is open 
and secured with a large iron spike that has been 
driven into the ground to prevent the door from be-
ing closed. A DC 18 Strength check is required to pull 
out the spike.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This area was once a workshop, destroyed 
years ago by escaped prisoners on a rampage. 
Currently, a large swarm of fiendish stirges has 
gathered here to make its home among the broken 
benches and empty furnaces. They sensed the evil 
here to be welcoming.
Encounter Condition: Safe (once the stirges are gone)
Tactics: There are a total of 20 fiendish stirges in this 
Room, making all manner of noise as they hop 
about, fighting each other for the ideal nesting 
place amidst the rubble. Due to the cacophony, the 
fiendish stirges have little chance of succeeding at 
a Perception check (they have disadvantage on the 
check) to hear or spot the PCs. However, any light 
source grabs their attention.
The fiendish stirges here are hyper-aggressive 
as they fight for dominance amongst themselves. 
Although they may notice the PCs, the fiendish 
stirges are not interested in pursuing them outside 
of the Room, so unless the PCs enter the Room, the 
fiendish stirges leave them alone. However, if the 
PCs enter the Room, the fiendish stirges attack. The 
easiest way to handle this is for the GM to divide 
the Room into quarters and assume that five or 
six fiendish stirges respond to the PCs whenever 
they enter one of the quarters while the remainder 
squabble amongst themselves. 
The same method is also used for area effect 
spells cast by the PCs or their allies. Whether the 
spell does harm or not, an area effect spell gets a 
response from the fiendish stirges that are in the 
area. If a spell covers only one quadrant, then only 
the five or six fiendish stirges within that quadrant 
respond. If it covers two quadrants, the 10 to 12 
fiendish stirges in those quadrants respond. How-
ever, unless the spell covers the entire Room, even 
if cast in the center no more than 10 to 12 fiendish 
stirges should respond. 
If the PCs remove the spike from the stone and 
close the door, the fiendish stirges are effectively 
trapped in the Room. Simply exiting the Room 
ends the encounter, and the stirges will even-
tually die.
No matter how many fiendish stirges attack, 
they seek out their own individual targets, prefer-
ring not to share their meal with anyone; the GM 
should spread the fiendish stirges out among all 
the available targets as evenly as possible, doubling 
up only when necessary. Because they are defend-
ing their territory, these fiendish stirges fight to the 
death, pursuing fleeing PCs out of the Room but 
not out into the hallway. 
Treasure: Resting on the floor, in the center of the 
Room, is a gold ring. It glows pale green and hums 
softly (if the PCs get near it). It is a ring of warmth, 
corrupted by the magic of the dungeon. It radiates 
a small degree of warmth at all times (whether or 
not it’s worn), and its presence here makes this 
Room hospitable. However, should a PC touch the 
ring, every stirge in the Room senses the distur-
bance and attacks.
The ring has no negative side effects other than 
the glow, which cannot be controlled, and casts a 
permanent light spell with a 1-foot radius.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
divide the Room in half instead of quarters (mean-
ing 10 fiendish stirges respond to an invasion of 
territory or a spell cast into each half ). To decrease 
the challenge of this encounter, the fiendish stirges 
are not hungry. They can only drain 5 hit points 
each, instead of the usual 10.
A81 . ORC GUARDS 
The door to this Room is presently open. Two orcs 
are on continuous duty in the doorway of this Room 
keeping an eye out on the hallway to the north and 
the secret door to the west. Both the secret door and 

83
the hallway door directly to the north of the doorway 
to A81 are closed.
The orc pair more than likely spot any approaching 
PCs, and close the door in response. The two hold the 
door closed as best as they can.
Read the following description when the PCs 
near the door.
A sturdy door stands before you. If you’re not 
mistaken, you just saw it move. Listening carefully, 
you think you hear voices inside.
The door does not lock, so an opposed Strength 
check is required to push the door open against the 
two orcs holding it closed. If the PCs get inside, read 
the following.
Nearly a dozen orcs stand, lean, and sit around 
the room that disappears into the darkness beyond 
your torchlight. Some are clearly wounded, others 
stand at the ready to fight off your entrance. On 
the floor is a large summoning circle of some 
kind, drawn in salt or something similar. Candles 
surround it, but they are not lit.
If the PCs have seen the table in Room A20, this 
drawing looks familiar to them. The drawing on top 
of the table is a crude version of this one, redrawn 
from memory. Orghar saw it in Longtail’s books, and 
he, in turn, tried to recreate it here, thinking it would 
help them all escape.
Initial Attitude: Hostile; Varies
Encounter: Orghar personally led the attack on Room 
A49 intent on establishing orc control. Meeting with 
surprisingly stiff kobold resistance, the orcs never 
noticed the emergence of the extraplanar beasts 
from Room A103 until it was too late. Forced to re-
treat, Orghar and his warriors fought their way back 
to Rooms A81 and A82, incurring horrific losses 
along the way. The door was battered by darkman-
tles and other creatures, rendering the lock useless.
There are a total of eight orcs (hp 18, 14, 13, 13, 
12, 12, 11, 10) in this Room, plus a berserker (hp 32), 
who is second in command to Orghar (Room A82). 
They are all that remains of Orghar’s clan, most of 
them still injured from the fighting. The health-
iest take turns standing guard, while waiting for 
Orghar’s leadership.
The orcs just want him to lead them from this 
forsaken place. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Two orcs stand guard near the doorway at 
all times. One keeps an eye out on the secret door 
to the west, the other one on the northern hallway 
door. Utterly spooked by the carnage that they 
witnessed, the moment either of those doors open, 
the orcs raise the alarm, close the door, and hold it 
from the inside. The berserker stands behind them 
but does not help hold the door.
The orcs know someone is coming and cannot 
be surprised, but it is unlikely the PCs are surprised 
either. There is a moment of shock when the orcs 
realize they are not fiendish creatures or kobolds. 
After the PCs push their way into the Room, 
both guards (the healthiest ones) and the berserker 
occupy the area around the doorway. The berserker 
meets the largest PC at the doorway.
The other orcs, wounded, take a round to get 
to their feet and ready their weapons. One orc 
runs to Room A82 to alert Orghar. The rest fight 
to the death — having nowhere left to go — but 
do not pursue fleeing PCs. If there is time and/
or the PCs take too long getting to the door and 
into the Room, the berserker quaffs his potion of 
bull’s strength.
Since the orcs hold their position within the 
Room, there is no immediate conflict unless the 
PCs attack. As such, the PCs can attempt to parley 
at any time. If they do not start a parley, a standoff 
begins. Eventually, the orcs will get gruff with the 
PCs and demand that they leave. Or worse.
If Turag is with the PCs, there will be questions 
(on both sides), but he encourages everyone to 
make peace. He hopes to rejoin his brethren and, if 
necessary, betray the PCs.
After enough time passes, Orghar arrives and 
demands someone speak. Though the orc attitude 
is initially hostile, the orcs are actually indifferent 
toward the PCs. Who are they anyway? Why are they 
here? This attitude remains even if Boyikt and his 
kobolds and/or Turag are with them.
Orghar’s goal for his group is survival, most 
likely by leaving the dungeon as quickly as pos-
sible. The PC’s presence indicates some hope in 
this regard. Regarding his own life, he does not 
care anymore.
If the PCs suggest an alliance, Orghar sudden-
ly comes to life. Seeing this as a challenge to his 

 84
power, the clan head dismisses talk of an alliance. 
Instead, he orders an attack on the PCs. How this 
situation evolves depends on how the PCs have 
acted and how the orcs perceive them.
If the PCs are obviously injured or in some way 
act inexperienced or unsure, the orcs do as Orghar 
commands, and a full-scale battle to the death be-
gins. If the PCs have the orcs’ respect, the warriors 
stand there unsure of themselves.
This vacillation angers Orghar. Calling up his 
rage, he attacks the PCs. Some of the orcs join 
the fight; others do not. Orghar has no intention 
of losing the leadership of the clan and fights to 
the death.
If the PCs kill Orghar, the remaining orcs 
propose an alliance with the PCs. The strongest of 
the remaining orcs suggests they work together to 
escape the dungeon.
While the orcs will work with the PCs and even 
battle alongside them, they do so with plans of 
eventually betraying their allies. As long as they 
fight the beasts, the orcs are highly motivated to 
do their part, but when facing anything else, they 
mind their own safety and let the PCs carry the 
brunt of the fighting.
If Boyikt is with the PCs, he encourages the PCs 
to attack along with his troops and finish the orcs 
off. If the PCs refuse, he baits the orcs, perhaps 
even casting a spell into the doorway, in an effort 
to start a fight. However, he does not engage the 
orcs while they have the tactical advantage. PCs 
can attempt to defuse the situation as they see fit, 
but the kobold wizard has a hostile attitude to-
wards any suggestions of an alliance with the orcs. 
Feel free to assign positive modifiers to attempts 
at Charisma (Diplomacy) checks with the kobold 
wizard if the PCs have saved the life of Boyikt 
or his kobolds. There is no way to convince the 
kobold wizard to ally with the orcs; either the PCs 
give up this idea of an alliance with the orcs, or the 
kobolds leave. If the PCs are foolish enough to try 
to stop the kobolds, the kobolds fight.
If Orghar arrives and there is a fight already in 
progress, he joins the combat with gusto, gaining 
an advantage on all rolls during the first round 
(the ring he wears drives him to kill, even in his 
defeated mental state). However, his malaise takes 
over two rounds later, in which he suffers one 
disadvantage on his first roll and one disadvantage 
on another roll the following round. Unless he sees 
some hope in the fight, Orghar eventually lowers 
his ax, gives up, and lets the PCs win, whatever that 
looks like in your game.
If Orghar dies while the others fight, the healthi-
est orc screams out with a battle cry, declaring him-
self the new clan leader. The rest accept until the 

85
battle is over and then fight amongst themselves 
for leadership.
This is most likely a bloodbath.
Treasure: Collectively, the orcs carry maybe 15 gp in 
various denominations, some trinkets, and their 
weapons. They have no magic, and only the ber-
serker possesses a potion, which he most likely has 
already drunk.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add four fully healed orcs or two berserkers. To de-
crease the challenge of this encounter, the orcs (not 
the berserker) are shaken.
A82 . ORGHAR'S SOLITUDE 
The door to this Room is open. Whether the PCs 
negotiate or fight their way past the orcs in Room A81 
to get to this point, the text is the same. 
A smaller room lies mostly barren, with floor mats, 
blankets, and some general adventuring gear 
strewn about the floor. Dirty candles have been 
knocked over and snuffed out.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This is Orghar’s private chamber. He is 
head of the clan of orcs that followed Longtail to 
the dungeon. Having watched virtually all his clans-
men die at the hands of the extraplanar beasts has 
caused his mind to drift.
Orghar is tall and powerful. Even for an orc, 
he stands half-a-foot taller than most. His face is 
a maze of scars, showing his experience in battle. 
Perhaps his prowess could be questioned, but his 
survival rate cannot. His left eye is missing, re-
placed with a glass eye that doesn’t match. It gives 
him a slight advantage when attempting to intim-
idate someone. There are tattoos all over his arms 
and neck, one for each battle he has won.
No longer interested in anything, he spends 
his time in this Room, lost in private reverie. He is 
morose and expects to die at any moment. His clan 
thinks he is dreaming up a plan for escape, but he 
has truly given up.
Orghar’s reputation within the clan is so great 
none of his clansmen attempted to replace him, 
even though he has led his clan to its demise and 
is exhibiting signs of mental illness. They have that 
much respect for him.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: One way or the other, Orghar has made it to 
Room A81 before the PCs find this Room.
Treasure: Orghar’s ring is a plain, unadorned circlet. 
It fits any finger perfectly. 
Orghar’s Ring: (Ring, Very Rare, Doesn’t Require 
Attunement)
While wearing the ring, your alignment changes to 
the next in sequence (so Lawful Good would be-
come Lawful Neutral; Neutral Good would become 
Neutral; and so on). You gain advantage when mak-
ing a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimi-
date) check against and with an evil creature. 
Scaling: N/A 
A83 . HOLY ILLUSORY FIRE 
The smell of burnt flesh and leather hangs heavy 
in the air.
This smell is part of the illusion. The door to this 
Room is closed and trapped; a fiery elemental-type 
creature is painted on the door. Describe it however 
you like to the PCs, as they’ve probably never seen 
one before. A fire spell triggers the moment a Tiny or 
larger creature touches the door. A large glyph signals 
the presence of the trap, however.
 '
Fire Trap: Fire erupts in a 10 ft. radius. Creatures in 
the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw or take 3d6 (illusory) fire damage or half on a 
successful save. DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check 
to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. 
DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) to disbelieve.

 86
Once the door is open, read the following.
The lighting inside the room is strange. There is a 
gray-blue glow coming from somewhere, but it is 
unclear where the source is. The ceiling, floor, and 
walls of the Room are covered in a thick layer of 
burnt slime. Embedded in the far wall is the imprint 
of an angelic shape, like a fossil cracked out of a 
stone. A simple, colorless glass sphere rests atop a 
stone pedestal in the center of this room.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The temperature of the Room is extreme-
ly hot, though this is an illusion. Characters spend-
ing too much time here suffer 1d4 damage (no 
save). Repeat this as often as necessary.
Turag and/or Boyikt do not trust this area of 
the dungeon. While they do not know this Room, 
they lost enough allies in this area that they will not 
enter. They will adamantly refuse, going so far as to 
fight a PC not to enter this Room.
A one-foot-diameter glass sphere rests atop an 
ornate pedestal. Glyphs and sigils cover the edges 
and legs. The glass appears to have something fiery 
inside, though it is blurry and unclear. It does not 
look humanoid but rather ghostly. Should a PC 
touch the sphere, the fire revenant inside ignites 
the PC’s hand and escapes into their body.
Encounter Condition: Extreme Heat, Smoke
Tactics: The PC appears to be on fire, but this is an 
illusion. The fire revenant is just a trickster spirit. It 
cannot harm the PC, but the PC will not know that. 
Each round, they will make contestsed Wisdom 
checks to see who controls the PC’s body for one 
turn. This continues until the PC has won three 
contests in a row or the PC is knocked unconscious.
Regardless, the revenant then escapes and dissi-
pates into steam. If the sphere is left in the Room, 
the fire revenant returns in one week. If the PCs 
take the sphere with them, it is extremely warm and 
heavy and makes for a nice centerpiece. Maybe it’s 
worth something.
Once the PCs have had a chance to rest, they 
realize the illusory fire damage isn’t real, and all 
of it heals, except for any damage the PCs dealt to 
one another.
Treasure: A careful examination of the angelic im-
print on the wall reveals a silver coin in the angel’s 
hand. It can be pried from the wall and taken as a 
fire token. Once removed, the coin feels thin and 
brittle. It is a one-use casting of fireball (6d6). The 
PCs won’t know exactly what it does until they flip/
hurl the coin.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
allow only half the damage to heal after a rest. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, allow the 
PCs to use the glass sphere to summon one fire 
elemental one time.
A84 . GREEN ICE 
The door to this Room is closed and cold to the 
touch. Anyone pushing open the door suffers 1d4 
cold damage. No save. Once the door is open, read 
the following.
The lighting inside the room is strange. There is an 
amber glow coming from somewhere, but it is 
unclear where the source is. The ceiling, floor, 
and walls of the Room are covered in a 
thin layer of translucent green ice. A 
simple dark gray box rests atop a 

87
stone pedestal in the center of this room. Two dead 
orcs lie at the foot of the pedestal.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The temperature of the Room is extreme-
ly cold. Characters spending too much time here 
suffer 1d4 damage (no save). Repeat this as often as 
necessary.
A one-foot-long dark gray stone box rests atop 
the ornate pedestal. Glyphs and sigils cover the 
edges and legs. The box has soft rounded edges, 
and it seems to devour both heat and light. The 
inside of the box is laced with cultivated yellow 
mold that bursts in a 10-ft. cloud when the box top 
is lifted.
 '
Box of Yellow Mold. A cloud of poisonous spores 
bursts forth. All living creatures within 10 ft. must 
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save or suffer 1d6 
points of immediate Constitution damage for 24 
hours. After 1 minute, they must succeed on the 
same save to avoid a further 2d6 points of imme-
diate Constitution damage. Creatures reduced 
to 0 Constitution die immediately. DC 16 Intelli-
gence (Investigation) check to find, DC 13 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools) check to disarm.
Note that even if a PC succeeds at the first 
check, he is still required to make the second save.
The lid of this box is weighted, so it always drops 
back down to close unless it is held open.
If either Turag and/or Boyikt are with the party, 
then either one of them can warn the PCs about 
the box (though the dead orcs should be warning 
enough). Whether they choose to do so, especially 
Turag, is another story.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: One of the keys the PCs found elsewhere 
in the dungeon opens the box without setting 
off the trap.
Treasure: A +2 ritual dagger rests inside the box. It 
cannot be held by evil or chaotic characters, how-
ever. Well. It can. But it does not confer a magical 
bonus to them.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
remove the dead orcs. To decrease the challenge of 
this encounter, reduce the damage of the mold to 
1d4 and 2d4.
A85 . SLEEP TRAP 
The southern door to this Room is closed and pulses 
with static electricity. Anyone pushing open the door 
suffers 1d4 lightning damage. No save.
The western door to this Room is closed and coated 
in a thick gray slime and some blood.
Once either door is open, read the following.
The lighting inside the room is strange. There is a 
purplish glow coming from somewhere, but it is 
unclear where the source is. The ceiling, floor, and 
walls of the Room are splattered with blood, fur, 
and bits of skin. An ivory tusk, less than a foot 
long, rests atop a stone pedestal in the center of 
this room. Two blackened pigs lie on the floor, guts 
splayed out, the bodies covered in maggots and 
flies. Oddly, there is no odor.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: There are two fiendish panthers resting 
in a corner of the Room. But the Room is so dark 
it has to make them out against the purple light 
(DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check). They have not 
touched the dead pigs and will not eat them.
On the pedestal is a tusk (see treasure). Should 
anyone touch it, a flare trap and sleep trap go 
off simultaneously — though the sleep trap only 
affects the PC touching the tusk. Whether the PCs 
successfully save against these trap effects or not, 
the flare negates the use of darkvision and low-light 
vision for 15 minutes.
 '
Flare Trap. Creatures within 20 ft. must succeed on 
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1 
minute. Trap resets after 1 round. DC 18 Wisdom 
(Perception) check to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Ar-
cana) check to disarm.
 '
Sleep Trap. Roll 7d8 to determine how many hit 
points of creatures this affects. Creatures within 
20 ft., starting with the creature with the lowest 
hit points, fall unconscious if the total roll exceeds 
their current hit point total. Each time a creature 
is affected, subtract their hit point total from the 
remaining pool before affecting the next creature.
Turag and/or Boyikt know nothing about these 
traps, but they have seen this Room configuration 

 88
before. They may or may not warn the PCs and defi-
nitely do not enter the Room.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), 
Concealment
Tactics: After the sleep trap triggers, the fiendish 
panthers spring into action and attack whoever is 
left standing, gaining surprise on the first round. 
Assuming, of course, the PCs didn’t spot the pan-
thers earlier.
Although aggressive, these fiendish panthers 
do not fight to the death. Being reduced to 50% 
or fewer starting hit points is enough to make a 
panther flee.
If healthy, the panthers pursue fleeing PCs.
Treasure: The tusk is carved with faint, archaic runes 
and shaped like a weapon, complete with pommel. 
It is a dagger of venom, radiating faint necromancy, 
and is evil, though it cannot be thrown like a nor-
mal dagger of venom.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add darkness to the trap that triggers one round 
after flare. In addition, having never seen the Room 
before, Turag and/or Boyikt consider the Room 
safe. To decrease the challenge, remove the sur-
prise round.
A86 . REFUSE ROOM 
The secret door at the end of the western hallway is 
easy to find, as the smell of garbage seeps through 
the cracks in the door. It rotates on a central pintel 
but is rather wide when opened. 
There is no door to this Room. The smell starts long 
before the PCs reach the doorway.
A bubbling mass of garbage covers most of the 
floor. The smell is unbelievably bad. Here and there, 
the handle of a broken tool or piece of furniture 
peeks out from the morass. Rotting matter is 
everywhere. Dead rats can be seen on top of the 
trash. The sounds of rats under the surface can 
also be heard.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This place is a refuse heap and, except 
for a 15-ft.-by-10-ft. area in front of the hallway, is 
filled knee-high with garbage. The bubbling of the 
garbage is caused by three fiendish rats swarms (hp 
18, 16, 13) moving beneath the filth. 
The smell is bad enough to require a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw as the PCs approach the 
Room. Failure indicates that the PC is considered 
poisoned while within range of or inside this Room 
(the poisoned condition lifts 1d4 rounds after exit-
ing the area).
Any PC spending more than a single round in 
the Room is also subject to catching an airborne 
variant of filth fever.
 '
Filth Fever. DC 11 Constitution save. On a failure: 
in 1d3 days, Dexterity and Constitution are each 
reduced by 1d4 until the disease is removed. Repeat 
save every 8 hours. Filth Fever ends after three con-
secutive successful DC 11 Constitution saves.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The fiendish rat swarms are busy rooting 
through the garbage and have a tough time notic-
ing the PCs (disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks), especially since the strong garbage smell 
completely masks the PCs’ odor from the rodents’ 
scent ability. Of course, once the PCs are noticed, a 
general squeaking alarm echoes as rat waves rush 
out from the garbage.
The fiendish rat swarms vigorously defend the 
trash pile and chase the PCs out of the Room if 
they flee.
The swarms flow over the adventurers, covering 
as many PCs as possible in their 10-ft.-by-10-ft. 
area. Only one fiendish rat swarm may cause dam-
age to a given PC each round, even if he is within 
the space occupied by two swarms; there simply 
isn’t enough space.
In addition to the smell and the disease, the gar-
bage signals an additional danger. Over the years, it 
has been outgassing, and given the tepid nature of 
the air in the dungeon, this gas has been building 
up. The churning of the fiendish rat swarms has 
released this gas, which represents a great hazard 
at this point. Any open flame (such as a torch or 
spell such as burning hands) that enters the area 
ignites the gas. This creates a non-magical 5d6 
fireball that covers the entire Room plus the first 10 
ft. of the hallway (Dexterity saving throw, DC 15 for 
half damage). 
PCs without the scent ability have trouble 
distinguishing the smell of gas from the smell of 
garbage unless they succeed at a DC 18 Intelligence 

89
(Nature) check or a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check. Any creature with the scent ability can figure 
out that gas is present. Note that just because a PC 
notices the gas does not mean that the fire hazard 
becomes evident. 
Treasure: A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals 
a +1 longsword among the debris, should anyone 
be brave enough to dig into the trash, though this 
risks disease again.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a fourth fiendish rat swarm. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, decrease the fireball 
damage to 3d6.
A87 . SECURE PRISON 
The door to this Room is closed and trapped with two 
traps. The first trap is a scything blade trap. Pushing 
the door open releases the blade, which is located 
on the interior wall next to the doorframe, so that it 
swings down and cuts the hand of anyone pushing 
open the door. A hidden bolt near the top of the door 
can be slid into place to block the blade from falling 
(DC 15 Wisdom check to find). A counterweight resets 
the trap the moment the blade has finished its path 
of travel.
 '
Scything Blade Trap: +6 to hit, one target, 3d8 slashing 
damage. DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.
The second trap is a lightning trap that triggers 
whenever a Tiny or larger creature crosses the thresh-
old. The lightning strikes down from the lintel to 
the floor and can affect only the creature within the 
doorframe at the time of the triggering.
 '
Lightning Trap. Deals 5d8 lightning damage. Crea-
tures take half damage on a successful DC 15 
Dexterity saving throw. DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to find, DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana) check to 
disarm. Resets after 1 round.
Any humanoids with the PCs are unable to 
tell about the exact nature of the traps. They can 
share with them the fact that it is more than likely 
trapped. If they so choose.
 Once the PCs open the door, read the following. 
This was clearly a prison cell at one time — shack-
les everywhere — and then refurbished as an 
armory. The large room is home to a number of 
weapons mounted on the wall. From polearms to 
swords, from axes to bows, the collection seems to 
be missing nothing. In addition, a number of suits 
of armor also hang about the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: N/A
Encounter Condition: Drafty
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The weapons themselves are actually well 
taken care of and can be put to use immediately. In 
addition, each weapon is etched in both dwarven 
and giant runes, providing the origin and name of 
the weapon. The weapons are considered unique 
masterpieces worthy of gifts to kings. Depending 
on how much treasure the PCs have amassed so 
far, the GM should consider making one or two 
items magical.
The following arms and armors are readily avail-
able (each item appears only once).
Tailored for a Derro: Studded leather armor, buckler, 
short sword, repeating light crossbow (a light cross-
bow without the loading tag), and a vial of green 
blood oil hanging from a chain on the crossbow.
Tailored for a Drow: chain shirt, light shield, rapier, 
hand crossbow, a vial (single dose) of Drow poison 
hanging from a gold chain that, in turn, hangs 
from the chain shirt. 
 '
Drow Poison. On a hit, the target must succeed on 
a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be rendered 
unconscious for 1 minute. At the end of 1 minute, 
the affected creature can repeat the save. On a fail, 
the creature is unconscious for 24 hours.
Tailored for a Duergar: chainmail, heavy shield, war-
hammer, light crossbow.
Tailored for a Dwarf: scale mail, heavy shield, war axe, 
short bow.
Tailored for a Human: chainmail, medium shield, 
longsword, light mace.
Tailored for a Kobold: leather, spear, sling.
Tailored for an Orc: studded leather armor, fal-
chion, javelin.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the lightning trap to 7d8. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, decrease 
the damage of the lightning trap to 3d8. 

 90
A88 .-A93 . THE LAIR 
The rather large chambers from Room A88 to A93 
were used as everything from living quarters to 
prison dens to workshops. Although the humanoids 
freely explored these areas, they were considered 
too large by either side to defend properly and were 
generally left alone.
The presence of a community is still obvious. The 
accumulated debris of years of occupation litters the 
floor (disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in 
these Rooms), and the sharp eye can make out non-
sense graffiti. 
Currently these Rooms are proving an attractive site 
to a large swarm of fiendish darkmantles; the flying 
beasts find the open spaces a pleasure to be in. Each 
member has selected an area and only leaves it to go 
hunting in the dungeon.
If any of the orcs from Room A81 are with the PCs, 
they are all too familiar with the area, having retreat-
ed through. They gladly and ferociously attack any 
fiendish darkmantles they encounter. 
A88 . LAIR ENTRANCE 
Both doors to this Room are open. 
The floor of this large room is covered with debris, 
and settled dust coats everything. Three hulking 
shapes can be seen in the darkness on the other 
side of the room.
Should the PCs take their eyes off the beasts in this 
Room, they notice:
Footprints cut through the dirty floor, indicating 
someone was here recently. Someone without 
shoes. They came in from the south and exited 
through the door in the north. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Three fiendish axe beaks currently occupy 
this Room. They entered through the opposite door 
from the PCs a few moments ago. In addition to 
the axe beaks, include any creatures that may have 
retreated from Rooms A89 and A90.
Once the PCs move further into the Room, they 
notice a couple of orc corpses lying against the op-
posite wall. They would have been food for the axe 
beaks, but now they have the PCs to contend with.
Encounter Condition: Concealment
Tactics: The fiendish axe beaks are in an uneasy truce 
with each other and keep a wary eye out. Because of 
this, they do not work as a team and roll initiative 
separately. 
Although aggressive, these fiendish ax beaks do 
not fight to the death. There are two exits, so it is 
easy for one to make an escape if/when reduced to 
half hit points. They do not respond to the sounds 
of combat in Room A89 or Room A90, but should 
they retreat into Room A89, they join the fiendish 
forces there.
If the PCs retreat, the fiendish ax beaks do 
not follow.
If the PCs attempt to close the doors in this 
Room, the fiendish ax beaks are quite capable of 
opening them again. 
Treasure: A DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
reveals a tattered sack wedged into a corner of 
the Room and covered with dirt. It is filled with 23 
small polished gems, each worth about 5 to 10 gp 
each. They are the treasure of a kobold who hid 
them from the rest of the humanoids, but he never 
returned for them.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two fiendish darkmantles waiting to drop on 
wounded PCs. To decrease the challenge of this 
encounter, remove one fiendish ax beak.
A89 . ANCILLARY LAIR 
Both doors to this Room are open.
The floor of this large room is covered with dust 
and debris. Dead flying octopi litter the floor. A 
trio of wild boars feed on the carcass, treating it 
like a toy. Other large pieces of meat are scattered 
around the room. Two large rats feed on something 
in the corner.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Three fiendish wild boars and two 
fiendish dire rats make their home here. They have 
made their way down from Room A103, killing and 
replacing darkmantles as they go, and now feed 
on the dead.

91
Rotting, dismembered orc corpses and dead 
fiendish darkmantles indicate there was a fight 
here. And either the boars were in on the fight, or 
they are enjoying the leftovers.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Cover
Tactics: No one is looking for a fight. They have 
plenty to eat, but all of the fiendish wild boars take 
a defensive stance when the PCs enter. The plans of 
the dire rats are not immediately known. They wait 
to respond to the PC’s actions. Anything overtly ag-
gressive sends the fiendish dire rats to the opposite 
doorway, joining forces with whoever is in Room 
A88 or Room A89.
The wild boars charge on the first round of com-
bat, gaining an advantage on their attack and 
damage rolls.
Treasure: Searching through the decaying orc corps-
es, the PCs find 15 sp, a whetstone, four hatchets, 
and a preserved plum in a dirty sack. It is unclear 
how the plum has not rotted yet. Is it magical?
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one additional fiendish wild boar and have 
them fight aggressively. To decrease the challenge 
of this encounter, remove the dire rats.
A90 . LARGER HORRORS 
Both doors to this Room are open. 
Debris and dust cover this abandoned room. Some 
furniture or crates were here once. It is unclear. All 
of the wood has been smashed beyond recognition. 
Four wolves with black fur tug and pull at the 
remains of a recently deceased kobold. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: In addition to the wolves, include any 
creatures that may have retreated from Rooms 
A88 and A89. 
Three fiendish darkmantles and dire rats are 
dead on the ground, obviously killed a while ago. 
But the kobold’s body is fresh, and the wolves 
want that.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Though playing tug of war with the kobold 
corpse, these fiendish wolves work as a team in 
battle, circling around a single enemy if they can. 
They are not timid and are unlikely to run. They 
gain advantage on any fear-based saving throw 
and work with any creatures that retreated into 
this Room.
The largest wolf performs a special trip attack on 
the second round of combat, attempting to get the 
largest PC on the ground. This is a special grapple 
requiring a contested Strength check, which the 
fiendish wolf gets a +3 on. If successful, the PC falls 
prone, and another wolf can attack him.
If the trip attempt fails, the wolf does not 
try it again.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two additional fiendish wolves who perform 
the special trip attack on round one at advantage. 
To reduce the challenge of this encounter, remove 
one wolf and/or have retreating creatures continue 
through the north exit.

 92
A91 . THE STRONG SURVIVE 
All of the doors to this Room are open.
This is a complicated encounter with numerous 
creatures. Some retreating creatures may have made 
it here. GMs may want to scale this encounter back, 
regardless, or suffer numerous character deaths.
This is an extremely large chamber. Although debris 
covers the floor, several areas of higher traffic are 
visible from the numerous doors that lead in and 
out of this room. Numerous shapes can be seen 
through the haze of the room, the smell unmistak-
able and fiendish.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This is the largest and most centrally 
located Room in this part of the dungeon. Accord-
ingly, numerous fiendish creatures are here, trying 
to get their bearings, having just come through the 
gateway in Room A103.
Orc and kobold bodies litter the floor, along with 
numerous darkmantles, rats, stirges, and an out-of-
place goblin who stumbled in here from Region B.
Slightly bewildered, several fiendish creatures 
are here. One fiendish owl bear, two fiendish ax 
beaks, three fiendish wild boars, three fiendish 
darkmantles, three fiendish stirges, and four 
fiendish dire rats present, in addition to any re-
treating creatures.
The darkmantles and stirges hide in the ceiling 
rafters above, waiting for their opportunity. A DC 15 
Wisdom check is required to spot them.
Encounter Condition: Concealment
Tactics: The PCs cannot possibly surprise the crea-
tures in this Room if they fought in Room A90 
beforehand. Retreating monsters will alert them of 
combat. However, they are still confused and fight 
at disadvantage on the first round.
The fiendish owl bear is already wounded and 
covered in blood. It stands in the center of the 
Room, surveying who or what to attack first/next. 
The fiendish ax beaks keep their distance from the 
owlbear, keeping their eyes on the entering PCs. 
The two fiendish wild boars are already feeding on 
carcasses alongside the fiendish dire rats.
The fiendish darkmantles are wounded from 
a previous fight and wait on the ceiling for an 
opportunity to feed. The fiendish stirges, while not 
wounded, are hungry and waiting for their moment 
to strike. These two creatures are the most likely to 
retreat north or west if things get too hairy.
Because of the scale of this encounter, it is 
broken down round by round, assuming specific 
creatures are alive that long. All creature types roll 
initiative separately.
On round one, the owl bear attacks a nearby 
wild boar. The ax beaks close the gap with the PCs 
but do not attack. The boars charge the first PC, 
attempting to take them down. The dire rats retreat 
to a safe corner and wait.
On round two, the owl bear turns its attention 
to the PCs, charging into the fray as if someone has 
used magic on it. The ax beaks attack whoever is 
closest while the wild boars push through the party. 
If a PC has been separated and exposed, one of the 
darkmantles and two of the stirges attack. At the 
end of the round, one of the darkmantles bathes 
the room in darkness, regardless.
In round three, the owl bear fights the closest 
thing it can find. The same goes for the ax beaks 
and boars. All of the darkmantles descend on who-
ever is weakest. The stirges do not hesitate to mob 
a single PC.
On round four, whoever is left standing contin-
ues to fight.
On round five, monsters start to retreat. Anyone 
with less than half hit points makes a run for it. 
They most likely head west, but the dire rats know 
of the food in Room A92 and retreat there. If any 
PCs have fallen, the boars and rats are the first to 
feed on their bodies. The stirges want fresh blood.
Treasure: There is likely to be some coinage among 
the dead bodies but little else of value. The gob-
lin wears a necklace with a key-shaped pendant 
on it. It is unclear what it goes to, but nothing in 
this Region.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two more fiendish dire rats. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, remove all of the fiend-
ish stirges.

93
A92 . NOWHERE TO HIDE
The door to this Room is open. 
The floor of this L-shaped room is covered with 
the usual debris, including bone, blood, and broken 
weapons. The number of dead bodies indicates this 
was a final holdout for the orcs, who took many 
creatures with them.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was the final holdout against 
the fiendish creatures. Whatever remained of the 
orcs died here, their bodies chewed on by their ene-
mies. If the fight in A91 becomes too much, the PCs 
or the fiendish creatures may fall back here.
One of the dead orcs died of disease and 
shows no sign of battle wounds. His gear remains 
untouched, though perhaps still affected by the 
black mold.

A93 . ANNEX
The door to this Room is open. 
The melted body of two flying octopus creatures 
lie in the doorway. They are splayed open and still 
warm, as though the fight just happened. Beyond, 
the area appears to have been a ready room. Bro-
ken arrows, spear tips, discarded swords, and the 
like lay scattered across the dirty floor. The smell of 
dank air and sweat lingers as though the room is 
still crowded with orcs and other humanoids.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Boyikt (Room A34) killed these fiendish 
darkmantles with a flaming sphere during a costly 
battle before he retreated north. The rest of the bro-
ken weapons were part of Longtail’s mustering of 
forces before marching on the chapel. These events 
did not happen at the same time.
The Room is filled with a number of potential 
storylines, including a troglodyte who is still in 
hiding or a lost kobold who doesn’t want to fight 
anymore. The details are left to the GM’s discretion.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The Room is a great place for illusions, bad 
memories, and more fiendish creatures to explore. 
Keep the PCs guessing.
Treasure: A thick lump of unprocessed copper ore lies 
wedged into a corner next to a small shovel. It looks 
as though someone was trying to chip away the 
copper from the rock to no avail.
Scaling: N/A
A94 . ISOLATED ROOM 
The door to this Room is closed. Bright light shines 
from under the door.
As you open the door, the sound of silence reso-
nates. The Room is ablaze with a bright light that 
seems to come from nowhere. Your lids cannot 
bear the light, and you squint to almost blindness 
to shield your eyes. Blurry figures form inside the 
room. They wave their arms? Legs? It is hard to 
discern what is happening.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This Room was used as an isolation 
chamber. The sound dampening and bright magical 
light were seen as methods of punishment. While 
sound does travel through the Room, it is slow and 
never louder than 40 or 50 dB.
Once the PCs’ vision clears up, they can see 
a tense standoff between the three figures: two 
kobolds and an orc stare at one another, no one 
daring to move. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The humanoids are ready to throw down but 
turn their attention to the PCs, who may or may 
not be a threat. If the PCs start a fight, the orc and 
kobolds join forces against the party. Otherwise, the 
humanoids do not strike first.
If a fight does break out, everyone attacks at 
–2 penalty, plus any sunlight penalty their spe-
cies suffers.
There is an opportunity to talk things out, how-
ever. And while the orcs and kobolds will not join 
the PCs, they are happy to talk things out rather 
than fight. They are just so damned tired.
Treasure: N/A

 94
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one more orc and one more kobold. To de-
crease the challenge of the encounter, have the orc 
standing over the bloody bodies of the kobolds.
A95 . THE LONG ROOM 
The door to this Room is closed.
This long room appears quite empty except for the 
lone chest at the far wall and a single orc corpse 
lying next to it. The smell indicates the orc has been 
dead for some time. Something has chewed away 
at the bottom of his boots and feet. Along the back 
wall is a freshly painted mosaic in a crude style. It 
shows a town on fire with numerous little people 
running around.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: While the door is perfectly safe, and the 
chest is too, the ceiling above the chest is not. The 
actual trap is a scorching ray trap that activates the 
moment a Tiny or larger creature approaches within 
5 ft. of the chest.
 '
Scorching Ray Trap. Three rays of flame attack up to 
three targets within 10 ft. +6 to hit, 2d6 damage per 
ray. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) to notice, DC 20 
Intelligence (Arcana) to disarm. Automatically resets 
after 10 minutes.
Encounter Condition: Fog 10
Tactics: If any humanoids are with the PCs, they have 
heard of the long Room with the lone chest. While 
they don’t know the chest is empty, they can, if they 
choose, warn the PCs of the trap.
Treasure: The chest is unlocked and empty. A thor-
ough search reveals a false bottom filled with nu-
merous gold and silver coins from a dozen different 
empires. There are over 100 gp worth of coins, but 
they are worth even more to a collector.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of the trap, add an-
other ray to each triggering of the trap. To decrease 
the challenge of the trap, change the scorching ray 
to a burning hands trap.
A96 . LIGHT AND LIZARDFOLK 
The door to this Room is closed and warded with 
a fire trap. It was placed on the door by Slissth, the 
lizardfolk druid, and triggers the moment someone 
opens the door. The trap is designed to alert the 
lizardfolk and give them time to prepare for intruders 
rather than kill anyone. 
 '
Fire Trap Deals 3d6 fire damage in a 5-foot radius. 
Creatures take half damage on a successful DC 10 
Dexterity saving throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
to disarm.
Read the following text once the PCs open the door.
Something scrapes across the ground as you push 
open the door. To your surprise, you see light within 
this room, not the flickering light of a torch but 
a solid, steady light. And the ominous sound of 
something moving...
If the lizardfolk have had time to prepare, read the 
following.
A hot, fiery green sphere lights up in front of you, 
catching some of you ablaze.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent 
Encounter: The reason for the scraping noise is a 
couple of rocks that have been wedged against the 
door for precisely this purpose. The rocks slow the 
opening of the door (it takes one full round to open 
the door after the discharge of the fire trap), and 
they also provide a warning to the room’s occupants 
in case the fire trap is somehow bypassed. 
The two lizardfolk are the guides that led Long-
tail’s expedition to this dungeon. They rest here 
while weighing their options. Although they resist-
ed entering the dungeon, they were forced to do so 
when the fiendish wererat refused payment. Once 
inside, they were trapped like all the rest.
The duo initially kept to themselves, living on 
the fringe of the reptilian settlement as the other 
humanoids explored the place. When the conflict 
broke out between the troglodytes and orcs, the 
lizardfolk sided with the troglodytes out of necessi-
ty. However, they were of limited use given their re-
liance on light and were fortunate not to be killed. 
With the appearance of the beasts, the duo sought 
their escape from this Region as quickly as possible 
and recently made their way here.
Both lizardfolk wear continual flame pendants, 
which are the lizardfolk’s most vital possession. 

95
Without them, they would be unable to navigate 
their way through the dungeon.
Encounter Condition: Soft Cover
Tactics: Both Kalhiss and Slissth are sitting across 
from the doorway, and as soon as they hear sounds 
in the hall, they prepare themselves. The odds of 
hearing anything beyond the closed door are slim 
(disadvantage to the lizardfolks’ Perception checks 
due to the door and distance), but they definitely 
hear the discharge of the fire trap (unless it was 
disarmed).
If time permits, Kalhiss readies his bow and 
holds an action triggered by the first creature that 
comes through the door while Slissth casts flaming 
sphere (green-colored) and rolls it toward the door-
way. Slissth stops the flaming sphere in the doorway, 
forcing any creature trying to move into the Room 
to get past it while Kalhiss fires arrows at any crea-
ture that tries.
After, Slissth prepares to cast green flame blade 
and moves to deal with any creatures that survive 
the flames and Kalhiss’ arrows, leaving the flaming 
sphere in the doorway. Slissth’s animal companion, 
a medium viper (T’lakiss), coils around Slissth’s 
shoulders. It defends the druid by biting any crea-
ture that engages in melee with the druid.
Once the lizardfolk recognize that it is the PCs 
and not some humanoids or obviously bestial 
denizen of the dungeon that opened the door, 
they hesitate a moment in their attacks. They call 
out to stop, but the PCs may not hear them over 
the clamor.
If the PCs attack, the lizardfolk defend them-
selves to the death if need be. If the PCs also 
halt their actions and request a parley or other-
wise stand down, the lizardfolk are willing to talk 
(Slissth keeps the flaming sphere in the doorway, 
just in case).
The lizardfolk know that their chances of sur-
viving in a dungeon environment are slim at best, 
and the appearance of the PCs gives them greater 
hope. They are willing to forge an alliance, assum-
ing that the PCs prove themselves trustworthy. You 
can use a Charisma (Persuasion) check based on 
the lizardfolk attitude of indifferent (DC 13) if you 
don’t want to roleplay the exchange. Give the check 
disadvantage if there are other humanoids with the 
PCs. Even if the result of the check is a failure, the 
lizardfolk still ally themselves with the PCs, though 
cautiously. 
The lizardfolk are the most reliable allies the PCs 
can find in this Region. They kept themselves out 
of the fray and thus have made no enemies among 
any of the humanoids. Furthermore, they judge 
their allies on what they do, not what they say or 
who they are. The more the PCs help the lizardfolk, 
the more they help the PCs.
The lizardfolk are intelligent enough to realize 
that if the PCs are traveling with orcs or kobolds, it 
is out of necessity and not because they share the 
same outlook on life. Thus, it is quite possible that 
if and when the other humanoids turn on the PCs, 
the lizardfolk will stand by their new allies.
Because these two kept their distance from the 
other humanoids, they know little about the in-
ner workings of the other humanoid groups. They 
can tell about the journey to the dungeon but are 
unaware of the exact purpose that Longtail had in 
coming to the dungeon. They both suspect that it 
was he who released the extraplanar beasts. They 
cannot pinpoint the wererat’s location because they 
have not seen him, but Kalhiss knows that all the 
creatures have come from the northeast.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase Kalhiss’ and Slissth‘s levels by one or two. 
To decrease the challenge of this encounter, de-
crease Kalhiss’ and Slissth‘s levels by one or two.
A97 . TREASURE VAULT
The door to this Room is open and the doorway is 
trapped with a hypnotic trap and a burning hands 
trap, which trigger in succession. The traps trigger 
the moment any creature of Tiny size or larger enters 
the doorway.
 '
Hypnotic Trap. Creatures within 15 ft. of the doorway 
must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or 
be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed by this 
effect, the creature is convinced there is nothing 
worthwhile in the room and no reason to enter 
it. Indeed, they actively persuade other creatures 
to leave the place alone, claiming a vision of hid-
eous monsters inside, waiting to consume any 
who enter.

 96
 '
Burning Hands Trap. 3d6 fire damage. Creatures take 
half damage on a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving 
throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, 
DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. Auto-
matically resets after 1 round. Note. A PC charmed 
by the hypnotism trap cannot save against this 
fire damage. 
A couple of broken crates are all that remain of 
interest in this otherwise empty room.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was a minor treasure vault. While 
not one of the great repositories of wealth within 
the dungeon, it still contains a considerable sum 
of money. The effectiveness of the hypnotic trap 
means none of the region’s inheritors ever made 
it inside. Quite the opposite, in fact; if there are 
any humanoid inhabitants of the dungeon with 
the characters, they say they’ve heard of this room 
before–of its horrifying reputation... no one, they 
say, has ever entered and returned alive. The fact is, 
none ever entered in the first place, but the story 
has grown in the telling.
Encounter Condition: Negative Energy
Tactics: Roll for a random encounter once the trap 
has been triggered. If creature(s) are rolled, they are 
stuck inside the Room, unwilling to risk the trap 
again. They cannot be surprised and are ready to 
fight once the traps have been sprung.
Treasure: 4000 gp in a number of chests, along with 
eight small rubies (5 gp each) and a signet ring 
bearing the crest of the dungeon’s original creators 
(worth 200 gp to the right antiquarian).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the traps affect two PCs. To decrease the 
challenge of the encounter, remove the Burning 
Hands trap.
A98 . FORGOTTEN TORTURE 
CHAMBER
The door to this Room is closed and trapped. The 
doorway is trapped with a hold person trap and a 
burning hands trap, which trigger in succession. The 
traps trigger the moment any Tiny or larger crea-
ture enters the doorway. It only affects the creature 
in the door.
If there are any dungeon denizens (kobolds, orcs, etc.) 
with the PCs, they do not know the exact nature of 
the trap. They do know that there are a lot of traps in 
this area — a fact they may or may not share with the 
PCs. Turag (Room A28), for instance, may decide to let 
the PCs walk into a trap without giving a warning.
 '
Hold Person Trap. An affected target must succeed 
on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed 
for 1 minute. Trap resets after 1 minute.
 '
Burning Hands Trap. 3d6 fire damage. Creatures take 
half damage on a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving 
throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, 
DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. Auto-
matically resets after 1 round. Note. A PC paralyzed 
by the hold person trap cannot save against this 
fire damage. 
Several skeletons sit against the wall, the shackles 
that held them to their fate still on their wrists. A 
dead orc lies just beyond the trap, face down, his 
clothing singed and burned.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was used as a torture chamber 
and its shackled inhabitants were left there to die. 
The orc died at the hands of the trap and no other 
orcs followed him in.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The orc has a small pouch with six small 
stones. The stones are semi-magical, providing pure 
mana for spells. Each stone can substitute for any 
one magical component of any spell up to 3rd level. 
The orc also has a +1 dagger hidden in his boot.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the traps affect two PCs. To decrease 
the challenge of the encounter, give the orc a +1 
shield as well.
A99 . EMPTY VAULT 
The door to this Room is closed. 
A couple of broken crates lay about this barren 
room. An empty barrel is tipped over and nes-
tled inside a chipped groove in the stonework. A 
thin human sleeps against the southeast corner, 

97
wrapped in an old blanket. His eyes slowly open as 
you enter the room.
Initial Attitude: Varies 
Encounter: This was a minor storage vault. Although 
it was once trapped, the trap has since failed, and 
the door is perfectly safe.
A human (Nylinn) hides from the creatures 
in this Section. He was part of a larger group of 
adventurers who were attacked and killed by orcs 
and kobolds. He was able to survive and make it 
to safety.
He was unable to lock the door behind himself, 
as the door was damaged. Nylinn is cold, tired, 
and suffering from a nasty, untreated wound in his 
back. He initially hides this from the PCs, believing 
they might choose to leave him behind if he can’t 
take care of himself. 
Encounter Condition: Echoes 6, Safe
Tactics: Depending on the GM’s preferences and the 
needs of the game, Nylinn might be one of any 
number of people. 
 
Option 1) Nylinn is a friendly NPC with the 
potential to become a PC. If so, he has no char-
acter class until a player takes him on. He doesn’t 
know much about the dungeon and only came 
following rumors of treasure, though the fact 
other adventurers are searching for the gold or 
that the PCs’ employers sent other people down 
here might set up some intriguing complications 
further down the line.
 
Option 2) Nylinn is a 4th-level rogue and a rival 
NPC adventurer. This does not make him an 
enemy of the PCs outright. Their goals may align. 
He was hired by the church to retrieve a lost book 
of rituals stolen by Longtail. He’s made it this far 
into the dungeon because he is competent and 
quiet. He travels alone because it’s easy to infil-
trate that way. He is not aware that he is stuck 
in the dungeon, though, but he is aware of the 
various non-troglodyte factions in the Region. 
He does not know where Longtail is. He prom-
ises the PCs to stay out of their way and, if they 
seem amenable, offers information about Long-
tail (or something else of interest to the PCs) in 
exchange for healing. He might tell the PCs about 
the relationship between Longtail and Achsyyx or 
about the treasure in Room A97. He might prove 
a useful ally at some point later in the adventure if 
the PCs are struggling and the GM feels the need 
to help them out. 
 
Option 3) Nylinn is a 3rd-level human warlock. 
The cat from Room A59 is his. He wants his 
familiar back if the PCs have it. This could lead to 
a fight. If the PCs do not have the cat, he may or 
may not ever bring up his familiar, presuming it is 
dead. He offers to accompany the PCs for a share 
of the profits, both for himself and for his cat. He 
is endearingly haughty and much less intelligent 
than he believes himself to be.
Note: The humanoids and lizardfolk know who 
Nylinn is. If you go this route, be prepared for the 
consequences.
Unless the GM chooses for Nylinn to be Long-
tail, no stats are provided. GMs are welcome to 
come up with other reasons for Nylinn being here.
Treasure: Nylinn’s treasure varies, depending on 
which version of him the GM decides to include in 
the adventure.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give Nylinn a wolf as an animal companion in ad-
dition to his cat familiar. To decrease the challenge 
of this encounter, Nylinn does not wake up when 
the PCs enter. However, this only matters if the PCs 
choose to fight him.
This scaling is strange. It requires some fore-
thought on the GM’s part. Before the encounter 
commences, the GM will have to determine how 
powerful the PCs are compared to Nylinn. If a 
wolf companion is present, that will have to be 
described. Even if the PCs do not intend to fight 
Nylinn, it will still be necessary to gauge relative 
strengths.

 98
A100-A104 . THE CHAPEL 
Rooms A100 to A104 contain the long-forgotten 
chapel as well as some ancillary Rooms. The chap-
el was abandoned ages ago, and because this area 
is effectively isolated, the humanoids never both-
ered with it.
All of these encounters are fights. The GM should 
plan these encounters ahead and not just open the 
book the day the PCs encounter these Rooms.
Currently, Longtail and Achsyyx make the chapel 
their home. The wererat has isolated himself from 
the other factions, now a victim of his own ambi-
tions. The PCs most likely encounter them separately, 
though merciless GMs may have them fight the PCs 
together or, at the very least, come to the other’s aid 
(Rooms A101 and A103).
In addition, a fiendish owlbear is rampaging 
through the area completely out of control.
Random encounters do not occur in this Section.
A100 . PRISONER HOLDING CELL
The door to this Room has been smashed open. Be-
fore the PCs get too close, they can hear the sounds 
of combat and bestial shrieks from inside.
Note: This is a difficult and complicated encounter.
The door has been smashed open, lying broken and 
off its hinges. A mixture of splintered wood and 
twisted metal bands lie scattered in the doorway. 
Despite the gloom, it is possible to discern the 
carnage within.
A huge, feathered monstrosity with a raptor’s head 
utters horrid shrieks as it rampages through the 
room. Fresh blood sticks to its coat, and it carries a 
flying octopus clutched in one claw, entrails hang-
ing from its beak. At least half a dozen more flying 
octopi lie dead around it, their bodies torn open. 
Another, obviously heavily wounded, flies about the 
room in panic. Small empty force cages line the walls.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This is the latest creature to step through 
the ‘doorway’ opened by Longtail. Enraged beyond 
reason, the fiendish owlbear kills anything in its 
path. The darkmantles had the misfortune to be 
resting here when the fiendish owlbear emerged.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The fiendish owlbear is enraptured by its 
bloodlust and is enjoying the destruction of the 
much weaker fiendish creatures, much as it enjoyed 
the killing of the humanoids in Rooms A101 and 
A102. It is momentarily distracted by its quest for 
the last remaining fiendish creatures and does not 
immediately notice the PCs. This is compounded 
by the low light within the room. At the start of the 
encounter, the fiendish owlbear has disadvantage 
on all Perception checks related to sight, unless the 
PCs possess a light source.
Once it spots the PCs, it attacks the nearest, 
swatting with its claws and biting with its beak. Due 
to its damage reduction, it has not been seriously 
hurt or challenged and thinks nothing of the insig-
nificant creatures that come into its field of vision.
Despite its evident rage, the fiendish owlbear 
is not stupid. If an opponent manages to deal 10 
or more damage in a single turn (after applying 
resistances), the fiendish owlbear turns its atten-
tion solely toward that individual and can pursue it 
without drawing attacks of opportunity. In any case, 
once hurt, it focuses its efforts solely on those who 
have hurt it and ignores those who haven’t. Fur-
thermore, if reduced to one-half of its hit points or 
fewer, it attempts to escape, bull-rushing and oth-
erwise fighting its way out of the Room and down 
the hall; it only fights to the death as a last resort.
The moment the fiendish owlbear is distract-
ed, the remaining fiendish darkmantle flees as 
best it can.  
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the fiendish owlbear’s hp to 92. To decrease 

99
the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish 
owlbear already injured at the hands of Longtail 
(see Room A104). It starts instead with 57 hit points.
A101 . HIDEOUT 
As the PCs approach this Room, from either direc-
tion, read the following.
Nearly a dozen orc and kobold bodies lie strewn 
across the hallway, vicious slash marks on their 
bodies. Three dead orcs are pressed against the 
iron-bound door as if trying to get in.
The door to this Room is locked and barred from 
the inside. Longtail has sealed himself inside and 
left the others to deal with the owlbear. A DC 20 
Strength check is required to bash it in. Unlocking 
it requires a DC10 Dexterity (Sleight-of-Hand) check 
but does nothing.
The PCs may bypass this Room because they cannot 
get in. There is nothing wrong with this. Longtail can 
be a long-term problem for Region B and Region 
E. But as the PCs advance in level, the GM needs to 
advance Longtail’s stats as well.
A large, surprisingly clean chamber confronts you. 
A pile of empty crates and barrels are clumsily 
stacked in the center of the room, swaying slightly. 
The room’s only occupant stands behind the tower 
— a single wererat staring you down in a defensive 
posture. He looks angry, like someone having a very 
bad day. You suddenly feel sleepy...
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The orcs and kobolds were part of the 
small expedition that Longtail led to search for the 
chapel. They were killed by the owlbear when told to 
hold the door. Longtail is desperate now, not know-
ing who the PCs are or why they’ve come, but being 
generally paranoid, he initially assumes they’re here 
to assassinate him.
Longtail has stacked some empty barrels and 
some broken-down crates in the center of the Room 
to use as cover. It is haphazard and makeshift, but it’ll 
do the trick in a pinch.
A number of things are about to happen as the 
PCs enter the Room. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: There is virtually no way for Longtail to 
be surprised by the PCs. He moves to confront 
them as soon as he is properly prepared. Either 
he heard them coming in, or Achsyyx has already 
warned him.
The wererat is already in hybrid form and stays 
that way throughout the encounter. If Longtail is 
disguised as Nylinn and traveling with the PCs, this 
is his opportunity to escape to Room A104.
The moment he hears the PCs bashing on the 
door, Longtail dons his goggles of night before 
casting expeditious retreat and guidance on himself, 
then moving to either the left or right hall doorway, 
depending on which one the PCs are furthest from.
Once the door opens, Longtail casts sleep and 
attempts to snipe at the remaining PCs using magic 
missile or his wand. If there are too many enemies 
closing in on him, he uses his superior speed to 
evade or retreat to Room A102. If things get too 
tight, he can use fly and invisibility to buy himself 
some space.
Although Longtail opened the gateway, the dis-
appointing results have left him less than eager to 
fight for its possession. As long as things go his way 
in a fight, he is happy to duke it out. But if he is 
reduced to one-half or fewer hit points, he retreats.
He hides from the PCs within the dungeon, 
waiting for them to leave. If Achsyyx is still alive, he 
may join Longtail after the fight begins. However, If 
Longtail must, he leaves Achsyyx to make his own 
way. Only if escape is impossible, or he is about to 
die, does Longtail offer a truce, hoping to leave on 
his own terms. If even this prospect is dim, then he 
will beg for surrender.
If allowed to live and/or escape, Longtail heads 
north to Region E. He doesn’t know what is there. 
It’s just a random direction he’s headed in. Howev-
er, the parlay between Longtail and the PCs is likely 
to be lengthy and involve some negotiation.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give Longtail haste instead of fly and have invisibil-
ity already cast before the PCs arrive. In addition, 
add a fiendish rat swarm under his command. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, allow 
Longtail only two unused spell slots per level and 
reduce his hit point total by 20 (he has already had a 
run-in with the owlbear).

 100
A102 . HOLDOUT 
The door to this Room is open and shows signs 
of having been hammered against. If Longtail has 
retreated to this Room, he may close the door and try 
to lock it, taking an action to do so. If locked, the PCs 
can bash it open with a DC 14 Strength check or pick 
the lock with a DC 15 Dexterity check.
Large basins and tubs fill the room. Ritual glyphs 
and sigils line the walls. Several basins are cracked 
or broken open completely. One massive tub is 
raised and made of brass or bronze. Angelic heads 
are carved into all the bas-relief features. Water 
trickles, almost magically, from a font raised high 
against the south wall. It flows into each tub 
and basin. The excess water drains into cracks in 
the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: There is only an encounter here if Long-
tail has retreated.
This was a ritual bathing area. Symbols of pu-
rification are etched carefully into the walls. They 
have stood the test of time. Several deities names 
are also etched on the wall. Pick some from your 
home campaign.
A shelf in the southeast corner has rusted ritual 
daggers on it. The shelf above that has places for 
soap and brushes is now long gone.
Along the southern wall are holy, non-magical 
glyphs and pictographs showing the eight stages of 
ritual cleansing. None of them mention the dag-
gers, which begs the question. Why not?
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Longtail’s tactics remain the same. He at-
tempts to flee if he can. Otherwise, he tries to work 
an angle for peace. If that doesn’t work, he uses 
the broken basins and tubs as cover as he fights at 
a distance.
Treasure: Holy vestments hang on hooks throughout. 
They are covered in the same sigils as those on the 
walls and tubs. If worn, the vestments grant a +2 on

A103 . THE LONG-FORGOTTEN 
CHAPEL
The two doors along the southern wall are closed. 
When the PCs stand in the northern portion of the 
chapel, shrieking noises echo from the east.
The secret door to the west is a one-way secret door 
that can only be opened from inside Room A103. 
The door cannot be pulled open from the other side. 
Unlike standard secret doors, this door is hinged on 
one side and requires less effort to open via a DC 12 
Strength check. It is also fairly noticeable from the 
inside. When fully open, the door provides 4 feet 
of space, enough for a Medium creature in armor 
to pass through. The doors at the southern end 
are closed. 
Large plain pillars that reach to the ceiling sit 
every ten feet in this room. A swirling oblong 
vortex of black and red sits against the northern 
wall, pulsing with eldritch energy. A handful of the 
flying octopi lie on the floor, obviously charred and 
eviscerated.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This is the chapel that Longtail sought af-
ter. All adornments and decorations were removed 
when the chapel was abandoned and neglected 
by practitioners centuries ago. A few etchings on 
the wall indicate the place was once dedicated to 
a god of distance, of doorways, and of forgotten 
parents. The dead fiendish darkmantles were killed 
by Longtail.
The swirling vortex is the gateway to an extrad-
imensional pocket — a minor hell chiefly reserved 
for hunters and incompetent dungeoneers (hence 
the preponderance of vicious animals). Initially 
considered a minor nuisance, the fiendish beasts 
were kept trapped inside this Room. That pocket 
ruptured when the earthquake happened, and this 
part of the prison was abandoned.
It was Achsyyx who realized that a human hand 
was needed to dispel the magic on the grif-
fon-shaped lock that still held some magic on the 
gateway. Without Longtail, the fiendish creatures 
would have to wait hundreds more years. 
And Achsyyx had grown impatient.
As Longtail’s familiar, Achsyyx knew it could feed 
the wererat any lie that led to power. And gifting 

101
Longtail a ring the imp claimed to find, the evil, 
greedy tendencies of the wererat amplified. He 
sought out the chapel, thinking it was his idea, 
and used rituals found in his stolen tome. Once 
he opened the gateway, Longtail realized what 
he’d done. With the lock removed, the pocket was 
opened. And many of Longtail’s army died.
Achsyyx’s plans fell together so perfectly that 
Longtail still hasn’t realized he’s been duped. He 
still believes the imp is a victim in this as well.
Although the chapel appears empty when the 
PCs arrive, it is not. An invisible Achsyyx keeps an 
eye out on the gateway at all times. And unless the 
PCs can go undetected, the imp notes the PCs’ 
presence. It may or may not empathically commu-
nicate this to Longtail (GM’s choice).
However, neither Longtail nor Achsyyx knows 
who the PCs are. Or why they are here. A few ad-
venturers have stumbled into the prison lately. The 
PCs could be anyone. This is especially problematic 
if the GM is not using the Longtail storyline provid-
ed at the front.
Note: It is possible the PCs have already encoun-
tered Longtail. If so, Achsyyx may not be here but 
has joined the fight in Room A101.
Roughly twice a day, the holy magic that once 
flooded the chapel returns for a moment. An illu-
sion of what the Room once looked like super-im-
poses upon the chapel, giving the impression the 
vortex is gone and all of the pews remain. This is 
temporary, however. The chapel always returns to 
this present state.
The gateway itself is an opaque, swirling, less 
powerful (but permanent) version of the gate spell. 
It is strictly a doorway that only allows travel be-
tween the extradimensional pocket and cannot 
be used to call forth specific creatures. It is up to 
the GM whether the gateway allows travel in both 
directions (thus allowing the PCs to go into it) or 
whether it only allows one-way travel (suggested). 
Once opened, the gateway remains open until 
closed. Since each group of PCs’ abilities and re-
sources are different, a number of ways to close the 
gateway are listed below.
 
A successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana or Reli-
gion) check by a divine or arcane spellcaster can 
be used to close the gate. Each successful check 
reduces the gateway by one quarter (meaning 
that it takes four successful checks to fully close 
the gateway). This closure restricts the size of 
creatures that can come through the gateway. 
At its current fully open state, a creature of up 
to Large size can come through. Each reduction 
diminishes the size of the creature that can come 
through by one size category so that if the gate 
is 1/4 closed, a Medium or smaller creature can 
come through. ½ closed allows a small or smaller 
creature to come through. 3/4 closed allows a Tiny 
or smaller creature to come through. This same 
process can also be used to reopen the gateway, 
setting up a potential duel of Religion/Arcana 
checks between Longtail and/or Achsyyx against 
the PCs.
 
A successful casting of a dispel magic spell, accom-
panied by a successful DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana 
or Religion) check, closes the gateway completely 
and permanently.
 
Using the ritual book for any of these activities 
provides advantage to die rolls but increases cast-
ing time to 10 or 15 minutes.
 
If the PCs have already found the book (in Room 
A104), they may have had time to study and read 
about the gateway/pocket. Grant them one ad-
vantage to any two rolls made in relation to the 
gateway, especially if they specifically address this 
action. 
 
The passage of a creature of the Prime Material 
plane through the gateway forces it shut (but the 
creature is trapped within the pocket). A fiendish 
rat will not work, but a regular rat would.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Achsyyx is a coward at heart but a thrall to the 
powers inside the pocket. He keeps the gate open, 
even if it costs his life (as he fears the final creature 
inside). It prefers to have Longtail do any dirty work 
but only summons his master if the PCs seem over-
ly interested in the gate.
PCs dragging their feet too long in this room 
watch as a pair of fiendish ax beaks stumble out 
of the gate.
If the PCs have figured out how to close the 
gateway and begin doing so before Longtail arrives, 
Achsyyx interferes. Staying invisible, then swoop-
ing in to use his stinger, and then turning invisible 
again is his favorite tactic. If he deems it advanta-
geous, he also uses suggestion to distract one of 

 102
the PCs. Achsyyx certainly relays the information to 
Longtail, who arrives in due course.
Once Longtail joins the battle (see Room A104), 
Achsyyx keeps itself out of danger, using his powers 
at a distance or not at all. He concentrates on keep-
ing the gateway open rather than helping Longtail. 
If given a choice between the gateway and his mas-
ter, Achsyyx chooses the gateway every time.
Once the gateway is closed, it disappears from 
view. Whether it is permanently destroyed or just 
hiding invisibly once again is up to the GM.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have two fiendish ax beaks already outside of the 
gate, with two more arriving a minute later. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, Achsyyx’s 
invisibility does not work until Longtail arrives.
A104 . LONGTAIL'S  
PRIVATE ROOM 
The door to this Room is open.
The far wall is smeared with tar or black ink. It 
is difficult to tell at this distance. A small bedroll, 
some caltrops, a backpack, and a continual flame 
candle holder are the only furnishings in this 
otherwise cheerless room.
After the PCs enter the Room, read the following:
On the floor, a few books lay scattered, as though 
someone was deep in reading while also angry. 
Some of the books are torn. One is bound in 
leather, and one has black paint smeared across the 
open pages. It looks as though someone was living 
here, but not anymore.
Note: It is possible to find Longtail here, but it is 
highly unlikely. He has since moved to Room A101 
and Room A102 since the owlbear (Room A100) 
appeared. He is holding up there behind a locked 
door. If the PCs deal with the owlbear and never go 
to Room A101, Longtail eventually makes his way 
back here.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This is Longtail’s Room. The wererat 
spends most of his time here after almost being 
killed by fiendish creatures that swarmed out of the 
gateway. Longtail is, unsurprisingly, unhappy about 
the turn of events and searches for a way to control 
the beasts coming through the gate. So far, he has 
not found anything.
There are six books altogether, in various con-
ditions. One is torn apart. One is covered in dark-
mantle ink. One is covered in maddening scribbles. 
One is a book on medicine and pain (well-worn and 
well-read). One is Longtail’s spellbook (worn), the 
spells listed in his stat block. Finally, one is the book 
of rituals stolen from the church in the preamble.
The last book may help them find a solution to 
dealing with the gateway, should they take time 
to read it thoroughly and/or ask the GM the right 
questions while studying it.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There is a continual flame candle holder, a 
pair of hardy, human-sized work boots laid next to 
the bedroll, along with a paring knife. A small stack 
of books, as well as the ritual tome, lie against his 
bedroll. He carries his personal magic items.

A105-A113 . LOST ROOMS 
Rooms 105 through 113 are a series of Rooms that 
can only be reached from the main area by using one 
of three secret doors. Due to this fact, these Rooms 
escaped the attention of all its inhabitants and re-
main much as the original builders left them.
Currently, most of the Rooms are empty, although 
several of them still bear magical remnants of their 
former occupants’ flights to freedom. PCs face little 
danger here as there are few live monsters, and any 
potential pitfalls are quite obvious, but some traps are 
difficult to avoid.
Random encounters cannot occur in this Section of 
Region A. Use logic when determining if a Room in 
this Section is safe to rest in.
A105 . FORGOTTEN ROOM 
The door to this Room is locked and trapped. It 
is very clearly a trap, as PCs can see the runes, 
glyphs, and sigils emblazoned all over the 
door. The trap is not subtle. 
The lock is a massive padlock with 
chains, clearly holding something 
inside. Several bolts and latches 
hold the door closed on this side. 
It looks ancient and undisturbed.
Should any PC touch the door 
before disarming the magical trap, the 
door releases 2d6 fire damage and 2d6 light-
ning damage throughout the entire L-shaped 
hallway outside the Room. Dexterity save for half 
damage (DC 14). Once triggered, the trap does reset 
in 24 hours.
Disarming the trap requires a dispel magic or sim-
ilar spell.
Unlocking the lock is a simple DC 16 Dexterity 
check (Thieves’ Tools). If the check fails by more than 
5 (11 or less), the original trap is triggered (again), 
even if it has not reset yet. Opening the lock and un-
doing the latches takes time and makes noise. There 
is no way to surprise the occupants.
The demons, however, have still been unable to 
escape the Room. Seems unnecessary when phrased 
like this because, obviously, they are there. Despite 
escaping from the glass cube, the demons have been 
unable to bypass the cell’s other defensive measures 
until now.
Note: This is a complicated encounter. The inhabi-
tants cannot escape from the inside, but once the PCs 
open the 
door, 
they 
can mount an escape. 

 104
Read the following text once the door is opened.
As the door opens, the presence of evil is over-
whelming. A harsh red light seems to come from 
nowhere, bathing the room in vaguely evil shad-
ows. Heat clings to your exposed skin, and an acrid 
smell assaults your nostrils. 
The ceiling is extremely tall, and the floor is covered 
in broken glass. Three demonic beasts lurch around 
the room, pacing impatiently. They puff their chests 
and turn to face you as the door opens.
If you believe there is time for the PCs to notice, read 
the following text.
The hunched skeleton of something improbably 
large rests on a heavy stool against a stove furnace 
contraption at the corner. On the top of the stove 
are two short glass jars. One appears to hold 
something obscured and blurry. The other is filled 
with roiling blood.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This Room was once a prison cell for 
powerful demons, who still remain. But its purpose 
was long forgotten, even before the earthquakes. Its 
inhabitants have had a long time to foment hatred 
and plan their escape. They have no idea what exists 
beyond the door but still intend to escape, giv-
en a chance.
The heat is not hot enough to cause damage, 
but it is uncomfortable and results in exhaustion 
(level 1) at the end of round 4 of combat, which 
becomes exhaustion (level 2) after the fight is over.
Three dretches have been held captive here for 
centuries alongside a quasit (disguised as a bat 
hanging from the ceiling). There are also two jars 
holding two distinct creatures. See below. Everyone 
was once held inside a glass cube, but it has since 
broken open. The demons, however, have still been 
unable to escape the Room.
One of the dretches holds a unicorn horn in 
its hand. The other has a femur from a creature 
the PCs have never seen before. The last wears a 
brass collar.
If the unicorn horn breaks, the spell wither, 
and bloom is triggered, affecting everyone in the 
Room. The dretch knows this and may attempt to 
break it as a tactic. This requires a DC 18 Strength 
check, however.
The brass collar once had a hold monster spell 
placed on it. The magic has since faded. But some-
times, the collar shocks the dretch per the shocking 
grasp spell. See tactics.
The large skeleton is the remains of a guardian 
that died centuries ago. The original prison guards 
simply forgot about him, and the evil in this Room 
made the flesh wither off its body.
One of the jars contains a tiny but powerful de-
mon. The second jar contains sentient, evil blood. 
The demon can animate the skeleton and use it to 
get around, but is presently on top of the stove as 
a vantage point to survey the Room. The sentient 
blood (Gligg) is a complicated foe.
Both jars are indestructible while in this prison 
Room. Should the bottle demon in the first jar be 
carried out of the Room, it attempts to break itself 
out. The jar is still extremely resilient (AC20, 20 hp), 
and the demon, being unable to generate any mo-
mentum given that it fully occupying the jar, makes 
all its attacks at disadvantage. Nevertheless, if the 
characters simply stick the jar in a rucksack and 
forget about it, the GM should roll an attack every 
minute or so. It’s a great way to terrify the players 
at the table, and, should the demon break out, it 
might make the next stop for a short or long rest 
very entertaining. 
Gligg is another matter altogether. Even among 
the demons in this Room, Gligg is hated. It is an 
anomaly in the dungeon and in the fabric of reality 
itself, and its presence is a mystery. Where it came 
from and why it is imprisoned with demons is 
utterly obscure. A DC14 Wisdom (Insight) check re-
veals to the characters Gligg was kept here because 
it couldn’t otherwise be kept or destroyed. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The fight starts almost instantly. The pair of 
dretches have already released their fetid clouds, so 
the PCs must make saving throws as soon as the 
door opens.
The dretches roll initiative together. Everyone 
else rolls their own initiative. Gligg goes on a ‘1.’
On the first round, the dretches use the weap-
ons in their hands on the first round, bashing and 
stabbing with rage. They gain advantage on this 
opening attack and deal an additional +2 damage 
should they successfully hit. Meanwhile, while 

105
disguised as a bat, the quasit uses its scare ability 
on the first PC through the door.
With their actions in the second round, the 
dretches dogpile on a single opponent, using their 
multi-attack to subdue an enemy quickly. They push 
back the PCs if possible. They regenerate three hit 
points each if they have suffered any damage.
The quasit, however, goes invisible and does not 
become visible again. Instead, it waits for an op-
portunity to fly out of the Room and escape. If you 
handle the encounter properly, the PCs may have 
never noticed the quasit (bat).
At the start of round three, the large skeleton 
resting against the furnace animates and grabs 
the bottle demon jar from the top of the stove 
while simultaneously grabbing the stool to use as a 
bashing weapon. The dretches regenerate three hit 
points each if they are still alive. If the third dretch 
is still up, the shocking grasp spell triggers on its 
collar, dealing 3 points of damage. Gligg casts dark-
ness into the eyes of one of the PCs.
During round four, the skeleton faces off against 
the closest PC while the bottle demon casts death 
ward on the skeleton. If any of the dretches are still 
up, they flank (if possible) and continue attacking. 
Gligg casts guidence on the skeleton.
At the top of round five, the bottle demon casts 
haste on the skeleton and then magic missile on all 
subsequent rounds. Unless a PC gets within 5 feet 
of it, in which case the bottle demon uses its bottle 
throw ability. The skeleton pushes forward if it can. 
Gligg casts slow on the nearest PC.
After that, the fight continues normally if anyone 
is left standing. The bottle demon can cast magic 
missile two more times.
The skeleton is too large to get through the 
doorway. But its objective is to get the jar out of the 
Room. As soon as it can get to the doorway, or as 
close as possible, it tosses the jar over the heads of 
the PCs. From there, the invisible quasit can grab 
the jar and fly away (as a bat). The quasit remains 
invisible when it picks up the jar.
If the bottle demon gets out of the Room, Gligg 
turns on its cohorts, casting confusion and sleep on 
everyone (on alternating rounds).
It is possible, the PCs will try to draw the fight 
out of the Room. This is perfectly fine. The skeleton 
has no need/desire to escape, but the others do. 
If the PCs give the demons space to operate, the 
dretches work to get the bottle demon out (know-
ing it will come back from them, eventually).
Note: While in this Room, all of the enemies 
gain advantage on resistance rolls of any kind 
(saves, etc.). They have been here a long time. Their 
will is strong. Whatever good energy existed here 
has turned villainous.
After the fight is over, read the following.
The heat is unbearable. You take a moment to 
gather your senses and sit. Your shoulders ache, 
and your mind is overcome with thoughts of 
villainy. This room is evil. While there is probably 
much to explore here, the oppressiveness of the 
room is noticeable. Long breath. But there’s anoth-
er problem before you. What to do with this jar?
The bottle demon may or may not still be alive 
after the fight. If it died in the fight, so be it. There 
is nothing for the GM to track. However, if the 
bottle demon does survive, the PCs have a choice 
to make. Do they put it back in the Room or take it 
with them? The situation with Gligg is similar...
Gligg cannot be destroyed, but it can be rea-
soned with. It has no voice but communicates in 
Abyssal through telepathy. It can also speak its na-
tive tongue, which is some ancient language from 
before elves and giants. GMs are encouraged to 
make it something weird. Maybe Gligg is a primor-
dial githyanki. Gligg might learn common slowly, 
through association with the PCs.
Gligg is very intelligent but might pretend to 
be stupid while discerning who these adventurers 
are. It might help the PCs with its limited powers. 
If so, someone must carry the jar. It is beyond evil, 
so just holding it will, over time, corrupt the PC. 
Even if the PCs trade off duties, Gligg’s evil will 
slowly affect them all. It might also read the minds 
of the PCs and, slowly over time, feed their wants 
and needs, making things happen in one charac-
ter’s favor over the others. Turning people against 
one another is what he does best. Give Gligg any 
high-level enchantment spells you want it to have.
But his powers can prove useful. The GM is 
encouraged to mix up what Gligg can do from time 
to time. The PCs can’t see? Gligg casts continual 
flame on someone’s clothing. The PCs are being 
overwhelmed? Gligg casts mage armor and shield on 

 106
the person holding the jar. The first time he casts 
magic missile, only one comes out. The second time, 
maybe three. Gligg will certainly tempt the PCs to 
use his power more and more until he turns the 
power off at the worst moment.
The PCs will probably try to drink Gligg. Some 
of him, at least. He does not come apart that way. 
He is a near-solid and cannot be cut. Therefore, 
if consumed, Gligg can be a powerful poison or a 
strong elixir. Inside someone’s body, it is even more 
powerful. The jar no longer holds it and being eter-
nal, Gligg can just wait out the PC who drank it.
Alternatively, the PCs can just leave the jars here 
and lock the door on their way out.
If the quasit escapes, it makes its way through 
the dungeon invisibly, as best as it can. It will even-
tually find someone to ally with and help them re-
sist and/or escape. Because of the location of Room 
A105, it can either head to Region B (if the doors 
are open) or north to link up with surviving human-
oids. This is left open for the GM to coordinate.
Treasure: The skeleton wears a golden necklace with a 
thick chain and an amulet with a holy symbol on it, 
now tarnished and brown. The edges are rusted. It 
radiates powerful evil and abjuration magic. Treat 
it as +1 resistance, should a PC wear it, but the evil 
cannot be easily removed from the item. This may 
eventually lead to a curse and could be a future 
quest, should the PCs survive.
The shattered glass covering the floor can be 
used as a magical component in any kind of ban-
ishment or binding spell. It replaces the standard 
material components of that spell. The PCs can 
collect roughly two dozen ‘doses’ of the glass if they 
spend an hour gathering the glass into a container.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two more dretches. To decrease the challenge 
of the encounter, the skeleton animates starting 
on Round 4.
A106 . THUNDER CELL 
Drawn on the door to this Room is the Celestial rune 
for ‘thunder.’ A DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check is 
required to translate the rune. The door to this Room 
is locked, requiring a DC 18 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) 
check or an arcane spellcaster to touch the door with 
a lightning-based or wind-based spell. 
A blast of air expels from the room with force as 
the door opens, pushing you to the ground. The 
room contains a strange, elongated desk There is 
also a large bronze plate in the center of the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The rune on the floor is the same as the 
one on the door. If any lawful or good PC stands on 
the plate, thunder and a blast of air erupts from the 
floor (for 1 full minute), but it does not hurt. In-
stead, it cleanses the PC of all poisons, ability score 
damage, and heals 3d8+3 points of damage.
In addition, so long as the PC is lawful good 
character remains on the plate for the full min-
ute, he gains temporary (1d20 days) resistance to 
fire damage. 
If a chaotic or evil PC stands on the plate, he 
suffers 3d8+3 electrical damage and gains one level 
of exhaustion. If a PC is both chaotic AND evil, he 
suffers this damage twice. This is pure arcane elec-
tricity that bypasses electricity resistance but not 
spell resistance.
Chaotic good and lawful evil characters gain/lose 
nothing from this thunder. 
Encounter Condition: Fear 14, Hallowed 2, Safe
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Inside the desk are numerous drawers, 
doors, and cubby holes. The GM is encouraged to 
make the process of opening and sliding doors 
complicated, like an intricate puzzle box. This 
drawer slides open, and a button is revealed, which 
makes a previously locked drawer openable. You 
get the idea.
Five scrolls (all penned in different hands) are 
tucked away in different places. Each is written in 
a different language, giving wizards a project to 
decipher them all.
The scrolls contain the following spells:
 
magic weapon and nondetection
 
protection from good and evil, silence, and hold 
person
 
disguise self and phantom steed
 
protection from energy, invisibility, and levitate
 

the statues.

A107 . HOLDING PENS 
Small cells, barely large enough to fit a person 
comfortably, line the length of this room. Empty 
shackles hang from the wall, magically electrical 
energy crackling from them.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was once used to hold smaller 
and less troublesome demons and devils. Usually, 
demons and devils were forced to face each other, 
knowing their ideological differences would drive 
the two mad and make escape attempts less likely–
and if the creatures did manage to get free, they’d 
be more inclined to kill one another than break 
out of the prison. The shackles act as dimensional 
shackles with hold monster (DC 18) cast on them. 
Encounter Condition: Haunted, Negative 
Energy, Safe
Tactics: If the PCs want to remove the shackles from 
the wall, they must first succeed at a DC 18 Wisdom 
saving throw or be held per hold monster. Then, 
they must succeed at a DC 22 Strength (Athletics) 
check. If both are successful, one pair of shackles is 
ripped from the wall. Spell resistance does not work 
against these shackles.
PCs that remain in this Room for too long begin 
to feel the unnerving energy of the demons who 
spent centuries here. Their aura has permeated the 
rock and made the Room unlivable. PCs wishing 
to rest here get no sleep but avoid the rigors of 
the dungeon.
PCs that attempt to rest here are overcome with 
nightmarish visions of demon creatures being 
shackled and caged, tearing their own limbs off, 
or growing new mouths in order to bite out their 
own throats. Upon waking, characters suffer 1d4 
Wisdom damage and exhaustion (level 1) instead of 
gaining the benefit of rest. They also begin to sweat 
blood for the next 24 hours, making any interper-
sonal checks at disadvantage as a result. 
Feel free to describe the nightmares how-
ever you wish. Throw in some sweating blood, 
and so on.

A108 . COLD CELL 
Drawn on the door to this Room is the Celestial rune 
for ‘water.’ A DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check is 
required to translate the rune. The door to this Room 
is locked, requiring a DC 18 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) 
check or an arcane spellcaster to touch the door with 
a cold-based spell. 
A blast of cold air expels from the room as the door 
opens. The floor, recessed, holds water about 4 or 5 
feet deep. Ice has formed along the walls, and mist 
hangs just over the lip of the water.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The rune on the floor is the same as the 
one on the door. If any lawful or good PC stands on 
the plate, cold and ice erupts from the floor (for 1 
full minute), but it does not hurt. Instead, it cleans-
es the PC of all poisons, ability score damage, and 
heals 3d8+3 points of damage.
In addition, so long as the PC is lawful good and 
remains on the plate for the full minute, he gains 
temporary (1d20 days) resistance to cold damage. 
If a chaotic or evil PC stands on the plate, he 
suffers 3d8+3 electrical damage and gains one 
level of exhaustion. If a PC is both chaotic AND evil, 

 108
he suffers this damage twice. This is pure arcane 
cold that bypasses cold resistance but not spell 
resistance.
Chaotic good and lawful evil characters gain/lose 
nothing from this cold. 
Encounter Condition: Extreme Cold, Flooded
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs search the water, allow a DC 15 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to find pipes of 
haunting that have become waterlogged. Three 
castings of mending restore the pipes.
A109 . FOGGY ROOM 
A thick ankle-high gray fog covers the entire 
floor. Occasional bright flashes within the fog are 
followed by a crackling sound. Stone statues, three 
in all, stand at the corners, billowing fog from 
their agape mouths. The statues are unique, even 
in size, pose, and gender. Their faces permanently 
are etched in horror. A strange gurgling noise 
fills the air.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This fog is the result of magical, gurgling 
energies released from the broken mouths of three 
stoney victims, placed here and punished by the 
guardians. All of the statues were once evil humans 
from an ancient empire, now turned to stone. These 
three were cruel kings and queens, punished for 
their sins centuries ago.
 
King Huthor, who slew 1,000 of his own people 
as a display of his power. He is in the NW corner, 
facing the center of the room.
 
Queen Osilith who encouraged her king husband 
to do it. She is in the NE corner, her head twisted 
to face south.
 
Prince Ferric, ‘the Debauched,’ a scion of an 
ancient and now forgotten house who spent his 
entire fortune in the pursuit of ever greater highs, 
eventually beginning to poison the food and wa-
ter supplies of his people for the thrill of watching 
them sicken and die, never understanding why. 
He is in the Southwest corner. His body points 
toward the center of the room, but his head is 
twisted completely around, facing the corner.
The PCs may not see it from across the room, 
but scores of fiendish beetles pour from the eyes of 
the statues. When they fall into the fog, they scream 
in agony as they die and dissipate into more fog. It 
is an unending cycle.
The hands of the statues face outward or are 
upturned in unique poses. Etched into the stone 
of each statue are lash marks as though they had 
been whipped.
The fog covers the entire floor of the Room ex-
cept for the first square to the west of the doorway. 
The fog is perfectly stationary and does not spill out 
into the hallway. 
The bright flashes and crackling are the result of 
the electrical charge that the fog bears (if the GM 
wants to make it more obvious, have occasional 
arcs of electricity race across the top of the fog). Any 
creature moving through the fog takes 1 point of 
damage per round due to the electrical discharges 
(2 points of damage per round if wearing metal 
armor or otherwise carrying a lot of metal).
Those who cross the Room to examine the 
statues suffer damage along the way. There is 
nothing to be discerned by looking at them. They 
are ancient, elusive figures from a kingdom the PCs 
have never heard of. Touching a statue’s hand(s) is 
another story.
Each one imparts a story. The PC’s mind is 
flooded with images of past trauma, torture, and 
blood — both by the sinners and their victims. 
These three were certainly punished for their trans-
gressions. Once a hand is touched, it cannot be let 
go of for a full minute, as the pain transfers from 
the statue to the PC.  The damage, however, takes 
the form of knowledge.
Once the full minute is over, during which time 
the PC does not suffer electrical damage, the PC 
gains 1 point of Intelligence but loses one point of 
Charisma. Seeing this horror imparts knowledge 
but strains empathy. The PC is also exhausted (level 
2) by this experience.
Each PC can touch only one statue but may not want 
to after they see what it has done to another PC.
Tactics: Do not immediately tell the PC they have lost 
Charisma and gained Intelligence. Instead, wait 
until after their next long rest.
Clerics may attempt to absolve the sinners. 
This may require the expenditure of a spell, an 

109
appropriate channel divinity, or perhaps hit points. 
GMs are encouraged to make the cost match the 
story so far or the crimes committed by the individ-
uals depicted in the statues.
Encounter Condition: Fog 5, Poor Footing 2
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the fog by 1. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the damage of the fog to 1 or 2 
damage per two rounds.
A110 . FLOATING SPHERES
The southern door to this Room is locked, requiring a 
DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to open.
Dozens of fist-sized spheres of swirling color float 
gently within the room as if moved by an un-
felt breeze.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The spheres are actually the physical 
embodiment of a gateway akin to the one found in 
Room A103, formed over time as the wards be-
gan to fail.
The moment a living creature enters the Room, 
the colorful spheres begin to float toward the center 
of the Room. There, they combine with each other 
and make a larger sphere. It takes four rounds 
for the spheres to completely form together and 
create an open gateway with the same properties 
(including a means to shut it down) as the one 
in Room A103. On the fifth round, something 
comes through (a fiendish owlbear is suggested, 
but it could be a number of fiendish darkmantles, 
fiendish stirges, fiendish dire rats, or fiendish rat 
swarms; the decision is up to the GM).
The gateway requires the presence of a living 
creature to open completely, and if the PCs leave 
the Room before the gateway can fully form, then 
the spheres break apart and continue floating. Once 
opened, however, the gateway remains open until 
closed by the same method that can close the one 
in Room A103.
The moment a living creature enters the Room, 
the colorful spheres begin to float toward the center 
of the Room. There, they combine with each other 
and make a larger sphere. It takes four rounds 
for the spheres to completely form together and 
create an open gateway with the same properties 
(including a means to shut it down) as the one in 
Room A103. On the fifth round, something comes 
through. This pattern continues, with a new fiend-
ish creature emerging every five rounds. Roll on 
the following table to determine what steps from 
the portal.
D6eMergent creature
11d3 fiendish ax beaks
2Two fiendish giant bats
3One or two fiendish panthers
41d3+2 howling, fiendish wolves
5One or two fiendish wild boars
6
Roll again. If a six is rolled again, a fiendish 
owlbear, eyes gleaming red, feathers 
glinting black and silver, emerges from the 
gateway; otherwise, two fiendish snake 
swarms emerge
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
the spheres open the portal after only 3 rounds and 
continue forming regardless of whether the PCs 
remain in the Room or not; if the PCs leave before 
the gate is fully opened, it still opens, and the beast 
or beasts emerge and hunt the PCs. To decrease 
the challenge of this encounter, have the gateway 
disgorge only a single beast before the spheres of 
the gateway drift apart again. 
Scaling: N/A
A111 . TWO PILLARS
Two segmented, nondescript square pillars domi-
nate the area. Large blades jut from the pillars into 
the space between. Pieces of a thin, broken skeleton 
lie near the eastern one.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The skeleton has been cut into segments 
and is beyond identification. It is shorter and 
thinner than the average human, should the PCs 
investigate the remains. The skeleton belongs to 

 110
an unfortunate drow who was killed by the trap. In 
turn, the trap has failed to reset.
However, the left hand of the drow is intact. 
Whenever a PC steps on the stone floor, the fig-
ures of the hand move as though playing a lyre. 
Each step taken by the PCs is mirrored by a finger 
motion. A DC14 Intelligence (History) check allows 
a character to identify the tune as that of an old 
children’s song (nursery rhyme if your game world 
has those). Bards gain advantage on this check. 
PCs may realize the hand is magical or holds 
some value. If they don’t break or destroy it, some-
one may carry the hand in a sack, or a necklace, 
or wherever. So long as someone is in possession 
of the hand, it grants a +2 bonus to magic-based 
saving throws. But the hand will forever twitch and 
move. It is not strong and cannot hurt anyone, but 
it never stops moving. 
Each pillar reaches to the ceiling, and the 
segments are a foot apart and so, in turn, are the 
blades. Each side of the column has a full set of 
blades, so the only way past the blades is to squeeze 
between them or to try and clear a space by push-
ing the blades back into the spaces. The blades are 
not as sharp as they used to be and are a bit rusty, 
but gloves are recommended for this task.
Because of the mechanism of the trap, all of 
the blades move together. It is impossible to push 
only one blade at a time back into the column. 
A DC 20 Strength check is required to give 
enough force on a single blade to rearm the 
entire mechanism and bring all the blades 
back into their column. For each additional 
blade that has force applied to it, the Strength 
check is reduced by 2; up to four creatures can 
push on the blades at one time (one blade per 
column side).
Each creature must succeed at the appropriate 
Strength check to do their part, so if four are push-
ing, each must succeed at a DC 12 Strength check 
for the blades to be reset. Once reset, the trap can-
not be sprung again because its triggering mech-
anism (DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check) is 
broken. The characters could mend it with a DC14 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, in which case any 
creature triggering the trap suffers 4d8 slashing 
damage if they step between the pillars, depressing 
the pressure pad.
Encounter Condition: Spell Resistance
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: An inspection of the bones, now scattered 
in dangerous parts of the Room, reveals a bracelet 
next to what might be an arm bone. The bracelet 
is old, scuffed, and now dented. It may, however, 
still possess magic. A simple cantrip, like mending, 
restores this bracelet to its original power, which 
keeps the wearer warm while he sleeps.
Scaling: N/A 
A112 . GATEWAY TO FIRE 
Drawn on the eastern door to this Room is a Celestial 
rune. A DC 20 Arcana check by a lawful character (or 
those who speak celestial) is required to translate the 
rune. “Purge thy body and thoughts with holy flame.”
The door is not locked, but it is difficult to open. In-
side the door, piles of wood and furniture have been 
stacked up to prevent entry, but a DC 15 Strength 
check opens it. Some light can be seen from under 
the door crack.
The door on the north-
ern wall is locked 
on both sides, 
requiring a 
DC 18 

111
Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to open. Alternatively, 
an arcane spellcaster may open the door by casting a 
single fire-based spell. The spell does no damage; the 
door absorbs it all.
A blast of hot air expels from the room as the door 
opens. An unnatural light bathes the area. A small 
rune is written on a bronze plate in the center of 
the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The rune on the floor is the same as the 
one on the door. If any lawful or good PC stands on 
the plate, a gout of fire erupts from the floor (for 1 
full minute), but it does not burn. Instead, it cleans-
es the PC of all poisons, ability score damage, and 
heals 3d8+3 points of damage.
In addition, so long as the PC is lawful good and 
remains on the plate for the full minute, he gains 
temporary (1d20 days) resistance to fire damage. 
If a chaotic or evil PC stands on the plate, he 
suffers 3d8+3 fire damage and gains one level of 
exhaustion. If a PC is both chaotic AND evil, he suf-
fers this damage twice. This is pure arcane fire that 
bypasses fire resistance but not spell resistance.
Chaotic good and lawful evil characters gain/lose 
nothing from these fires.

A113 . PRISON VAULT ANTECHAM-
BER
All of the doors to this Room are locked from the 
inside. The doors to this Room require a DC 18 
Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to unlock or a DC 20 
Strength check to bash open.
This hallway seems to loop back on itself, leading 
to nowhere. Two doors in the south and one in the 
north are the only features here.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The hallway surrounds a prison vault 
(Room A114) that once held a number of middling 
fiends. The block exhibits no cracks, pores, or pit-
ting and is simply one piece of dark basalt. On the 
floor on the west side is a bronze plate cut into the 
shape of a crescent moon. The PCs may not imme-
diately notice it. GMs should decide if they can find 
it or just accidentally step on it.
The plate is a permanent, invisible dimension 
door that instantly transports anyone standing on 
it to Room A114. To his companions, the PC seems 
to have disappeared suddenly. The effect can be 
detected with detect magic, revealing an aura of 
moderate conjuration magic all about the floor.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To decrease the challenge of this encounter, 
the bronze plate only affects non-lawful or non-
good characters. Or both.
A114 . PRISON VAULT
Dead orcs litter the floor of this doorless room. 
However, no stench exists, and the bodies show no 
GLIGG
Gligg is anything the GM wants it to 
be. In my own headcanon, Gligg is the 
quintessence of multiple beings, created 
in a ritual to defend against some sort 
of threat. But, in time, it became worse 
than the threat it was designed to fight. 
Whatever that was.

 112
signs of decomposition. After a moment, you realize 
you are having trouble breathing.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The only way to reach this Room is to 
step on the invisible dimension door in Room A113. 
The same can be done from Room A114, but that 
assumes that one understands the process.
The dimension door effect can transport any 
creature from Room A113 to Room A114 and 
vice-versa, provided that the creature, once trans-
ported, steps back out of the space before stepping 
back in. That is, the moment a creature steps onto 
the dimension door in the hallway, they are trans-
ported to the bronze plate inside the vault. They 
cannot make use of the vault’s dimension door ef-
fect until they step out of the dimension door space 
and then step back in.
This should not really be a challenge for PCs as 
long as they do what comes naturally: explore their 
surroundings. As long as they inspect the walls 
or otherwise move off the dimension door space, 
they are free to use it again. But until they do, they 
are trapped. 
The inside of the vault is airtight, a fact that was 
not a problem for the extraplanar fiends it held, but 
is a problem for any PCs trapped in here. There is 
enough air for one Medium creature for 12 rounds.
Reduce the air supply appropriately for every 
additional creature (by one-half if another Medium 
creature is there, by one-quarter if a Small creature 
is there, and so on). Although the PCs should have 
no trouble finding their way back to Room A113, it 
is possible that they could die.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Dead orcs litter the floor. A DC 10 Inves-
tigation check reveals three silver daggers hidden 
among their gear. The orcs didn’t need Longtail 
knowing they had a backup plan.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
reduce the amount of air in the Room to 9 rounds. 
To decrease the challenge, allow the PCs to return 
to Room A113 1d3 rounds later if they don’t step off 
the bronze plate.
A115 . VAULT 
The door to this Room is open.
The floor of this room is a mess. Dozens of broken 
crates and busted barrels, their contents spilled 
on the floor, mixed with the moldy remnants of 
at least as many sacks to completely cover the 
floor. A blackened scorch mark in the middle of the 
room indicates a magical fire from a central point. 
The lingering smell of fire and mold hangs in the 
air, though it is unclear how long ago all of this 
destruction happened.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This vault served as a major storage area 
but like almost everything else in this portion of 
the dungeon, was abandoned. The destruction was 
caused by orcs, but it is unclear (upon inspection) if 
the damage was intentional or not. 
Whether by accident or by madness, an orc got 
a hold of a magical staff, and it exploded on him, 
killing him and another orc. They were incinerated 
by the magical fire, which also consumed the staff 
and all the moldy bags in the room.
From time to time, the voices of the dead orcs 
can be heard moaning and wailing through the 
cracks in the walls. Their ghosts lack the power to 
do anything, but their pain lingers through un-
easy sounds.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: If the PCs lock the door with a DC 13 Dexter-
ity (Thieves’ Tools) check, the Room is considered 
Safe, though smelly.

Unless the PCs have already dealt with the fiendish 
owlbear in Room A100, read the following.
Horrid shrieking echoes from the hallway to the 
north, followed by another awful sound like ani-
mals being ripped apart.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The rampaging owlbear in Room A100 is 
fighting and killing fiendish darkmantles. The PCs 

113
may recognize the noise from the darkmantles, but 
not the owlbears.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs do nothing, the owlbear will finish 
off the darkmantles in due course and perhaps start 
searching in this direction after 10 or 15 minutes.

need some action, this is a good place for a random 
encounter coming from both the south and west.

AFTERMATH OF REGION A
There are possibly many loose plot threads to this 
Region, should the PCs not deal with everything here.
 
If Orghar is not killed, his villainy spreads to 
Region B. He may or may not take more orcs 
and kobolds with him. They also may 
end up killing each other, leaving 
Orghar all alone in his quest to 
escape.
 
If the troglodytes are left alone, 
their wounded heal, and the 
group travels north to search for an 
escape. This probably ends in more 
deaths, but that’s the GM’s decision.
 
If Longtail and/or Achsyyx are not 
killed, they look for a way out. 
Achsyyx pretends he has no idea 
this would happen and returns 
to loyally serving Longtail. Do 
they trail the PCs or venture out 
on their own?
 
The chapel gateway has a 
limited number of prisoners 
inside it. Eventually, a few more 
owlbears escape and go looking 
for something to eat. 
 
Gligg and the bottle demon 
pose significant issues as well. 
Not to mention the quasits. If 
any escaped Room A105, they are 
free to roam Region A and then 
B or E. The long-term conse-
quences may be too much for the 
guardians of E who already struggle to reclaim 
the Region.
 
Let us not forget that there are two adventurers 
in Region A who might join the PCs or encounter 
them again. Do not overlook their use.
 
Or the lizardfolk. GMs have their hands full...

REGION B . 
A GOBLIN EMPIRE!
Designed unlike other prisons in this dungeon, 
Region B became known as “the laboratory” where 
celestials studied prisoners to research the nature 
of evil and understand how best to keep it in check. 
While many of the lawful good angels and archons 
frowned on this practice, the lawful neutral and 
chaotic good guardians were less reviled. In the end, 
the angels turned a blind eye to it, and allowed the 
“harmless” experiments to continue.
Like many areas in the dungeon, this Region is a 
maze of rooms and hallways. It remained unchanged 
over the centuries and even followed the chaos of the 
first earthquake. Though inhabitants fled when wards 
were dispelled, some occupants remain bloodthirsty. 
And while the Region did not change as drastically as 
others had, it did not escape unscathed.
The air is dry, dusty and unmoving, not unlike 
being in a tomb. PCs walking through these claus-
trophobic hallways hear strange echoes and moans 
everywhere, as drafts of hot and cold air cut through 
the corridors at irregular intervals. It is at 
once inhospitable and unnerving. Now home 
to three goblinoid races, as well as various 
wild beasts, the PCs have more to worry 
about than mere traps, spooky noises, and un-
explainable visions.
The inhabitants of the Region have added 
to the celestial’s magical traps with 
crude (but effective) traps of their own. 
Tripwire, scything blades, and pit traps 
make navigating this Region diffi-
cult for low-level PCs. All the while, clever 
goblinoids hunt the PCs at every turn. If there 
is one thing the Region is known for, it’s this 
flavor of chaos.
Before the Region’s newest visitors arrived, 
the dungeon contained a distorted hierarchy, 
where celestials guarded against potential 
escape from the demons inside and an-
gels stood vigilant against all manner of evil 
confined within. After the earthquake, all that 
changed. When the majority of rooms were 
emptied and the demons inside the remaining 
cells no longer had any hope of escape, the 
Region was abandoned. Many celestials lost 
their lives in the riots that erupted over the 
centuries that followed and the decision to seal 
Region N was made.
And while the angels looked away, creatures 
migrated to Region B, looking for a new home 
where order was as common as justice.

113
Goblinoids arrived en masse, digging through 
whatever hole they could find, following the derro 
and drow. However, the northernmost reaches of the 
dungeon had already been “claimed” and the crea-
tures were quickly pushed south. As the years went 
by, more and more goblins arrived and migration to 
Region B became easier.
Once they arrived, camps formed quickly and the 
goblins skirmished with the bugbears and the bug-
bears warred with the hobgoblins. They returned to 
their way of life and fights over territory became as 
common as goblin tribe name changes.
Hundreds of years of warfare lead to the goblinoids 
trading control like currency. No single force ever 
stayed in power for more than a generation (and to 
goblinoids that’s more like 8 years) and the condition 
of the Region is in a state of flux, no matter what the 
goblin king (Room B75) says.
For centuries, the bugbears have fought a two front 
war against the goblins and hobgoblins, never allying 
with either and always seeking to route the other 
races from the Region. Their strength and ferocity 
easily dominated the goblins in battle and forced the 
hobgoblins into a remote corner of the region. They 
learned to use the traps built by the celestials to their 
own advantage, often luring the less intelligent gob-
lins into them. Only the sheer numbers of goblins 
and the tactics employed by the hobgoblins prevent-
ed the bugbears from totally dominating the Region 
as the sole goblinoid race.
The hobgoblins, currently the smallest group of 
goblinoids in the dungeon, try in vain to assert con-
trol over the Region. Their tactics and strategies are 
sound, but with their number diminished they are 
never able to claim more than a scant portion of the 
Region. Once, they ruled the northeastern portion of 
the dungeon but their rule was cut short by the earth-
quake. The damage done to their domain was stag-
gering, and their ranks decimated as a result. They 
were forced back towards the center of the dungeon, 
where they have been trapped between the goblins 
and bugbears ever since.
The goblins, led by their king Sug’kt in recent years, 
are by far the most numerous race in the Region. 
Their sheer numbers have allowed them to hold their 
ground against the bugbears for centuries. Surpris-
ingly, they had few overt clashes with the hobgoblins. 
The bugbears were a large enough threat that the 
smaller contingent of hobgoblins often went unno-
ticed. Over the years a stalemate has emerged, and 
an uneasy status quo has evolved.
None of the races are content, however. Far from it.
Recently, a force like none before arrived to alter 
the landscape and bring new order to the Region. If 
you query the goblins, they tell you: a new god has 
arrived. A statue of his likeness lies to the east and is 
nothing less than awe-inspiring. The goblins at last 
have a champion to smite their oppressors.
So great is the power of this faith in Norendithas 
Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes, that 
the goblins splintered and even with the goblin king’s 
power, he was unable to unite the fractured tribe. 
Forming their own brand of culture, the goblins now 
pay homage to their great god, who graces them with 
power and terror, promising to rain justice down 
upon their enemies.

114
Upon hearing news of this new deity the goblin 
king became enraged. As his kingdom became en-
tranced with the concept of a goblin god, he sensed 
his power and influence slipping. A close advisor to 
the king suggested he embrace the new religion.
The king would have none of it.
With Sug’kt set against the new god, his advisors 
rose up and imprisoned him for heresy. The supersti-
tious guards led the goblin king away and the charis-
matic advisor, known as Argliss, assumed the throne, 
proclaiming himself king and the direct messenger of 
their god. In one fell swoop, he reunited the troubled 
people and forged a new religion, one that could be 
used to create whatever laws he chose, through the 
will of their new god. And while no one noticed, the 
new king systematically changed the entire goblin 
culture in a few brief strokes, bending them in the 
direction of his personal ideals.
Argliss, the new goblin king, was and still is a dop-
pelganger. He wandered into this Region less than 
a decade ago and was amused by the goblins. Able 
to hide his form, his brilliant mind made the dop-
pelganger stand out. Soon he became an advisor to 
the king, and when the opportunity to become more 
presented itself, he seized it. Despite his brilliant, 
tactical, and plotting mind, he cannot see all things at 
once and the truth of this “deity” is not what it seems.
In truth, this deity was nothing more than a way-
ward hunter, turned to stone by a cockatrice (Room 
C16). Frightened by this unfamiliar creature, the gob-
lin’s eyes went wide and he raised his arms over his 
head in a meager attempt to protect himself. It was in 
this pose that he was most unfortunately petrified by 
the cockatrice. Goblins that followed, misinterpreting 
the stone goblin’s fearful expression, concluded that 
a new and powerful goblin god was looking down on 
them, demanding their favor and devotion. How else 
could they explain this awkward statue?
While the majority of the goblins follow their new 
god and king, a sizeable minority have broken off 
and formed a resistance movement. They continued 
to follow their old religion and despise the new king 
for usurping the throne. They are not alone in their 
opposition to the new regime.
The bugbears found themselves on the receiving 
end of ferocious attacks and canny strategy soon 
after Argliss claimed the throne. The new goblin king 
has struck a pact with the hobgoblins that remain, 
and now they serve the goblin king as instructors, 
advisors, and enforcers. Using worgs and howlers as 
mounts, they’ve created a fast-attack unit like noth-
ing the goblins could even conceive of. With their 
new allies and tactics and their new god, the goblins 
have driven back the bugbears, asserting their con-
trol over the majority of the Region. Now the goblins 
under Argliss fight a two-front war for the first time 
in their history. The rebel goblins in the south and 
the bugbears in the north harass and chip away at 
Argliss’ empire bit by bit, using every bit of cunning 
and trickery at their disposal. For all their bravado 
however, the zealous goblins under Argliss are firmly 
in control of the Region.
Dominated by an iron fist, the goblin empire will 
not (and cannot) be opposed.

115
WHAT ELSE
But the Region isn’t all goblins and mad religions. In 
addition to the goblinoids, a number of other beasts 
call this Region home. Dire wolves, a few undead, and 
so many traps that the goblins cannot see straight.
More than a few ethereal marauders were trapped 
in this Region around the time of the earthquake. For 
the most part they make their home in the northeast-
ern section of the dungeon.
Whether brought in by the celestials to curtail the 
activities of the goblinoids, or simply here due to the 
aftermath of the earthquake, this Region is home to a 
number of blink dogs. They can be found throughout 
the dungeon, except for in the domain of the goblin 
king. Here they are hunted as vermin by the goblins. 
The blink dogs are mainly found in the northern and 
northeastern sections of the dungeon.
The most unique creature in the dungeon is the 
goblin king’s mount: a yeth hound. How it came to 
be trapped in this Region is unknown. Shortly after 
Argliss’ rise to power, it arrived and he immediately 
charged his hobgoblin taskmasters with capturing it 
and turning it into his personal mount.
While most of the traps were designed to contain 
and “hold” the inhabitants of the dungeon, some 
take the form of puzzles that the unwary must solve, 
lest they suffer at the celestials’ hands. And if that 
weren’t enough, Argliss has ordered more traps be 
made to secure his “kingdom".
Lastly, somewhere in the darkness, a halfling 
adventurer searches for a powerful artifact that has 
slipped through the goblin king’s grasp.
THE HALFLING
Found throughout the Region is a halfling adventurer 
named Bartleby.
It is very likely the PCs will encounter him long 
before they find Toom B28. If they do, this is the Ran-
dom Encounter text.
BARTLEBY
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Along with the goblinoids and other 
creatures that inhabit this dungeon, there is a 
solitary halfling named Bartleby. While the halfling 
normally is found in Room B28, he is by no means 
stationary. The PCs have a chance of encountering 
him anywhere in the dungeon.
How the halfling entered the dungeon is un-
known. He is in league with the goblin king and 
searches for a mysterious artifact of allegedly great 
power (see sidebar The Artifact). While the goblins 
know of the halfling, they don’t know much. Any at-
tempt to glean information from a captured goblin 
reveals that a halfling is in the dungeon and that 
they assist him if he is attacked. Otherwise, they are 
to leave him alone.
The halfling, Bartleby, is only concerned with his 
own well-being and his quest for the artifact. He is 
in league with the goblin king solely to garner the 
protection of the goblins. Once he finds his artifact 
he will leave the dungeon, presumably by the way 
he entered.
Encounter Condition: Ambush
Tactics: Bartleby fights as long as he needs to in or-
der to escape. He knows the dungeon very well and 
is confident he can lose any attackers as long as he 
can flee. If the PCs capture him, Bartleby becomes 
belligerent, hurling insults and curses at the PCs. 
He does not answer any questions and attempts to 
escape at the first possible opportunity.
Treasure: Aside from his possessions, Bartleby has no 
other treasure.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter 
use the improved versions of Bartleby’s rogue abili-
ties listed under “Difficulty Increase.”

THE KEY
During the chaos that resulted in the years following 
the second earthquake, the celestials sealed off this 
portion of the dungeon, locking all the doors leading 
north. None of the doors that lead to Region E can 
be opened or unlocked without the aid of a key found 
in Region C (Room C105 to be exact). The celestials 
entrusted the key to the lantern archon in Region C, 
who in turn hid it in a room full of false keys.
When this fake key is used to unlock any of the 
doors leading north, a sonic blast trap is triggered. In 
addition to the damage caused to the PCs, the sound 
automatically alerts all creatures in adjacent rooms.
 '
Thunderous Glyph of Warding Trap. As the incorrect 
key is inserted, the channels align with the trigger 
mechanism, setting off a series of ominous clicks 
and thuds. A magic hum whirrs for only a moment, 
during which time those who can perceive magic 
will bear witness to white hot runes searing the area 
around the lock. Seconds later a thunderous blast 
rips from the keyhole. Any creature within 5 ft must 
succeed a (DC 13) Dexterity saving throw or take 
8d4 Thunder damage and be knocked back 10 ft. 
Creatures that succeed the saving throw take half 
damage and are not moved.
The trap is ancient, with evocation magic inside 
only glowing faintly when idle, and invisible without 
detect magic. Succeeding an Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check (DC 15) gives the player the impression 
that the lock is suspiciously made, appearing to 
accept false keys for an unknown purpose.
Dispel magic will eliminate the trap, but the door 
remains locked. After detonating or being dispelled 
the trap resets in 1d6 minutes.
PCs using the real key are allowed passage to 
Region E. Use the following encounter for every door 
that leads to Region F.
B0. LOCKED DOOR
This Encounter is not printed on the Map. Instead, 
anytime a PC attempts to leave the Region through 
doors to the north, read the following:
Before you stands a door. Bound in iron, and 
standing over 10 ft tall it is unlike any door you’ve 
ever seen. The keyhole is a giant griffon head, its 
mouth agape.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This door is locked and cannot be opened 
by any means short of the key in Room C105. Any 
attempt to open it with either the wrong key, a 
Sleight of Hand, or knock triggers a Thunderous 
Glyph of Warding trap (see above). PCs that attempt 
to disable or dispel the trap find that it resets itself 
in 1d6 minutes.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Any attempt to discern the properties of the 
door gives the impression of heavy amounts of 
abjuration magic, a complex (almost unbeatable) 
lock, and a magical trap that triggers when the lock 
is tampered with. The GM is more than welcome 
to assign DCs to the checks necessary to learn this 
information, but it is crucial that they learn it none-
theless. Allow them to spend 30 minutes study-
ing the door.
The door itself is sturdy, made of iron, and with 
hinges mounted on the other side from where 
the party is. The PCs should also realize that a key 
does exist for it (as the tumblers are exact and 
meticulous) and using the wrong key triggers the 
trap as well.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: It is not recommended that you increase or 
decrease the difficulty of this encounter. PCs who 
persist with this lock are asking for trouble. GMs 
should not “kill” the PCs with this trap, but instead 
hint that it can’t be bypassed at the moment.

117
SOME THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND
The PCs should be 3rd or 4th level when they reach this Section of the dungeon. That means even twelve 
goblins won’t be much trouble.
In order to keep the challenge, the GM should try a few things.
One. Give your goblins a significant baseline edge. 
Throw a standing +4 to their initiative roles be-
cause this is their home turf. Add +2 to attacks 
for the well-defended backline in formation. 
Throw in some unexpected weapons scavenged by 
lucky raiders.
Two. Add toughness. What’s wrong with trained gob-
lins having a few extra hit points. It would be worse 
if you gave them extra levels, right?
Three. Add natural armor. A +2 or +4 AC bonus makes 
the goblins tougher but also means that rogues and 
clerics are going to be less useful.
Four. Aid Another. With so many goblins, the Help 
Action really adds up. Don’t be afraid to have a few 
of the goblins extend a helping hand.
Five. Dogpile. Goblins working together to tackle a 
dwarf or human barbarian severely weaken a group 
that’s grown too reliant on the 12 points of damage 
per round 19 Strength, two-handed great greataxe, 
raging, killing machine. Before the barbarian even 
thinks of raging, he’s on the ground, prone and 
weaponless.
Six. Give the goblins the benefit of the doubt. They 
know the PCs are on the move and they know how 
to lure them into traps. Triplines across doorways, 
nearby reinforcements ready to attack from the 
rear, and signal whistles add up to one memorable 
encounter.
Seven. Limit the PCs’ options before they get here. 
Spells like fireball should be limited at this point in 
the campaign, so fighting in tight ranks won’t hurt 
the goblins. Don’t let a wizard with one spell spoil 
your adventures. Plan for it. Build around it.
Eight. Add a hobgoblin to every encounter. While not 
all of them need to be 4th-level fighters, a 1st-level 
fighter at the back of the ranks, directing the action 
and throwing alchemical fire or firing a heavy cross-
bow does more than increase the CR by 1.
Nine. Stagger the assaults. Eventually the barbarian 
tires out. His rage goes away and another wave 
of goblins arrive on the final round of his “energy 
boost.” How did that happen?
Ten: Add Encounter Conditions that we didn’t think 
of. Make the room pitch black in a 5 ft radius or 
add a stench effect (similar to troglodytes) that the 
goblins are immune to (or used to).
GOBLIN TACTICS, OR 20 WAYS TO DIE
Many of the rooms in this Region resemble one an-
other. This is intentional. Once the goblins descend 
on the PCs it is most likely they will be fighting wave 
after wave of reinforcements. And with 25% of the 
goblin population out patrolling at any given time, a 
battle in a hallway or room brings the goblins in the 
adjacent areas down upon the PCs quickly.
And because the goblins have been trained by hob-
goblins, they all carry similar weapons and fight with 
the same tactics. This makes the range of Encounters 
limited. PCs are likely to get bored after the third 
room. This is where the GM comes in.
If played out properly, a single goblin Encounter 
can take up half the evening. By having wave after 
wave of reinforcements pushing into the room, PCs 
are likely to tire quickly. Or at the very least, have 
their patience tested, when the door to the room 
opens for the fourth time with another wave of twelve 
goblins. Worse yet, the first three waves are there just 

118
Eleven. Improvise. Marines don’t plan. They adapt. 
Effective goblin assaults should be no different. If 
the tactics in this book don’t work, change them. 
Have them shore up a weak point, send in a smaller 
goblin to aid with flanks, or carry slings in addition 
to spears to take advantage of the second ranks.
Twelve: Add cool magical effects. Give the goblins 
potions of orc blood (the undercommon version of 
heroism) allowing them to rage for 3 rounds or gain 
+2 Strength for 2d6 rounds. Maybe their weapons 
are coated with a sleep poison or something that 
just deals 1 point on the following round, enough to 
make the PCs nervous. “Hey. They’ve got +1 wound-
ing spears. What gives?”
Thirteen. Make the religion real. The goblin’s faith is 
stronger than anything and thus they benefit from 
spells like guidence and shield of faith, despite the 
lack of clerics. Heck. Add a 1st-level cleric to each 
unit. If you don‘t like clerics, add adepts, druids, or 
sorcerers with access to a domain spell list or grant-
ed power (or both).
Fourteen: Be smart. Don’t let the PC’s lure teams 
of goblins into stupid grease tricks. Anytime the 
PCs are backing up and don’t look injured, trained 
soldiers know that means trouble. The goblins 
should hold back, send for reinforcements, and 
batter the PCs later with some magical assistance or 
brute strength.
Fifteen: Pace the encounters. Don’t let the PCs charge 
from room to room wiping out all the goblins be-
fore they sound the alarm. Lock or bar a few doors. 
Make it tough for the PCs to get into the more 
protected areas.
Sixteen. Give the goblins advantage on all saving 
throws vs. spell effects.
Seventeen. Choose your battles. The goblins don’t 
have to fight the PCs every time. They can lure the 
PCs out of a room and force them to fight in a con-
fined space, where their larger weapons are useless.
Eighteen. Worgs. The goblins have dire wolves, 
howlers, worgs, and yeth hounds at their disposal. 
Give each goblin unit some firepower with a canine 
or lupine companion. Perhaps a blink dog was 
corrupted by the taint of the stables? Perhaps they 
found a destrachan from Region D?
Nineteen. Drop the anvil. Once the PCs are out of 
spells, potions, and wand charges, have the big 
boys show up and make the PCs rely on wits in-
stead of magic.
Twenty. Make the PCs work for it. If the PCs are 
smart about it, they can decimate the entire goblin 
army in less than a week, or become another in the 
long list of victims that have fallen under Haglar’s 
or Hammerfist’s boot. No encounter in this dun-
geon should be “easy.“ Take the next step and show 
the PCs what you’re made of.
to weaken the PCs, using up their magic for the real 
final battle with Goblinbane.
To complicate matters, should the PCs successfully 
beat back everything you throw at them, they’ll need 
to find a place to rest and that patrol or scouting par-
ty is due back any minute, more than ready to go for 
help, should they see the PCs standing knee deep in 
dead goblins. PCs on the run from goblins? Never.
And if word gets back to the goblin king that half 
his army is dead, a worg cavalry unit and a few hob-
goblin bodyguards can be hunting the PCs down in 
no time flat.

B1-B48 . THE ABANDONED  
HALLS OF THE CELESTIALS
Unlike the other Sections of the Region, this initial 
expanse is not lorded over by any one particular 
group. The earthquake damaged this section the 
least, and the celestials that survive in traps and 
puzzles make the goblinoids wary about settling here.
Blink dogs and dire wolves have taken advantage 
of the lack of goblinoids in the area, and many dens 
are scattered throughout these rooms. A few packs of 
howlers prowl the area, though most howlers live in 
the Wild Caverns (Rooms B119 through B133).
The celestials used this Section to study and 
document evil. It was a quiet place for the more 
scholarly angels to note anything unusual about the 
evil and unholy beasts they guarded. Several rooms 
recorded how demons and devils reacted to traps 
and puzzles.
In general, the air is musty. As few things live here, 
the odors of life and death are not as prevalent. While 
the PCs may not have to worry about encountering 
a staggering number of monsters, they need to 
keep their wits sharper than their swords. There is a 
reason the goblinoids merely patrol this Section—
the celestials’ traps are daunting and difficult 
to overcome.
 '
Portcullis Trap. When 15 lbs. of weight are applied 
to the pressure plate on either side of the arch a 
portcullis slams down. Creatures underneath are 
skewered and crushed and must succeed a Dexterity 
saving throw (DC 13) or take 2d8 piercing and 2d8 
bludgeoning damage. Additionally, creatures that 
fail to save are pinned underneath, preventing 
movement until freed. Any creature that can lift 200 
lbs. of weight can reliably lift the gate 1 ft off the 
ground, with the weight requirement doubling for 
each additional foot of distance desired.
While not subtle, the trap still requires active 
attention to notice. Once found the plate can 
simply be stepped over, or disabled by wedging the 
pressure plate.
The pressure plates are clumsy and obvious, only 
requiring a (DC 10) Wisdom (Perception) check to 
spot. Disarming the gate is similarly trivial, only 
requiring a (DC 12) Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check 
to pin the plates in place.

A bugbear sets up a tripwire. He may or may

seconds, Wisdom (Perception) checks are 
made at disadvantage, at which point he 
finishes setting up the tripwire.
15
2d4 goblins (half of which ride worgs) patrol 
the Section, looking for anything to report 
back to their king. When the PCs are spotted, 
one rides off for help while the others fight 
defensively to stop the PCs from getting 
further into the Region.

19
The PCs stumble upon a hallway trapped

20
Bartleby the Halfling (Room B28) is 
crouching behind a wall waiting for a 
small group of 2d4 goblins to pass. He has 
disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
against the PCs until the 2d4 goblins have 
left the area (which takes 2d4 rounds).

120
They are thin enough for non-small PCs to 
simply step across. This trap resets only when the 
knock spell is cast on it, which is a preferred method 
of the celestial caretakers.
 '
Razor Wire. Difficult to spot (DC 14 Wisdom 
(Perception) check) filaments of magically 
sharpened wire are strung haphazardly across the 
hallway. Contact with which causes deep cuts and 
deadly tangling. Each creature caught in the trap 
receives 1d6 slashing damage and must succeed a 
Dexterity saving throw or be tangled.
Tangled creatures take 1d6 slashing damage 
each combat round (or every 6 seconds) and 
another 1d6 if they attempt to free themselves. A 
successful Strength save (DC 11) frees the affected 
creature, ending the effect. Other non-trapped 
creatures may spend an action to attempt to 
free them, requiring a (DC 10) Strength check 
to succeed. On a success or failure, the rescuer 
receives 1d6 slashing damage.
Once spotted disarming requires a trivial (DC 8) 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to sever the wires 
from the wall. The process is lengthy however, 
requiring 20 minutes of work to fully clear. 
Partially cleared (10 minutes of work at least) gives 
advantage on saves made to resist the trap’s effects 
for potential victims.
 '
Tripping Chain. Strung across the path is a thin 
chain. Robust enough to be a tripping hazard, and 
acting as a setup for a much nastier chain. Both 
are simple and crudely concealed (DC 11) Wisdom 
(Perception) required to spot). Stepping on the first 
chain will knock the victim prone unless they pass a 
Dexterity or Strength saving throw (DC 12), wherein 
they must make a second Dexterity saving throw 
(DC 14) to take half damage from falling onto the 
spiked chain.
Creatures that step onto the spiked chain 
receive 2d8 piercing damage as the wicked hooks 
and barbs rend at them. They may also trip from 
this, requiring the same saves as above but done 
with advantage this time. Reduce this damage 
by 1 for every point of AC the creature possesses 
over 12. Creatures that fall onto the chain receive 
an additional 1d8 damage for each size category 
they are above small (medium +1d8, large +2d8, 
huge +3d8).
Outside of adverse circumstances small and tiny 
creatures are not tall enough to fall onto the spiked 
chain and simply faceplant into the flooring.
Disarming the chains requires the removal 
of the interlocking pins that keep them taut and 
tossing them aside. No check is needed once 
spotted. The mechanism isn’t completely intuitive, 
however. Less mechanically inclined PCs might 
require a successful Intelligence (Investigation) 
(DC 10) check to understand.
 '
Burning Hands Trap. Odd pairs of ethereal blue 
hands dot the walls, their gestures queer to those 
not in the know. Magically inclined PCs, or those 
that pass an Intelligence (Arcana) (DC 13) check 
recognize these as somatic spell components frozen 
in time. The spells they would be casting are diverse 
and easily recognizable by those who know the 
spells. A knock here, a commune there; goodberry, 
raise dead, alter self. Of the 30 hands present, all 
save for one are “casting” harmless spells. Any 
Intelligence (Investigation) check by a magic-user 
should yield the above list as suggestions for the 
potential spells they might be casting, with burning 
hands added in if they roll a 13 or greater. Should 
they keep inquiring, simply consult the spell list for 
more harmless spells to have them “casting.” Given 
enough time and prodding the PCs would stumble 
across the burning hands pair.
Creatures that can see magic will see each hand 
enchanted with a faint glow corresponding to their 
assigned spell’s school.
Each pair can be permanently dispelled with a 
dispel magic cast (DC 12).
If you would like the hands to cast their 
associated spells go right ahead, but for now, 
the only pair capable of casting a spell are those 
forming burning hands. Creatures that cross an 
invisible line from between the fingers of the 
burning hands to the opposite wall trigger the 
casting. The burning hands spell is cast at level 1 
targeting the far wall each time the mechanism is 
triggered, resetting after 6 seconds while the hands 
perform the gestures to ready it again.
The mechanism cannot be disarmed with 
physical tools, though a clever rogue might realize 
it can be simply ducked under or triggered with 
objects given some experimentation and/or a 
successful Intelligence (Investigation) (DC 14) check.

121
THE ARTIFACT
The (doppelganger) goblin king, Argliss, has 
lost a powerful artifact. At some point during 
his rise to power over the goblins, the artifact 
disappeared. While it is not crucial to his 
reign, he does not wish for it to fall into the 
hands of his many enemies and rivals to his 
throne. His new position does not allow him 
to search, but a halfling, Bartleby, is more 
than happy to search for the artifact. He has 
gained the protection of the dominant faction 
in the Region and enjoys enormous freedom. 
He has no plans to turn the artifact over to 
Argliss, however. Anything that powerful is not 
something you give away lightly. Once he has 
found the artifact Bartleby plans to leave the 
Region entirely, using his newfound power as 
he sees fit.
What the artifact is, however, is strictly up 
to the GM. It could be something so truly 
powerful that whoever has possession of it can 
rule the Region, or it could be a red herring 
to draw the PCs’ attention away from the real 
dangers in the Region.
POSSIBLE ARTIFACTS
 
Clay Golem Manual. The ability to craft golems 
gives the PCs a powerful tool for navigating 
the dungeon.
 
Medallion of Thoughts. Reading the thoughts 
and intentions of the more deceitful denizens 
the PCs could prove invaluable to their 
survival.
 
Necklace of Adaptation. Eventually the PCs will 
need to cross the Lake (Region L) and being 
able to breathe underwater might help.
 
Phylactery of Undead Turning. Useful for the 
ghouls and wights found in the later rooms 
of the dungeon.
 
Rod of Cancellation. The PCs are not the only 
group in the dungeon using magical items to 
aid them. The capacity to remove the power 
of their opponents’ items could be key to 
their survival.
POSSIBLE LOCATIONS
 
Room B92, The Maze. With its constant 
dangers, placing the artifact in the maze 
makes for a harrowing quest. Due to the 
goblin’s superstitious fears of the maze, a 
legend has sprung up about a daring thief 
who fled with the king’s treasure into the 
maze, only to be punished by Norendithas 
Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter of 
Foes. The thief in question is eternally trapped 
in the maze, with the goblin king’s treasure 
lost in its confusing, dangerous confines.
 
Room B111, The Killing Grounds. Controlled 
by the undead of the Region, this room is 
a natural place for the artifact to have been 
misplaced. Whoever stole it fled here, only to 
be assaulted by the wights. It could be hiding 
in plain sight amongst the refuse in the room, 
or it could have been buried under the dirt 
floor. Fighting off the ghouls, as well as the 
dangers of the room itself, presents a unique 
challenge to any who seek the artifact here.
 
Room B136, Norendithas Stoneshaper the 
Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes’ Shrine. 
Maybe the wayward hunter-turned-deity stole 
the artifact from the goblin king. If that’s the 
case it has been sealed in the now holy statue. 
Even Argliss would be hesitant to desecrate 
the source of his influence over the goblins in 
an effort to retrieve the artifact. The zealous 
nature of the goblins that guard the shrine 
presents unique issues for would-be treasure 
hunters.
 
Region C. Perhaps somewhere in Region C, 
the artifact has slipped through the hands of 
the goblins and into the clutches of the black 
dragon, giants, gnolls, or chaotic oozes that 
roam the corridors.
In the end, these are merely suggestions. The 
artifact can be anything and anywhere, or 
nothing and nowhere. It is solely up to the GM 
how he wishes to run the campaign.

122
B1. ENTRANCEWAY
This corridor is obviously old, but it is in fairly good 
shape. The air is musty, and a thin layer of dust 
coats the area. The walls are plain and free of mold 
or lichen. It stretches straight ahead for roughly 
30 ft. A second hall joins this corridor roughly 10 ft. 
from the entrance, while the corridor itself turns to 
the left at the end.
Encounter: The hall, while looking nondescript, 
holds the first of the celestials’ traps, as well as a 
secret entrance to Room B3. A successful Wisdom 
(Perception) (DC 15) check reveals a stone door, 
flush with the northern wall. The door is trapped. 
Opening the door triggers the trap; a large double-
bit ax head that swings out towards the hallway. 
Before the door can be fully opened a successful 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 15) check is required 
to unlock it, allowing it to be opened and permitting 
the party to enter Room B3.
Ten feet into the room, where it meets the 
second hall, a pressure-triggered trapdoor awaits. 
It opens into a 10-ft-wide-by-20-ft deep pit filled 
with several sharpened spikes. It is triggered as 
soon as someone steps on the stone floor. Springs 
hidden under the trapdoor reset the trap once it 
is triggered. A Wisdom (Perception) check with a 
roll of 15 or greater alerts the PC’s that the floor 
above the pit has a thinner layer of dust than the 
surrounding area. See below for full trap rules.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the difficulty of this encounter, 
double the depth of the pit and roll 5d10 for the 
ax-trap instead of 2d20. To reduce the difficulty, 
double the amount of temporary hit points granted 
to players caught in the pit trap.
 '
Scything Blade Trap (door mounted). When pried 
open the door easily allows one inch of clearance. 
Doing so reveals the keyhole and arms the spring-
loaded ax. A specific key, which might be found on 
someone important, will disarm the mechanism 
and open the lock. Otherwise, simply picking the 
lock is doable, but results in the door flying free 
on spring-loaded hinges with the ax scything 
into the hallway. Creatures within 5 ft. of the 
door must succeed two separate Dexterity saving 
throws (DC 13).
The first save avoids the swinging door and 
allows them to stay in place. Creatures that fail this 
save take 1d8 bludgeoning damage, knocking the 
creature back 5 ft in any direction, out of the way of 
the axe. If there is no room for the creature they are 
hit and knocked prone instead.
Standing, Medium-sized creatures and above 
that remain within 5 ft of the trap after the door 
springs open must succeed their second save or be 
struck by the swinging ax. Pick the first to be struck 
and roll 2d20. Subtract that target's AC from the 
amount, and deal that much slashing damage to 
them. If more than zero damage is dealt, perform 
this again for each creature in line to be struck 
using the remaining damage instead of the initial 
roll for each subsequent hit. (e.g., GM rolls a 24, the 
first creature struck has 13 AC, they take 11 damage. 
The ax swings through, hitting the next creature 
who has 10 AC, which reduces the remaining 11 
damage they would take down to 1, continuing 
until zero).
To disarm the trap the door must remain locked 
and opened as much as it allows. The mechanism 
can be tripped from the inside with a (DC 13) 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. As the guide pins 
pop loose the axe slams loudly into the closed door 
before the stress on the mechanism ruptures its 
hinges and it clanks worthlessly against the floor.
 '
Spiked Pit Trap. When 15 lbs. or more of weight 
are applied to the 10 ft. wide trap door panel the 
clutch releases, dropping the section on a hinge 
and plunging any creature atop it into a 20-ft 
pit. A feat of Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength 
(Athletics) would be required to mitigate the 
ensuing skewering on the spikes below. Creatures 
will choose which skill to use, and roll the check as 
normal. The resulting roll is gained as temporary 
hit points (representing their heroic attempts to 
grapple with the pit walls and dodge the spikes), 
before they take 3d10 piercing damage, in addition 
to fall damage.
These temporary hit points are lost when 
they exit the pit and stack with other sources of 
temporary hit points.

123
Disabling the trigger requires crossing to the 
far side (a 10 ft, jump) and wedging the hinge with 
something sturdy, which requires a (DC 7) Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand).
B2 . ABANDONED GUARD POST
This room is long and narrow. Toppled benches and 
tables lie in disarray throughout the space. Weapon 
racks stand empty in the western corner. Whoever 
used this room has long since deserted it. The 
dust is thicker in here than in previous rooms and 
you kick it up into the air with every step. Several 
burnt-out torches lie on the floor as well and the 
air has a slightly smoky quality to it. Strange 
carvings line the back wall, and an aged leather 
hide hangs on the eastern wall.
A secret door in the southeast corner can be 
discovered by a successful Wisdom (Perception) 
(DC 15) check. The door’s lock is jammed and requires 
a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 15) check 
to open. The door leads to Room B4.
Encounter Condition: Haunted
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Wedged between two stones in the 
corner of the room is a small tarnished and 
chipped silver dagger. It can be found by PCs who 
roll a 15+ on Wisdom (Perception) checks while 
examining the room.
Scaling: N/A
B3 . OBSERVATORY
The ax swings lazily in the doorway. Stepping 
around it you enter a stark chamber. Along the 
western wall is a table and chair, both built 
of stone. Along the northern wall rests a large 
bookcase. Only a few ancient leather-bound 
books remain on its shelves. Aside from these few 
furnishings, the chamber is empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was built to observe the 
demonic and devilish prisons of this Region. The 
celestials crafted it to be as unobtrusive as possible. 
From here they could freely observe the unholy 
hordes closely. It has been abandoned for quite 
some time.
The leather books remaining are quite fragile. 
Unless the PCs are incredibly careful, the pages 
crumble when handled. Unless one of the PCs is 
fluent in Celestial, the text requires a successful 
Wisdom (Insight) check (DC 18) to translate. Even 
if a PC understands Celestial, the text is in such 
disarray, that another successful Insight check 
(DC 15) to translate is required to make sense of it.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The few remaining journals, if deciphered, 
give the PCs a broad sense of the previous 
inhabitants in this dungeon. They primarily detail 
the demons and devils that were here 2,000 years 
ago. If this is the first the PCs have learned of the 
purpose of the dungeon, allow each person reading 
the tome a single question.
Scaling: N/A
B4 . SECRET ARMORY
The door slides inward, creaking loudly on rusty 
hinges. The interior is dark, but it is not impossible 
to see into the room. The walls are lined with racks 
and racks of simple weapons: spears, clubs, and 
slings. The spearheads are dull, but the dry air has 
prevented them from rusting. Two large barrels 
towards the back of the chamber are filled with 
small rocks, obviously ammunition for the slings. 
Someone is obviously stockpiling weapons for a 
prolonged conflict, and they might be back soon.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears that were formerly 
stationed in Room B2 kept their weapons in this 
hidden storage room. The weapons are crude and 
even a layman can tell they were hastily built.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The room contains two dozen javelins. 
They are of inferior quality, but not to the point 
which causes any meaningful trouble. The two 
barrels, combined, hold roughly 170 lbs. of gravel 
suitable for use as bullets for the three dozen 
slings contained in the armory. The dozen clubs 
found here are not discernable in any way from 
other clubs.
Scaling: N/A

B5 . TRAP ROOM
As the PCs approach the door to Room B5, read the 
following.
The corridor wraps around a square structure in 
the center of this room. As you walk around it you 
notice a large stone door set in the center of the 
wall’s western side. The stone of the door is slightly 
darker than the walls and is carved with various 
indecipherable runes.
The door to this room is trapped.
 '
Falling Stone Trap. The trigger to the falling stone 
trap is embedded in the handle of the stone door. 
Attempting to open the stone door by grasping 
the handle causes the handle to pull outwards 
while the door remains shut. After an ominous 
click an enchanted slab of stone, pocked by time 
and use, silently falls. Its immense weight slams 
into anything within 10 feet of the door. Creatures 
must make a Dexterity (DC 14) saving throw or 
take 4d8 bludgeoning damage as they are caught 
underneath. Objects cannot make this save, and 
take double damage. Any that succeed are pushed 
to the edge of the falling block as they scramble out 
of the way. After ten seconds the block raises and 
resets. Opening the door by prying the gap safely 
avoids the crushing. While the door is open the trap 
will not trigger so as to not damage the door itself.
When the PCs enter the room, read the following.
The room is large and empty apart from a pedestal 
resting against the far wall. The floor is tiled in 
dark granite, with a line of polished white marble 
leading from the door to the pedestal. Upon the 
pedestal, there is a golden idol embedded with two 
emerald gems for eyes and a pearl set in its belly.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This is a particularly difficult encounter 
and if the PCs are smart, they will leave before it 
escalates.
The celestials that occupied Room B3 designed 
this room to test the intelligence of the prisoners. It 
contains a series of three traps, each slightly more 
advanced and deadly than the next. The room itself 
is 30 ft. wide by 40 ft long.
The first test is the door to the room. This is the 
most straightforward of the traps.
The second trap is built into the floor of the 
room. The floor tiles are the key to this trap. Each 
tile is 2-ft-by-2-ft The obvious path is straight down 
the middle, following the white marble. Of course 
any path that obvious must be a trap. The celestials 
took this into account. To circumvent this trap the 
PCs must travel down, staying on either side of the 
path, walking a thin line. The white and black tiles 
nearest each other represent the only safe paths 
to the pedestal. The PCs must stay within the 4-ft. 
wide path created by the joined black and white 
tiles. If they stray to either side of these paths, the 
trap triggers, raining metal shards and caltrops on 
the occupants of the room from concealed slots in 
the ceiling.
A successful Wisdom (Perception) (DC 12) check 
reveals the paths are slightly more worn than the 
surrounding tiles while a roll of 16+ reveals the 
nature of the trap.
If the PCs can make it to the idol, they must 
circumvent a third trap to claim the prize. This is 
a simple pressure plate under the idol. If the PCs 
do not disable it before they remove the idol, the 
plate triggers spring-loaded poisoned darts hidden 
behind the eastern wall. Once the PCs have the idol 
they can safely leave the room.
 '
Raining Shards. When the appropriate tile is 
depressed by more than 10 lbs. of force the room-
wide trap triggers. Slots in the ceiling drop metal 
blades onto every inch of the space beneath them. 
No amount of dodging can save those caught in the 
gale of sharpened metal. Creatures within the room 
take 4d10 slashing damage, minus the victim’s AC 
(minimum zero), and an additional 2d10 if they are 
not wearing any head-covering.
Creatures with shields have resistance to the 
damage dealt by this trap.
If a creature is within 5 ft. of another that is at 
least a size larger than them they can attempt a 
Dexterity saving throw (DC 14) to halve the damage. 
This trap fires once per room reset.
 '
Spring-loaded Darts. When half the idol’s weight 
is added to or removed from the pedestal a spray 
of darts snap across the room. Starting from the 
east wall any creature not completely obscured by 

125
another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving 
throw or take 2d8 piercing damage and be poisoned 
until their next long rest.
The trap-holes can be found with a DC 16 
Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled 
with a further DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand). 
Undoing this mechanism leaves the darts open for 
the taking. The first time a dart deals damage it 
loses its poison and poisons the target if they fail a 
Constitution (DC 14) save.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: As soon as the idol passes beyond the 
doorway it instantly turns to dust, the traps reset, 
and the door closes. This was the final test the 
celestials had—to determine if demons would 
continually pursue a futile goal.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
upgrade the spring-loaded darts trap to a fusillade 
of spears trap, increasing the damage dice to d12s. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the damage of 
the raining shards trap to 6d4.
B6 . HALL OF MIRRORS
The floor and walls of this large room are covered 
in mirrors. As soon as you enter, a stone door 
slams down from the ceiling, sealing the entrance 
behind you.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is a single huge trap. With 
every surface covered in mirrors, it is impossible to 
find a way out. The door the PCs entered through 
is sealed and is no longer an exit. Only by finding 
the trap’s trigger and disabling it are the PCs able 
to leave this room. If they cannot, they are trapped 
here until they expire. The trigger is located in 
the northwestern corner, near the floor. A hairline 
crack (DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence 
(Investigation) check to spot) in a mirror is the only 
hint the PCs have to the trigger’s location. The 
crack is actually the edge of a removable panel that 
reveals the trigger. Succeeding a Dexterity (Sleight 
of Hand) check (DC 14) flips the switch and swings 
all four doors open.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase all of the DCs for the hall of mirrors trap by 
+2. To decrease the challenge, decrease the DCs by 
-3 or merely have the door open after 24 hours.
B7 . WATERFALL
This room is rough in appearance. The walls are 
pitted and uneven, as if acid vapor eroded the 
finish. The floor is covered in discs, each two ft. in 
diameter. The discs sit higher than the floor and 
wobble slightly.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The discs in this room are the key to the 
PCs successfully navigating their way across it. They 
are designed to shift and are each mounted on a 
compact spring. The PCs must carefully make their 
way across the room, which requires a successful 
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) (DC 13) 
check. If the PCs stumble, or in any way touch the 
floor under the discs, the trap triggers. The doors to 
the room seal and torrents of water gush into the 
room from slots near the ceiling. The water pours 
in from both the east and west walls. The PCs have 
two minutes to disarm the trap or they drown. 
The release for the trap is located on the center 
of the middle wall requiring a DC 10 Intelligence 
(Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check to 
spot, and requires a successful Strength (Athletics) 
check (DC 12) to pull. Once the trap is disabled the 
water drains through grates under the discs and 
both doors to this room.
Encounter Condition: Extreme Cold, [Flooded]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the difficulty of the encounter, 
players make the Strength (Athletics) check at 
disadvantage when the timer reaches 1 minute 
remaining as the water impedes their attempts to 
pull it. To decrease the difficulty, reduce the DCs to 
spot the lever by 5.

126
B8 . GOLD MINE
The walls of this room are flecked with gold. 
The roughly square room is filled with mounds 
of dirt and rubble. Crude picks, shovels, and the 
bones of several small goblinoids lay scattered 
on the ground. The gold flecks glow and entice 
you forward.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room, while clearly attractive to 
greedy PCs, is as much a trap as anything else 
in the Region. Touching the gold flecks releases 
poison gas into the room. As the door seals them 
in, the PCs have little choice but to disable the trap 
to survive. As long as the PCs do not touch the gold 
flecks, the trap does not trigger. There are no flecks 
on the floor at all.
If the PCs trigger the trap, they have to act 
swiftly to turn it off.
In the middle of the room is a squat stalagmite. 
A successful Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom 
(Perception) (DC 15) reveals a series of three knobby 
buttons. To disable the trap and open the door 
they must be pressed in the correct sequence. One 
attempt may be performed by the PCs each round. 
Each attempt they will roll 3 separate Intelligenc e 
(Investigation) checks (DC 15). Make note of each 
success and failure as a score.
When 3 failures have been noted across multiple 
attempts, reset the scores and start anew. When 
3 successes are recorded the PCs have found the 
correct sequence, the trap disarms, and the door 
opens. If a tie occurs (both hit 3 simultaneously) 
the state with any extra score wins. In the case of a 
perfect tie, reset the round as if they had failed, but 
have the PCs start with one success going into the 
new attempt.
After 24 seconds from the initial triggering 
the gas will start to leave lasting harm. Creatures 
caught in the room must succeed a Constitution 
saving throw (DC 8 + rounds elapsed) or take 
1d6 poison damage for each time they’ve failed 
this save.
Encounter Condition: [Smoke]
Tactics: Once the trap is disarmed (or if it was never 
triggered), the PCs who make Wisdom (Perception) 
or Intelligence (Investigation) checks with a roll of 
17+ notice the transparent outline of angel wings on 
the back wall. Faint and depressed, these grooves 
are used to open the secret door leading to Room 
B13. If a PC you feel would be deemed “good” by 
the virtue locks used by the celestials touches the 
grooves by laying their palms flat, the wall rises up 
and remains open for 5 rounds. The secret door 
cannot be opened from the other side.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the poison gas trap with an insanity mist 
vapor trap. Creatures that fail their Constitution 
saving throw must move toward and take an 
attack action against the nearest creature on their 
next turn, instead of receiving poison damage. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the poison damage 
to a d4 or even a d2.
B9 . DIRE WOLF DEN
As the PCs approach the room, read the following.
As you make your way down the hall, you hear 
heavy breathing coming from behind the door up 
ahead. The air is dank with a discernible odor as if 
something were living here.
Once the door is open, read the following.
Your torches have trouble cutting through the 
darkness in the room. All that you smell is a dank 
odor that clings to everything. From the shadows a 
pair of large wolves rush out, fighting—nipping at 
each other’s heels. Their hackles are raised as they 
would be when fighting for dominance. Turning 
and snapping, the two creatures snarl and lunge, 
attacking wildly.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The PCs have stumbled onto a pair of dire 
wolves that were trapped in this room. They have 
been quarreling for some time, but now happily 
have something new to dominate. They attack the 
PCs on sight, fighting to the death if necessary.
If no one holds the door open, it slams behind 
the PCs. From the inside, the door is locked and 
requires a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
or Strength (Athletics) (DC 17) check to escape. The 
other two doors are not locked, however.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Deep Darkness, 
Fearless, [Stagnant Air]

127
Tactics: Light in this room is reduced to a 5 ft. radius, 
no matter how powerful the source. This puts PCs 
without darkvision at a major disadvantage.
The dire wolves have been trapped here for 
weeks, but do not fight as cohesively as pack 
animals normally do. They do not flank or aid one 
another or use any tactics to gain an advantage over 
an opponent. Instead, they simply choose a target 
and focus their energies solely on them.
If the PCs stumble around in the dark, they can 
find the carcasses of four other wolves littered here. 
Apparently, they turned on each other once they 
were trapped in this room. The two that survived 
were the largest and the strongest.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two dire wolves. To decrease the challenge, 
reduce their hit points by -15 each.
B10 . BUGBEAR REFUGE
As the PCs approach the room, read the following.
A splintered wooden door blocks the entrance to 
this room. From behind it, you can hear a quarrel 
in a foul tongue. Something yells and a loud crash 
reverberates through the halls.
Removing the splintered wooden door without 
making a noise requires succeeding a Dexterity 
(Stealth) check (DC 12+ Bugbear’s Perception 
modifier). A DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check is also 
required to carefully move the door without scraping 
it against the stone walls.
If the PCs remain in the hallway for more than 
10 turns, have the PCs all make Dexterity (Stealth) 
checks. Then, roll a Wisdom (Perception) check for the 
Bugbear, using the lowest Dexterity (Stealth) check 
result as the DC.
If the PCs make a noise in the hall that a bugbear 
notices, the arguing coming from inside the room 
stops immediately. The bugbears take defensive 
positions behind makeshift cover and prepare to 
ambush the PCs as soon as one of the doors is 
pushed ajar.
If the PCs enter without being noticed, read the 
following.
Three furry goblinoids point and shout at one 
another, obviously engaged in a heated debate. The 
creatures are muscular and brutish, each standing 
about seven feet tall. Coarse hair covers their 
bodies and chipped and crooked fangs protrude 
from their snarling mouths. The largest spits as 
he screams at the smallest, who apparently isn’t 
backing down.
All around the room, debris and broken wood 
obscure the stone floor.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Three bugbears have made this room 
their refuge, but have been unable to leave for two 
weeks because of the dire wolves in Room B9. They 
are stir-crazy now and arguing with each other (in 
Common) about who cheated at a dice game that 
obviously isn’t being played.
If surprised, allow the middle bugbear a DC 16 
Wisdom (Perception) check to notice someone 
entering. The largest and smallest bugbears are 
automatically surprised if the PCs enter without 
making any noise.
Encounter Condition: [Ambush], [Cover], Echoes 3, 
Poor Footing 2
Tactics: If an encounter takes place in the room, the 
bugbears swarm the nearest PC, taking a defensive 
position until they have a handle on the situation. 
If the leader drops to zero hit points, flip a coin. 
Heads, the other two surrender. Tails, they become 

128
enraged (Barbarian rage feature, as if they were 
level 3s).
If the encounter takes place in the hall two 
bugbears engage the PCs, forcing them away from 
the entrance to the room, while the smallest runs 
around to the other side of the corridor, to wedge 
the PCs in.
Treasure: Hidden under the debris in this room is a 
small strongbox (Intelligence (Investigation) check, 
DC 18 to locate). The lock is simple and crude, but 
gummed up with grime, requiring a successful 
DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock, 
or DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to smash the 
faulty mechanism and pry the box open. When the 
strongbox is opened, a thin wire running along the 
hinge pushes down, cracking a vial of acid hidden 
inside the box. The bugbears normally open the box 
slowly, preventing the glass from shattering. Allow 
the PC a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 18). If they 
succeed, they hear metal scratching against glass 
and are allowed a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check to stop opening the box before rupturing the 
vial. If the PC makes no intimation that they are 
opening the box slowly, do not allow any checks.
If the vial cracks (which is automatic if the rolls 
fail or the PC is hurried), an alchemical reaction 
occurs and the acid inside, reacting with the 
surrounding air, becomes a fog that blankets a 5 ft. 
square in front of the strongbox. This lasts for 1 
minute and any creature starting their turn, ending 
their turn, or moving through the cloud receives 
2d6 acid damage.
Inside the chest are 46 sp, 24 gp, a dull pearl 
set into a gaudy necklace (25 gp), three healing 
potions, and a wand of light (spend an action to 
cast the light spell without any components, doing 
so costs 1 charge, wand is found with 2d12 charges 
remaining).
The largest bugbear keeps three keys on a ring 
on his belt. The first key goes to the strongbox 
in this room. The second is for the locked door 
leading to Room B12. The third is to the inside of 
the door in Room B9.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one bugbear. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one. These bugbears are considered the 
middle bugbear for the purposes of tactics and the 
encounter.
B11 . COLD IRON
The granite walls are dull and lifeless and the floor 
looks slick with ice. In the middle of the room are 
three pieces of iron, shaped like links in a chain. 
As you approach, the iron links shift position with 
an audible groan. They shudder and with a violent 
screech of metal on metal, finally settle.
If the links are left alone for longer than a minute 
they twist and shift of their own accord, their screech 
taking on an accusatory edge.
After the PCs step into the room, read the 
following.
The door slams behind you though the sound is 
well-masked by the iron links clattering in the room.
Attempts to catch the door require a DC 18 
Strength (Athletics) check to grab it and wrestle the 
door open. Any contact with the door before the 
puzzle is solved triggers a chill touch spell targeted at 
that creature (+7 to hit, 2d8 necrotic damage).
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Another of the puzzle traps placed by 
the celestials, this one is obviously a wrought iron 
riddle to be solved before the door will open.
The center of the three links holds the key to 
the door, but all three will lash out at any who 
approaches. Creatures “attacked” by the links must 
succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC 14) or take 
2d4 bludgeoning damage. The links will target the 
loudest creature in the room, straining to get at 
them even if they are out of reach, with no more 
than one link targeting someone at a time (the 
middle link is pulled around by the other two, and 
thus cannot lash out). The PCs must find a way to 
incapacitate, distract, or otherwise pacify the links 
to get the enchanted key that safely opens the door.
Encounter Condition: Extreme Cold, Fear 12
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the save DCs of the iron link by 5 and 
have it inflict 1d4 extra cold damage for each failed 
saving throw. To decrease the challenge of this 
encounter, decrease the trap DCs by 3 and reduce 
the chill touch effect to a 1st-level caster (+5 to hit, 
1d8 necrotic damage).

129
B12. SNAKE PIT
The southern door to this room is locked and 
requires a successful Dextertiy (Sleight of Hand) 
check (DC 19) to unlock. The door is locked.
The room is 20 feet wide, and 24 feet deep. A wide 
stone ledge is all you have to stand on, as the floor 
of the room drops off twenty feet into an unknown 
emptiness below. The floor writhes as dozens of 
snakes twist amongst sharpened metal spikes.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Having malfunctioned the last time this 
trap was sprung, it has not been reset. A DC 13 
Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the goblinoid 
skeletons scattered beneath the snakes. Unless the 
PCs can reset the trap, they are forced to maneuver 
their way around the edge of the ledge with a 
successful DC 17 Dexterity check.
On the south wall, the PCs see a small stone 
switch with a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If 
the PCs successfully strike the switch (AC 15) with a 
heavy blunt object (like a hammer) a small bridge 
springs out from the wall. Alternately, one PC can 
walk around and merely press the switch with a 
DC 8 Strength check. If the PCs entered from the 
south, then this is a no-brainer.
The bridge extends out at floor level and stops 
10 feet short of the ledge. A successful DC 12 
Strength (Athletics) check enables a PC to land 
on the bridge, but it cannot support more than 
one PC at a time. If a PC leaps onto the bridge 
with someone else standing on it, the bridge has 
a 50% chance of breaking, sending both PCs to 
the bottom of the pit. If a third PC jumps onto the 
bridge it automatically breaks.
PCs on the south side can attempt to repair 
the mechanism that drives the bridge, requiring a 
successful Intelligence (Investigation) and follow up 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (Both DC 15) to 
salvage and replace the faulty gearing. Once fixed 
the bridge extends completely.
Failing the Dexterity check by more than 5 
causes a malfunction and retracts the bridge 5 ft.
Once fixed, the bridge extends all the way to 
the ledge and supports three PCs at a time. From 
here, they can shuffle along the ledge, requiring 
a DC 14 Dexterity check to reach the exit in the 
southeast corner of the room. Since the southern 
door is locked, a PC must succeed at a DC 16 
Dexterity check while trying to unlock the door. The 
mechanism is not overly complex, but the difficulty 
of trying to open the lock as well as maintaining 
balance makes the task difficult.
If the PCs try to pass one another on the 
ledge, everyone involved must succeed at a DC 15 
Dexterity check, +2 per PC. Failure on any balance 
check indicates the PC falls. Failure by more than 10 
means he takes someone else with him.
There is another, less obvious option, for getting 
across this room. five fee below the level of the 
floor, the PCs – with a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) 
check – can discern a groove running along the wall 
of the room. Inside this groove is a 6-in.-thick floor 
that extends across the pit, if the PCs can disable 
the trigger to the trap.
The trigger is located to the left of the entryway, 
where the wall and floor would meet if the trap 
was set. The PCs can find it with a successful DC 22 
Wisdom (Perception) check. A DC 16 Dexterity 
check allows a PC to reach the trigger and two 
consecutive Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) are required 
to reset the trap (DC 14), and then disable it (DC 18). 
Once the floor is back in place, the PCs can walk 
across the room without fail.
If any PCs fall into the pit, their best course of 
action is to climb out. Since the walls are rough and 
provide handholds, the PCs can reach the ledge 
easily with a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If any PCs fall into the pit, six snakes 
(medium vipers) attack each round. While there are 
dozens and dozens of snakes they do not have a 
true strategy and they tend to lash out blindly.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter 
increase Dexterity check DCs by +2 and add 20 ft, 
of depth to the fall. To decrease the challenge, 
decrease all Wisdom (Perception) DCs by -4.

B13 . WELL OF SLEEP
If the PCs approach from the hallway, read the 
following.
As you enter this chamber, you see four doors. In 
the southeast corner of the room is a silver door. 
Its shine nearly blinds you. In the southwest comer 
of the small antechamber stands a door of dark 
wood, stained with age. In the northwest corner is 
a simple stone door and in the northeast corner, a 
finely carved stone door catches your eye.
If the PCs entered from Room B8, read the 
following.
The stone door rises, awaiting your entry. As you 
enter the room, the stone door lowers behind you, 
gracefully.
Once the PCs open the door to Room B13, read the 
following.
The room is built with polished stone. The yellow 
hue is as clean as it is even. A simple wooden 
frame hangs above the well, and a frayed rope 
descends into the inky blackness below. Echoes rise 
from the pit, as you hear scurrying noises and a 
splash of water.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room is an enigma. What the 
celestials intended for it is known only to its creator, 
who is dead. It is now the home of a few vermin 
who climb up and down the wall of the pit. From 
time to time the goblins come here as well, hoping 
to catch something to play with.
If the PCs touch the rope, an alarm spell sounds, 
alerting the goblins that someone is here. Allow 
the goblin fighters in Room B70 a DC 14 Wisdom 
(Perception) check. If successful, they come running 
to the commotion in 8d4 seconds, expecting to find 
bugs and rats.
Encounter Condition: [Ambush], Stagnant Air
Tactics: The goblins swarm into the room expecting 
trouble, but instead find the PCs. The goblins suffer 
a -4 penalty to their initiative rolls for 1d4 minutes. 
The goblins gang up in pairs, however, and if any 
PC poses the largest threat, the goblins send their 
“extras” to deal with them.
When the goblins are dispatched the PCs are 
free to gather water from the well to replenish their 
stores, but it needs to be purified before it can be 
safely drunk. If the PCs imbibe the water before 
purifying it they must succeed a Constitution 
saving throw (DC 16) or have their maximum hit 
points reduced by 3d4 until their next long rest.
The secret door leading to Room B8 cannot be 
opened from this side.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the alarm sound when one of the doors is 
opened. To decrease the challenge, the alarm only 
sounds if the rope is pulled.
B14 . OBELISK OF SHAPES
As you enter this chamber, you encounter four 
doors. In the southeast corner of the room is a 
silver door, polished to a nearly blinding shine. In 
the southwest corner of the small antechamber 
stands a dark wood door, stained with age. In the 
northwest corner is a simple stone door, and in the 
northeast corner a finely carved stone door is the 
last to catch your eye.
Once the PCs open the door to Room B14, read the 
following.
The walls of this room are a dull gray granite. The 
floor and ceiling are granite as well, but are highly 
polished. An obsidian obelisk dominates the center 
of the room. Carved into the obelisk are various 
shaped holes—circles, squares, and triangles 
among many others. In a swarm around it spin 
trinkets of varying shapes.
After the PCs step into the room, read the 
following.
The doors to the room slam shut as the shapes on 
the obelisk grind to a halt.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Similar to Room B6, this trap keeps 
the PCs in the room until it is reset. The puzzle is 
simple, meant to test the most basic of problem-
solving skills. Each hole on the obelisk has a shape 
that corresponds with it. Once it is filled the doors 
spring open.

131
Feel free to describe the puzzle in as agonizing 
detail as you like. Lead the players on with the 
depth and complexity of the strangely shaped 
necklaces and baubles that float around.
If someone wants to, they may perform whatever 
checks they deem fit for divining the nature of this 
obelisk. In case someone happens to roll higher than 
a 15 on an Wisdom (Insight) check, clue them in 
on the fact that there are an equal number of holes 
to objects.
The objects themselves are not magical, just 
held aloft with weak enchantments. The obelisk 
itself is not enchanted, instead hiding minuscule 
mechanical switches inside each slot that the 
correct object actuates.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: It is not recommended to increase the 
challenge of this encounter. It is a simple puzzle 
meant to foil creatures with animalistic minds. To 
decrease the challenge, merely have the door open 
after 24 hours.
B15 . BLINK DOG DEN
The stone door in the southeastern corner is jammed, 
requiring a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check to unstick, followed by a successful DC 9 
Strenght (Athletics Check).
Musty odors permeate the air here. The floor is 
littered with bones and scraps of cloth. Near the 
southwestern corner, in front of a large stone door, 
are the bodies of three hounds and a few goblins. 
Broken spears and ruined shields are strewn about 
the floor here as well. In the northeastern corner of 
the room is yet another stone door. This area is free 
of detritus.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: One of many rooms that have been 
taken over as a den by the blink dogs, it was 
recently sacked by a goblin war party. Aside from 
the remains of the battle, there is little of note in 
this room.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4, Distracting Visions
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Amidst the debris, the PCs can find two 
wolf teeth, a very small, jagged gold tooth (from a 
goblin), and a severed, desiccated hand.
Scaling: N/A
B16 . HALL OF THE DIVINE
Constructed of blinding white marble walls, 
and highly polished black granite, this room’s 
southeastern corner is a mess of gears and pulleys. 
The marble wall has been smashed open and the 
innards of a complex trap spill out of it. A huge 
statue of a ferocious angel (obviously female) 
wielding an ornate spear, dominates the wall. The 
statue is masterfully crafted, it’s almost lifelike 
and the spear is real, placed into the right hand of 
the statue.
If the PCs examine the statue, read the following.
At the base of the statue is a plaque that reads, “I 
shall defend this prison against all manner of evil. 
I shall die to protect this world from the horrors of 
the abyss. I shall never waiver. I shall never stop 
my quest to liberate the world from the taint of 
chaos. I shall never concede defeat.”
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Ages ago, when the bugbears were far 
more prominent, they defended this room against 
intruders, considering the beautiful statue a herald 
of what was to come. Little did they know, the 
angel was actually buried in the room, her remains 
used to build the foundation of a shrine to their 
greatest warrior. When any PCs step within 5 ft. of 
the statue, they must succeed a Wisdom saving 
throw (DC 12) or be frightened of the statue for 24 
hours, followed by the summoning of two lantern 
archons, coming out of the eyes of the statue.
They immediately determine the alignment of 
the PCs. Either use the listed alignments on their 
character sheets, or judge for yourself what the 
party’s alignment predominantly leans towards. 
If they are deemed to have strayed too far from 
“lawful” or “good” then the archons summon a 
blink dog to defend the room.
Encounter Condition: Fear 14, Positive Energy
Tactics: The lantern archons are mindless drones, 
created by the spirit of the angel who died here. 

132
The blink dogs are also made of the same celestial 
energy and attack mindlessly. They attack evil PCs 
first, followed by chaotic neutral, neutral, and finally 
chaotic good PCs (of questionable character).
Lawful good, lawful neutral, and neutral good 
PCs cannot harm these creatures. Conversely, 
lawful good PCs are immune to the frightened 
condition in this room. If any PC moves toward 
the statue or touches the spear, the blink dog and 
lantern archons attack them, ignoring alignment.
If the creatures in this room are killed, they fade 
like mist. If you would like, consider any paladin, 
no matter their chosen alignment, to be “lawful” 
alignment given their staunch adherence to their 
oath. An oath-breaker would be exempt for... 
obvious reasons. In fact the archons may judge an 
oath-breaker quite harshly.
Treasure: The statue is armed with a +1 “axiomatic” 
spear. Lawful good PCs can collect it, if they recite 
the sacred oath written at the bottom of the status. 
Should the PC ever fail in this oath, the spear 
disintegrates.
When rolling damage for an axiomatic item, if 
the target is of any chaotic alignment, remove an 
additional 1d4 hit points from that creature. Non-
lawful good PCs touching an axiomatic item suffer 
2d6 lightning damage per turn spent in contact.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
the lantern archons are summoned as soon as the 
PCs enter the room. To decrease the challenge, 
allow any PCs to fight the lantern archons and blink 
dog, but lose their immunity to the frightened 
condition.
B17. TRAPPED BLINK DOGS
As you open the door to this room, a sense of 
unease comes over you. The room is plain and 
square. It is dark, though your torches cut through 
the gloom easily enough. A musky scent wafts 
through the air, and you get the distinct impression 
you are not the only one in this room.
If the PCs enter without being noticed, read this:
Three yellow-brown dogs, nearly identical to the 
corpses in the other room, lie on the floor sleeping 
lazily., They haven’t noticed you yet, but something 
is unnerving them. The dogs shiver quietly with 
fear, whining softly from time to time.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Three blink dogs were driven into this 
room by a goblin scouting party a few weeks ago. 
The room’s Aura of Fear has them trapped.
 '
Aura of Fear. Creatures within the room must 
succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw every 
turn or be frightened of everything outside 
of the room.
If the dogs notice the PCs they immediately 
attack, taking out their frustrations on the party. 
If the party lingers in the doorway, the blink dogs 
have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to 
spot them. If the PCs make enough noise in B15 to 
draw their attention the dogs investigate. Should 
the PCs be spotted then, the blink dogs attack, 
mistaking the PCs for those who trapped them in 
the first place.
If killed, the blink dogs fade like mist.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Fear 16
Tactics: The blink dogs launch themselves at the PCs 
indiscriminately. Where they would normally attack 
the PCs individually—concentrating their attacks—
they lash out at the closest PC. Because of the 
nature of the dungeon, their blink ability is sporadic 
and has a 70% chance of failing. If successful, 
however, they flank the hapless PC. Blink dogs are 
lawful good creatures, and thus are easier to reason 
with using animal handling. If the PCs calm the 
blink dogs, the blink dogs leave the room, but do 
not become companions to the PCs. This ordeal 
has left them a little confused and they move on 
through the dungeon without much direction. If 
the PCs follow, the blink dogs investigate Room B14 
briefly, and then make their way through the rest of 
the Section.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one blink dog. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.

133
B18 . ROOM OF FIRE
The door to this room is locked, requiring a successful 
DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. 
When a PC opens the door they are hit with a wave of 
heat that deals 1d2 points of fire damage. After that, 
the Extreme Heat condition takes effect if the PCs 
enter the room.
This room is hot, close to oppressively so. The walls 
are constructed of granite with large scorch marks 
and stains. The corners contain small piles of ash. 
Against the northern wall, a simple pedestal rests, 
with a scroll case on top.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The oppressive heat is a design of 
the room and should be an indication of the 
inhospitable conditions. While there is no illusion, 
detect magic reveals faint illusion magic on the 
walls and pedestal. This is meant to distract visitors 
and the GM should play up the illusion’s design 
with vague answers to the PC’s questions. Keep 
them in the room as long as possible, examining 
every corner.
With 1d6 minutes of examinations and a 
successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveal 
that no illusion actually exists and the heat is real.
Encounter Condition: Extreme Heat
Tactics: The scroll case is the only thing of interest in 
this room and touching it triggers a fireball trap that 
engulfs the room.
 '
Fireball Trap. When the cap of the scroll case is 
placed upon any surface other than the case itself 
it casts a fireball spell at 3rd level at its location, 
with a spell save DC of 14. Should the trap trigger, 
the scroll case is destroyed, along with the trap, 
and scroll if its still inside. A successful Intelligence 
(Arcana) check (DC 16) reveals the fireball spell’s 
runes etched into the cap’s rim. This trap may be 
disarmed by casting dispel magic on the scroll cap. 
Should the PCs succeed the Intelligence (Arcana)
check by a substantial amount you may opt to reveal 
the exact nature of the trigger, and that the trap and 
case might be saved for later use.
Seventy-two hours after being triggered and 
disintegrating the scroll case manifests again in the 
room, armed, and with a fresh fire trap scroll inside.
Treasure: Coincidentally, the scroll inside the case 
contains a stronger version of this rooms trap, a 
scroll of fire trap.
Fire trap is a variant of the alarm spell, with the 
twist that triggering the associated alarm casts 
the fireball spell at 3rd level at its location, with a 
spell save DC of 14. It requires a successful DC 16 
Wisdom (Perception) check to spot. Succeeding 
a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals the 
magical phrase to disable the fire trap for 5 
minutes. When spoken within earshot, the alarm’s 
trigger cannot activate for that time. Once triggered 
the trap cannot cast fireball again.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the trap and scroll to cast flame strike. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, change 
the trap and scroll to cast burning hands.
B19 . ROOM OF ROT
The door to this room is locked, requiring a 
successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check 
to unlock. When a PC opens the door they are hit 
with a stench of decay that requires succeeding a 
DC 12 Constitution saving throw, lest the PC become 
poisoned. After that, the Stagnant Air condition takes 
effect if the PCs enter the room.
This room reeks of decay. The smell is 
overpowering, practically debilitating and the room 
is cramped. The stone walls are covered in decaying 
moss and dark stains. Across from the door, a 
pedestal stands with an ornate scroll case on it. 
As enticing as the scroll case may seem, the stench 
threatens to completely overwhelm you.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Like Room B18, this room suffers from 
an unexplained odor that chokes the PCs as they 
enter. The stench is actually a design of the room 
(or a malfunction of the magical wards), not residue 
from the trap located on the pedestal. It would be 
easy to say this room is an anomaly, but this entire 
Region plays upon the experimental traps to the 
point that nothing should shock the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: Aside from the Stagnant Air, the PCs also 
have to deal with a trap if they wish to remove the 
scroll case from the room.

134
 '
Noxious Vapor Trap. The scroll case has two caps, 
one on each end. Of the two, one spins freely, as 
if it wants to be opened, popping off easily and 
triggering the trap. The other produces a grinding 
sound when spun and can be depressed as well 
as pulled off. PCs that succeed a DC 10 Wisdom 
(Perception) check hear a soft click when pressing 
down on this cap.
If this cap is depressed while opening the other 
the trap is disarmed permanently. Opening from 
this end still triggers the trap.
Removing the case from the room without 
disarming the trap triggers a noxious vapor that 
floods the room, poisoning any PCs inside that 
fail a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Once 
triggered the scroll case melts into a puddle of goo, 
ruining the scroll if it is still inside. After 72 hours 
have passed since it was triggered the scroll case 
manifests once more on its pedestal, loaded with a 
new scroll.
Treasure: The scroll case contains a scroll of 
stinking cloud.
B20 . LIMESTONE CAVERN
As the PCs approach this room, they can see water 
making out from under the door. The door to this 
room is locked, requiring a successful DC 25 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.
The entire floor of the room is submerged. Looking 
about, you notice the lack of construction here. The 
walls are unfinished limestone and stalactites hang 
from the ceiling. Droplets of water fall from the 
high ceiling, and the walls are slick. Almost floating 
on the water, resting on a stone, is a gem set into 
the wall, pulsating with a bright-yellow glow.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The entire floor of this room is sunken 
and filled with 4 ft. of water, which is icy cold. A 6 
in. lip runs the course of the room, but standing or 
walking on it requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check or the PC 
falls into the water. Falling into the water causes 
no damage, but it is extremely cold. Light does not 
penetrate the water either, but cupping it into one’s 
hand reveals that it is crystal clear. The bottom is 
uneven and rocky, making it difficult to cross easily.
Encounter Condition: [Extreme Cold], Flooded, 
Hazardous Footing 15
Tactics: Touching the jewel casts lightning bolt at 3rd 
level towards the PC. Due to the flooded condition 
of the room, the Dexterity save DC is 16. This 
happens only once, and dispel magic will remove the 
hostile enchantment without harming the item.
Treasure: The gem is a beautifully cut diamond, 
worth about 2,000 gp. While it does not radiate 
magic it grants resistance to cold damage, so long 
as the gem is held tightly in one’s hand. It can be 
safely removed once the trap is disabled.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the lightning bolt spell to chain lightning. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the DC of Dexterity  
save of the lightning bolt trap by 4.
B21 . COLUMNS
The door to this room is locked, requiring a 
successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check 
to unlock.
Stone columns run from floor to ceiling. The 
columns are carved with symbols from an ancient 
language you can’t quite discern, as well as graffiti 
left behind by the vagabond goblinoid races. The 
rapid scrawling of goblins and the heavier script of 
bugbears can be easily discerned. The columns in 
the back of the room are in better condition than 
the ones closest to the door. The floor of the room 
is littered with debris and small rocks.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The carvings on the columns depict 
the story of how the Region was built from the 
perspective of a scholar. It is a signature (of sorts) by 
one of the celestial designers. The graffiti covering 
the columns was created by the goblins and 
bugbears, and in a way details their history, though 
it is difficult to read as they often overlap and 
obscure each other. To ensure the room remained 
a testament to their work, the celestial incorporated 
a trap into the columns. Apparently, the goblinoids 
have not been deterred from spoiling the unique 
architecture of the columns, trap or no. The PCs 
may freely examine the columns, so long as they do 
not touch them. Once a column is touched the trap 
triggers and the columns collapse on the PCs. The 
trap resets once the room is void of life.
 '
Collapsing Columns. While appearing steady, the 
columns are packed with magic and ready to fall at 
any moment. Any touch of a living creature triggers 

135
their descent. Creatures within 5 ft, including the 
offending creature, must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or be struck by the stonework 
launched at them. Creatures that fail their save 
receive 4d8 bludgeoning damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs spend 30 minutes searching the 
debris in this room, allow each of them a DC 17 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to find one of the 
following: 24 copper coins in a brown leather bag, a 
gold ring that radiates illusion magic but produces 
no effect, a masterwork silver dagger, a pair of 
rusted kukri, or a scroll of mending. Once all four 
items are found all the PCs find are pieces of wood, 
bone fragments, stones, and fungus.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have a wall of the room collapse inward instead, 
striking all creatures within 10 ft. of that wall. To 
decrease the challenge, have the column instead 
drop a large brick from the ceiling, only striking the 
triggering creature.
B22 . DIRE WOLF DEN
This room is dark, so dark in fact that your torches 
cannot pierce the gloom. The few things you can 
makeout are merely shadows dancing in the corner. 
The smell of decay fills the air.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The PCs have stumbled into another 
dire wolf den. Four dire wolves are on edge 
due to recent goblin raids, and are prepared for 
any intruders that enter their den. The wolves 
gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, 
attacking the PCs on sight.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Deep 
Darkness, Fearless
Tactics: The wolves use pack tactics, swarming 
over one PC at a time. They do not target any PC 
specifically, attacking whichever is most accessible. 
Two wolves attempt to flank the target, while the 
others assault the PC directly. Attempts to sway 
the animals through Animal Handling are done at 
disadvantage.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two dire wolves. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one dire wolf.
B23 . THE PIT
A deep, circular pit dominates the center of this 
room. Leaning over it, you can see nothing but 
darkness down the treacherous well. The corpse 
of a bugbear lies against the northern wall, a 
gleaming battleaxe clutched loosely in its hand. In 
the other corner of the room, sunk halfway through 
the floor, is a sword. The echo of the wind gushing 
through the pit makes an ominous sound as you 
move cautiously about the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: There are two pits in this room. The first 
is obvious. The second is located directly behind 
the sword; it has become lodged between the two 
sections of the trap’s door. Unless they disable 
the trap first, any PC that steps within 10 ft. of the 
sword triggers the trap and they fall down into 
the 20-ft-deep pit. A successful DC 17 Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check is required 
by any PCs who fall down the pit to escape from it.
PCs that roll higher than a 14 on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks in this room notice seams 
in the floor that a slight breeze wafts through. 
Disabling the hidden pit trap requires sabotaging 
the seams around the edge of it, performed by 
succeeding a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check with the right tools.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The axe the corpse of the bugbear is a +1 
greataxe that always glows with a 5 ft. radius of dim 
light. No effort, physical or magical, succeeds in 
snuffing the light. If the PCs manage to recover the 
sword, it is a bastard sword, with the name Urthieln 
engraved in the blade (in Celestial runes).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the depth of the hidden pit trap to 30 ft. 
To decrease the challenge, lower the DC of the 
climb by -4.

136
B24 . BLOCKED HALL
You see a collapsed door in the distance. It 
appears as if a large stone block fell from the 
ceiling and utterly crushed it. The ceiling, however, 
looks complete and lacks any distinguishing 
characteristics. The hallway branches both east and 
west in front of the door.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The PCs are near one of the celestials’ 
observatories. In order to safeguard their private 
enclosure, the celestials installed a trap here. The 
trap only has one activation left and the goblins 
know to avoid it, having seen its devastating effect 
before. The eastern branch of the corridor leads 
to Room B22. The western branch terminates at 
a blank wall. A DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check reveals a small (3 in. diameter, 3 in. deep) hole 
in the wall (part of a secret door leading to Room 
B25) 4 ft. from the floor.
 '
Falling Block Trap. When the PCs enter this room 
have them roll a Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Anyone who rolls higher than an 8 notices 
primitive markings across the various tiles that 
make up the floor. PCs that roll higher than a 
14, or possess knowledge of goblinoid customs, 
find a pattern amongst them. It is spaced evenly 
enough to be walked by small folk. Straying from 
this path triggers the trap. If the PCs do not find 
the path, each roll 1d6. On a roll of 1-4 they have 
triggered the trap. Triggering the trap causes a 
huge block to fall from the ceiling, crushing any 
PCs who fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw for 6d4 
bludgeoning damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The secret door can only be opened by 
placing a dowel or iron rod into the hole in the 
wall and lifting up. No Strength check is required. 
Without a handle to lift, the PCs must succeed at 
a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check to lift the secret 
door open.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the falling block trap to 6d6. 
To decrease the challenge, lower the damage to 6d3.
B25 . OBSERVATORY
The secret door leading to this room can only be 
opened by placing a 3-in.-diameter dowel or iron 
rod into a hole in the wall 4 ft. high and lifting. No 
Strength check is required. Without a handle to lift, 
the PCs must succeed at a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) 
check to lift the secret door open.
A few nondescript wooden benches are in the 
room. On the back wall a large map hangs limply. It 
looks old, though it is in good repair. The map details 
the layout of this entire section of the dungeon. 
There is a simple stone door to the south.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was used as an observatory 
by the celestials. Aside from the map (see treasure 
below), it contains nothing of much interest or 
value. The air in the room is dry and fire spreads 
easily, consuming the benches and map within 
minutes if the fire cannot be extinguished. The 
door to the south leads to Room B26. It is locked, 
requiring a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
(DC 16) to pick. The doorknob is covered in a thin, 
almost imperceptible, layer of contact poison. It 
must be dealt with if the PCs wish to open the door.
 '
Contact Poison. Touching the poison causes near-
instantaneous burning and vicious nausea. The 
victim loses 1d6 hit points immediately, and must 
succeed a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose 
another 2d6 hit points every 10 hours until their 
next long rest.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The map on the back wall is a duplicate 
of Map B. It can assist the PCs in navigating the 
dungeon. It is quite old, and easily catches fire if 
the PCs are not careful. It is also large, measuring 
10-ft-by-10-ft The map does not show the location 
of secret doors, but it does show the location of 
every room in the dungeon. It is unlabeled.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
raise the DC of the Constitution save of the trap by 
5. To decrease the challenge, reduce the poison’s 
recurring damage to 1d6.

137
B26. OBSERVATORY LIBRARY
As you enter the room you notice it is similar to one 
of the rooms near the dungeon’s entrance. Along the 
back wall is a stone desk and chair, and a bookcase 
covers the eastern wall. In this room, however, the 
bookcase holds a number of tomes, not just one or 
two. A sheaf of papers lies on the desk, and the light 
glints off of something metallic under the chair.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The room is essentially a mirror of 
Room B3. The anteroom (Room B25) served as an 
observation post for the celestials, while this room 
was used to catalog their findings. The catalogued 
observations are stored on the bookshelf, written on 
ancient parchment. Not wishing for their records 
to fall into the wrong hands, this room was trapped 
by the celestial observers. The shiny object under 
the chair, which appears to be a silver brooch, is the 
trigger for a fire trap (see Room B18). Any attempt to 
move the broach triggers the trap, which destroys 
every book in the room beyond any hope of repair; 
the flames easily consume the ancient pages. The 
trap is also triggered if the PCs attempt to remove 
any of the books from the room without first 
disabling the trap.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs do not trigger the trap, they are 
free to take as many books with them as they can 
carry. The books, and the sheaves of paper on the 
desk, chronicle events of the devils over centuries, 
though no specific dates are given. To understand 
the writing, a PC must speak Celestial and succeed 
a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation check). The PCs 
are free to take the silver broach, which is worth 
approximately 100 gp, once the trap is disabled. If 
the trap is triggered, the broach is destroyed in the 
ensuing flames.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the fire trap to cast flame strike at 6th level. 
To decrease the challenge, change the fire trap to 
cast burning hands at 2nd level.
B27. HALL OF VINES
This room is covered in vines, lending it an earthy 
smell. Beneath the plants, you can barely make out 
a series of strange stones. The room is separated 
into three square sections and a layer of ash 
blankets the granite floor tiles. In the center is a thin 
pedestal with a bright gem affixed to it. The pedestal 
has strange sigils carved into its base, though they 
appear worn down and cannot be clearly read. The 
only apparent exit is the door you entered through.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The sigils under the vines, and on the 
pedestal, are glyphs of warding (3rd level, explosive, 
acid). If the PCs touch any wall, or the gem on the 
pedestal, the ward triggers, which withers the vines 
and ivy that have accumulated in the room over 
time. Each wall has its own ward, and each must be 
disabled individually to investigate the sigils.
Encounter Condition: [Safe]
Tactics: There is a secret door in the southwestern 
corner of the room that leads to a corridor which 
leads to Room B29. A successful DC 25 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check reveals a small, rough “button” 
that blends in with the stone. However, a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check dislodges the 
button from the surrounding moss and vines, 
without damaging the mechanism or triggering the 
glyph. Once the button is depressed, the wall slides 
down and into the floor, which also deactivates 
the glyphs for 6d10 seconds before the secret door 
closes again, and the traps reset.
Without the button, disabling any glyph of 
warding here requires a successful Arcana (DC 15) 
check, or just triggering them. The resulting acid-
blast only harms the vines... and the PCs who 
bumble into them.
Treasure: Once the trap on the pedestal is disabled, 
the PCs can remove the gem. It is a small sapphire 
worth approximately 600 gp. A PC spending an hour 
deciphering the sigils on the wall is rewarded a spell 
(that can be transcribed into a spellbook) if they 
succeed a DC 23 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The 
GM should choose an appropriate 3rd-level spell the 
PCs are lacking.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the glyph of warding trap 
to 7d8 acid. To decrease the challenge, lower the 
damage to 4d8 acid

138
B28 . EXCAVATED ROOM
The walls of this room are heavily damaged. Large 
sections of masonry are scattered all over the floor, 
and a few blunt pickaxes are left in the rubble. The 
room is musty and uninviting. 
If the PCs have not killed Bartleby the Halfling, read 
the following:
From the northwestern corner of the room you hear 
grunts and scratching. As you get closer the noises 
stop and the raspy, uninviting voice yells out, “Git 
outta here! This is my claim!”
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Bartleby the Halfling has taken up 
residence in this room. If the PCs have encountered 
him previously, his attitude is Indifferent, though 
he is gruff and suspicious. He presumes the PCs are 
following him, hoping to find the treasure he seeks 
before he can. If the PCs have not encountered 
Bartleby before, he questions them intently, trying 
to determine their purpose in the dungeon. He 
is elusive with his answers, and does not give his 
purpose away. If the PCs do not attack Bartleby, he 
claims the room is empty and has no more secrets 
to be uncovered and leaves, heading towards Room 
B38. He wants nothing to do with the PCs and 
offers no assistance nor accepts any in return. Once 
Bartleby leaves the room, or has been killed, the 
PCs can investigate further. Bartleby has destroyed 
the surface of the walls. The innards of a trap can 
be seen in the northern wall, but it is obvious that 
Bartleby has ruined it beyond repair. A successful 
DC 23 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check reveals the 
trap was once a fire trap (Room B18), but otherwise 
it is unidentifiable. On the southern wall is a 
secret door that leads to Room B29. It is difficult 
to spot, requiring a successful DC 19 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check to find. Like the secret door 
in Room B27, a simple button lowers the door into 
the floor for 2d6 rounds, during which time the trap 
that used to be in this room would be disarmed. 
Despite the damage to the wall, the secret door 
opens easily.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Concealment, Cover
Tactics: Bartleby attempts to scare off the PCs. 
He uses alchemical substances to distract them, 
such as acid, alchemical fire, and thunderstones 
(thrown weapons, dexterity to hit, deals 3d4 acid/
fire/thunder damage to creatures within 5 ft. of 
the target if it hits. DC 12 Dexterity saving throw 
halves the damage). If he cannot drive them from 
the room he flees deeper into the dungeon. Once 
in the dungeon, he heads towards Room B38. He 
knows the dungeon far better than the PCs and 
easily loses them once free of the room. Feel free to 
play this out, however, with Bartleby heading into 
trapped rooms and sneaking through secret doors.
Treasure: Bartleby keeps a bedroll, a small lamp, and 
a few pots and pans. However, any belongings of 
value are on his person.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter 
use the improved versions of Bartleby’s rogue 
abilities listed under “Difficulty Increase.” In 
addition, you may have Bartleby throw his 
alchemical weapons as a bonus action if you’d like.
B29 . THE ROOM OF WANDS
This room’s walls are covered with wands. Each one 
looks masterfully crafted. You can’t see any hooks, 
so magic must be holding the wands to the walls. 
The walls behind the wands are covered with thick, 
green moss. The floor and ceiling are free of the 
moss, and are polished blue marble.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Another in a series of maddening traps 
designed by the celestials, this room only has one 
useful wand: a wand of burning hands. The rest of 
the wands, while nicely crafted, are simple wooden 
decoys with an illusory magic aura. If the PCs cast 
detect magic, everything in the room radiates magic 
and every school of magic is present. PCs who roll 
higher than a 15 on Intelligence (Arcana) checks 
made to study the wands see through the illusory 
magic schools, and discern the wands to be all 
illusion magic. This reveals nothing further about 
them, just that the schools of magic they were 
enchanted with were fake. PCs that touch these 
fake wands who have proven themselves sufficiently 
chaotic or evil (or who bear those alignments if you 
prefer) have bestow curse (spell save DC 14) cast on 
them at 3rd level, choosing a random ability score 
to curse, and lasting for 24 hours.
The true wand is basically impossible to find 
amongst the multitude without testing each one. 
It is up to your discretion for how to handle that. 
Sufficiently stubborn PCs could brute force the 

139
hundreds of wands to find it. If a PC can see magic, 
and succeeds at a DC 15 (21 if they have yet to 
properly discern their spell schools) Intelligence 
(Investigation) check they find the odd one out.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The northern wall contains a secret door that 
leads to Room B28. A Wisdom (Perception) check 
rolls of 17 or greater within the room reveal the well 
hidden door. It is unlocked and opens easily.
Treasure: The PC can retrieve one wand of burning 
hands. It has 1 charge and casts at 3rd level.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
allow PCs to trigger the curse regardless of 
alignment. To decrease the challenge, change the 
bestow curse to bane. The duration and spell save DC 
remain the same.
B30 . GOBLINOID REMAINS
The moment you enter this room you find the 
remains of seven goblins and three bugbears 
littering the floor. From what you can discern, two 
scouting parties encountered each other here and 
laid waste to one another. Broken clubs and spears 
are strewn amongst the corpses and the scent 
of death hangs heady in the air. A bone-chilling 
screech suddenly echoes throughout the halls. 
Something is heading your way.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The scent of death has attracted two 
vargouilles to this room. Roll for initiative, the PCs 
have 24 seconds before they arrive. The PCs can 
choose to lay in wait for the vargouilles or they can 
flee. When the vargouilles arrive they notice PCs 
who are not hiding instantly. They attack the PCs on 
sight, hoping to add to the pile of corpses already 
in the room.
Encounter Condition: Cover
Tactics: The vargouilles assault the PCs with 
diving attacks. They rely heavily on their shriek 
attack, which can paralyze the PCs. They attack 
any paralyzed PCs, using their poison and kiss 
attacks on them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one vargouille. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one vargouille.
B31 . THE ROD IN THE ROCK
A squat stalagmite sits in the center of this coarsely 
carved room. The atmosphere is dank, but not 
overwhelming like some of the other rooms in the 
dungeon. Protruding straight up from the center of 
the stalagmite is a carved staff of dark stained oak. 
The top of the staff is fitted with a gleaming steel 
cap in the shape of an eagle claw.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A quarterstaff is buried in the stalagmite, 
and it serves as the trigger to the room’s trap. 
Pulling the staff before the trap is disarmed triggers 
it, flooding the room with darts that shoot from 
recesses in the wall.
If the PCs disarm the trap, they can attempt 
to remove the quarterstaff; a DC 20 Strength 
(Athletics) check is required to free the quarterstaff 
from its prison. If the PC performing the check 
has proficiency in Animal Handling, they gain 
advantage on the check.
 '
Spring-loaded Darts. When the staff is fully removed 
from the pedestal a spray of darts snap across the 
room. Starting from the east wall any creature not 
completely obscured by another must succeed a 
Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 2d8 piercing 
damage and be poisoned until their next long rest.
The trap-holes can be found with a DC 16 
Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled with 
a DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand). Undoing this 
mechanism leaves the darts open for the taking. 
The first time a dart deals damage it loses its 
poison and poisons the damaged creature if they 
fail a DC 14 Constitution save.
Encounter Condition: [Safe]
Tactics: The only door to this room is a secret door 
that closes 2d6 rounds after it opens. Opening 
the door from this side requires a DC 23 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. This DC increases 
by +5 if the PCs triggered the trap.
Treasure: The staff is indeed magical. A PC that 
retrieves it is the proud owner of a +1 defending 
quarterstaff. Defending items grant +1 AC to their 
wielder while they aren’t wearing armor.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the dart trap’s poison with exhaustion. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the DC for finding 
the trap by -4.

140
B32 . BLINK DOG DEN
As soon as you step into the room you are met 
with a chorus of growls. Four golden dogs, fangs 
bared, stare at you. You have obviously intruded 
upon their home, and you are not welcome here. 
Curiously, they make no move to attack you, as 
they wait for you to exit on your own.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The PCs have entered another blink dog 
den. The blink dogs (hit points 35, 31, 28, 23) do 
not appreciate the PCs’ presence and want them 
out of the room. They bare their fangs and growl 
at the PCs. However, due to their nature, the blink 
dogs do not attack the PCs; they only wish to scare 
them away. If the PCs make no move to leave, the 
blink dogs slowly advance on the PCs, hoping to 
drive them off. If any PCs attack the dogs, they 
immediately retaliate. Successful Wisdom (Animal 
Handling) (DC 14) checks calm the dogs for 2d6 
minutes. Success also allows the PCs to remain and 
investigate the room, though the blink dogs are 
obviously not happy with the PCs’ presence. Failure 
of this check changes the blink dog’s attitude to 
Hostile; they do not like being manipulated. There 
is a secret door on the west wall, leading to Room 
B31. A successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check reveals a hollow stone that can be pried open 
with a successful DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check. Once the hallowed stone is open, the PCs 
can see a lever that must be turned 90 degrees 
clockwise.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If attacked, the blink dogs launch themselves 
at the PCs, focusing on the most aggressive PCs 
first (or in the case of a PC failing a Wisdom 
(Animal Handling) check, they are focused first). 
They concentrate their attacks, targeting one PC at 
a time. They use their blink ability to flank the PCs. 
Because of the nature of the dungeon, their blink 
ability is sporadic and has a 70% chance of failing. If 
successful, however, they flank the hapless PC.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one blink dog. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one blink dog.

141
B33 . BUGBEAR STORE ROOM
This is a simple granite room. Along the northern 
wall is a plain rack, covered with spears and a few 
clubs. The weapons are too large for goblins, or 
smaller creatures, so this is most likely a storeroom 
for the bugbears in the dungeon. The room does not 
seem to have been visited lately, and the hallway 
outside is as quiet as a tomb.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears used this room as a 
makeshift armory for a while. Although they rarely 
come here now, there are spears and greatclubs 
stored on weapon racks. To protect their cache, 
the bugbears have rigged a simple spear trap, 
which is easy enough to spot. Stepping within 5 ft. 
of the weapons rack triggers the trap unless it is 
first disabled.
 '
Crude Spear Trap. Any PC rolling higher than a 12 
on a Wisdom (Perception) check in the room easily 
spots the spears under tension near the rack. These 
spears spring forward if the trigger (a weave of 
wooden poles hidden under a hide on the floor, 
spanning the 5 ft area in-front of the weapon rack) 
is activated. Disarming it is as simple as knocking 
each of the two spears over, where their springs 
worthlessly engage and disarm themselves. PCs 
that fail to notice the spears or charge in heedlessly, 
thus triggering the trap, must succeed a Dexterity 
saving throw (DC 15) or receive 1d8 piercing damage 
per spear remaining.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The PCs have their choice of four 
longspears, two greatclubs, one large warhammer, 
and one shortbow. Upon inspection, the weapons 
are simple and sturdy, but hardly special.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the crude spear trap fire four spears. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the damage of the 
spear trap to 1d4.
B34 . SHRINE OF THE WARRIOR
Moss covers the walls and ceiling of the room. 
Against the eastern wall is a statue of a hobgoblin. 
The statue holds a gleaming short-sword in its 
right hand, and a sharp looking ax in its left. The 
overall pose gives you a sense that this was a 
mighty warrior, and this is hallowed ground.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: As the statue suggests, this room was 
converted into a shrine by the hobgoblins of the 
dungeon. Since the hobgoblins no longer inhabit 
this Section, this room has been abandoned. While 
the weapons are fitted snugly into the statue, they 
can be removed with minimal effort by the PCs. 
This requires a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check for 
each weapon. Any attempt to remove the weapons 
triggers a deafening alarm. But, with no hobgoblins 
in the vicinity, no one responds.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 2
Tactics: After the PCs trigger the alarm in this room, 
roll for two Random Encounters, and resolve them 
soon, but still somewhat apart.
Treasure: The ax in the statue’s left band is 
a +1 battleaxe and the sword in the statue’s right 
hand is a +1 shortsword.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
after the PCs trigger the alarm, roll for three 
Random Encounters, spaced 6d6 seconds apart. To 
decrease the challenge, remove the alarm.

142
B35 . THE PEDESTAL
Brightly polished marble tiles are intricately 
arrayed on the floor of this room. Dark granite 
walls and a high limestone ceiling frame it. A large 
pedestal with a bright red, velvet cushion placed 
upon it, sits majestically in the center of the floor. 
The floor surrounding the pedestal is covered with 
a tile mosaic that depicts a giant snake eating 
its own tail.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whatever purpose this room once served, 
or what the pedestal held, has been lost. The room’s 
defenses, however, are still active. Any PCs that 
touch the pedestal trigger a hail of needles trap.
 '
Hail of Needles. When the pedestal is touched, 
a room-wide trap triggers. Slots in the ceiling 
drop fistfuls of needles into the room. Creatures 
within the room with no way to take cover (shields, 
helmets, nearby larger PCs) receive 1d8 piercing 
damage. From then on, every 5 ft. moved within the 
room deals another 1d4 piercing damage. This trap 
does not reset for a few weeks.
The mechanism can be spotted with a successful 
DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and 
disabled by succeeding a DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Whatever was on the pedestal is no longer 
there, and the pedestal contains no secret 
compartments. Invisible symbols have been drawn 
on the top of the pedestal, however, but these can 
only be found with detect magic (though once seen 
remain visible), which reveals a series of arcane 
marks, laid out in a replicating pattern. A DC 15 
Arcana check reveals that the sigils hint to a riddle 
or answer to a riddle. The PC may study the symbols 
for 1 hour, requiring another DC 20 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check success to maintain concentration 
that long. If successful, the arcane marks explain 
how to open the secret door leading to Room B55.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the hail of needles trap to the raining shards 
trap in Room B5 (with the trigger changed to the 
pedestal). To decrease the challenge, have the trap 
only deal its damage for every 10 ft. of movement.
B36 . WOODEN CAGE
The floor, walls, and ceiling of the room are covered 
with wood paneling. The paneling is smooth and 
even, but the smell of dry rot permeates the air. 
There is no discernable damage, however. Sitting in 
the middle of the room is a burlap sack. Gold coins 
spill out of the top of the sack and litter the floor 
around it. As you make your way towards the sack, 
the door behind you slams shut, sealing you in.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Similar to the Hall of Mirrors (Room B6), 
this room was designed by the celestials as a test of 
the prisoner’s intelligence. A sack, resting on a giant 
pressure-sensitive trigger, serves as bait. Anyone 
who steps within 10 ft. of the sack also steps on 
the trigger, and the trap activates. Once the trap is 
activated the door slams shut and is impossible to 
open without resetting the trap.
The reset mechanism is located behind a 
wooden panel in the northeastern corner. The 
panel must be removed carefully to reset the trap; 
if not, the PCs have another danger to contend 
with. Noxious gasses have built up behind the 
rotting wood and the PCs must take the proper 
precautions when removing the panel, or they’ll 
flood the room with the toxic gas. The panel isn’t 
hard to find. While its purpose is not clear, PCs 
should be made aware of its existence when they 
start searching the room.
When pried open the gases inside burst forth. 
A DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) lets a PC reach 
in and flip the release lever once per hour. Each 
hour the gasses take their toll, dealing 1d8 poison 
damage to all creatures in the room if they fail a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw. PCs reaching for 
the lever take double damage as they get a face full.
When the door opens the gasses quickly vent 
into the hallway and the room becomes safe again.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The sack contains ten vials of holy water, 
which prisoners might find useless but the PCs may 
be able to put to use.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the trap into an acid fog, dealing 2d8 acid 
damage each hour. To decrease the challenge, lower 
the DC of the Constitution save of the trap by -2.

143
B37 . TRAPPED HOWLERS
As the PCs approach the door to this room, read the 
following.
The stone door in front of you doesn’t look right. 
All the other doors you have seen so far have 
been flush with the surrounding walls. This one, 
however, looks slightly cocked, as if it has been 
jammed shut. Loud whining howls pierce through 
the stone door, flooding the area directly in front 
of it with a cacophonous noise.
If the PCs put their ear to the door, they hear the 
moan of the howlers, forcing them to make DC 12 
Wisdom saves or be frightened of the howlers for 1 
minute. The door to this room has been locked and 
the lock damaged by rough hands. A DC 20 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check is required to open the door. 
After the PCs open the door, read the following.
As you open the door the noise grows louder as a 
pair of beasts jump from the shadows. The beasts 
resemble spiny-backed hounds, which are hard to 
make out due to the thick smoke filling the room. 
Your curiosity is cut short as the beasts lunge in 
your direction.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A party of bugbears has trapped two 
howlers inside the room. They also left a fire 
burning in the center of the room in the hopes of 
suffocating the howlers. Sadly, the bugbears do not 
understand that howlers are not mammals from 
this plane and thus not subjected to the same laws 
for breathing. The howlers have not been trapped 
for long, but they are nevertheless eager to depart. 
As soon as the door is opened they rush in, hoping 
to escape. With the PCs in their way, however, they 
turn their attention to them, violently taking out 
their frustrations on the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Smoke
Tactics: The howlers attack the closest PC first, 
latching on with their jagged teeth. They thrash 
about, impaling the PC on their quills. The howlers 
fight ravenously for 2d4 turns, at which point they 
get their wits about them and fight more sensibly, 
flanking the PCs.
Treasure: Once the PCs have dealt with the howlers 
they are free to inspect the room. Aside from 
scratches on the walls, obviously the work of the 
trapped howlers, there is nothing of note. The wood 
in the center of the room has been smoldering 
for some time, however, blanketing the contents 
in ash. Allow the PCs DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) 
checks to locate a silver dagger, in the corner of the 
room, coated with ash.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one howler. To decrease the challenge, remove 
one howler.
B38 . RUINED OBSERVATORY
The door to this room has been smashed open, its 
remains strewn about the doorway. The interior is 
a now-familiar sight. The room contains a simple 
stone desk and chair, and a bookshelf against the 
back wall. A large pile of books lies in front of the 
shelf. An ear-piercing whine sounds from within the 
pile, and you spot a strange-looking lizard, with a 
triangular head, rifling through the refuse.

144
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room is identical to other celestial 
observatories, the major difference being that 
something has found it and ruined it. The ethereal 
marauder chanced upon the room and is tossing its 
contents, turning over books and chairs.
The ethereal marauder may not notice the PCs 
as they enter the room, busily digging through the 
room’s contents (suffering a -2 penalty to Wisdom 
(Perception) checks). If the PCs remain in the room 
for more than 30 seconds allow the marauder 
another Wisdom (Perception) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the ethereal marauder notices the PCs, it 
becomes startled and attacks. If the PCs attack it 
before it notices them, the ethereal marauder flees 
immediately.
Treasure: The books in this room are ruined. While 
they are mostly journals and textbooks, they offer 
no insight into what the celestials had observed 
from this room. Allow the PCs a DC 25 Intelligence 
(History) check to uncover information about the 
maze in Room B92. If successful the PCs uncover 
details about its twisting, impossible passages and 
the deadly nature of the maze. Despite its dangers, 
demons trying to escape the prison would run 
through the maze, quickly losing their bearings.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one ethereal marauder. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the ethereal marauder’s hit 
points by 5.
B39. HALL OF THE HOBGOBLINS
The door leading to this room is locked, requiring a 
DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock it If 
the check fails by more than 10, roll a d20, on 1-3 the 
thieves’ tools are jammed in the lock and ruined.
Rotted benches and tables fill this cavernous space. 
The floor is littered with scraps of cloth and bone, 
as well as less inviting piles of refuse. Something 
used this room as a meeting place or base of 
operations, but it hasn’t been used in quite some 
time. At the back of the hall, against the northern 
wall, is a large stone throne and dais.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Before the hobgoblins joined forces with 
their goblin cousins, they made their home here. 
While they have long since abandoned this room, 
some of their belongings, shortspears, and clubs 
scattered amongst the refuse and debris, remain. 
They also left behind the throne of their chieftain, 
and it still sits on its dais under a thick layer of dust.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions
Tactics: After the PCs spend 30 minutes in this room, 
roll for a Random Encounter.
Treasure: Hidden in the throne, behind a secret 
panel, is a +1 greatclub. A DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check is required to find the panel, 
while a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check 
opens it. Scattered around the room are twelve 
javelins, two spears, six clubs, 14 arrows, and six 
poisoned arrows (basic poison).
Scaling: N/A
B40. HALLWAY
If you do not want to alert the PCs to the trap in this 
hallway, do not read the following.
You find yourself in a simple hallway. The walls and 
floor are smooth, and nothing is very out of the 
ordinary. Something prickles at the base of your 
neck, however, as things may not be exactly as they 
appear. At the far end of the hallway, you can hear 
a dull, roaring sound, like howling wind.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A well-camouflaged pit lies in wait for 
any PCs traversing this expanse of a hallway. If the 
PCs travel more than halfway through the hall, they 
trigger the trap, falling into the 50 ft. deep pit.
PCs that roll higher than a 14 on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks in this room notice the 
suspicious nature of the floor. Each step is much 
more hollow than usual, the gaps where they 
shouldn’t be, etc. Disabling the trap requires 
wedging the hidden hinges along the sides of the 
walls, by succeeding a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check with the right tools.

145
While intended to be a smooth deathtrap, time 
and nature have worn the pit enough to allow PCs 
to climb out, should they survive the fall.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 10
Tactics: At the east end of the hallway is a spotless 
room. On the west end is an open door leading 
to Room B41.
Treasure: At the bottom of the pit are a few piles of 
broken bones, one of which still clutches 3d6 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
trigger the trap on a failed Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check. To decrease the challenge, reduce the 
pit depth to 30 ft.
B41 . HOWLER DEN
The door to this room is open. If the PCs fell into the 
pit in Room B40, then the howlers hear them coming 
and are not surprised, taking cover in the room. 
Otherwise, the howlers make Wisdom (Perception) 
checks at advantage for the purposes of the PCs 
sneaking up on them.
As you approach the open door, deep growls 
escalate from inside. Something lives here. 
If the PCs succeed at DC 13 Perception checks, read 
the following.
Peeking your head in, you see three hounds, with 
fibrous quills on their backs.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The PCs have entered a howler den, 
although (fortunately) the entire pack is not nearby. 
There are normally as many as ten pack members, 
but presently there are only three howlers. As soon 
as the PCs enter, the howlers unleash their mighty 
howls, wasting no time forcing the PCs from 
their sanctum.
Encounter Condition: Fearless, [Safe]
Tactics: The howlers attack as a pack, lashing out at 
the nearest PC and dragging them to the ground. 
If a PC presents themself as the biggest threat, 
the howlers deal with him first. The howlers bite 
the PCs, latching on with their jagged teeth. Once 
engaged, they use their quills to entangle their 
opponents.
Treasure: A small nest lies in the corner, against a 
stone that is slightly warmer than the others. In 
the nest are the remains of an elf skeleton that 
stumbled into this lair some 5 years ago. The bones 
have been thoroughly gnawed on and the finger 
bones lay about the nest. A golden ring can be 
found in the nest with a successful DC 16 Wisdom 
(Perception check). The ring is worth only about 
25 gp but has the name Ellinorith written on it. 
Ellinorith is an elven deserter and should the PCs 
mention the ring or his name to the elves in Region 
H, they confer that he got what was coming to him.
If the PCs investigate the stone, allow an 
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check (DC 15) check to pull one of the bricks from 
the wall. Some kind of tool will be needed. A thin 
piece of metal works, but shimmying it between 
the mortar takes some time. Once removed, the 
PCs find a piece of amber that gives off heat in a 
5 ft, radius. The heat is around 110 degrees and is 
perfect for putting under a blanket or in the bottom 
of a pot to heat water. The amber never stops 
radiating heat.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one howler. To decrease the challenge, remove 
one howler.
B42 . WELL OF HEALING
The room looks much like the others in this expanse 
of the dungeon but the floor is littered with rubble 
and rocks. At the back of the room is a simple stone 
well. The rope attached to the well’s frame extends 
straight down and is taut.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The well contains a small treasure and 
the room is designed to prevent anyone from 
retrieving it. The rubble on the floor shows the 
aftermath of the trap, and it is the only clue the PCs 
have regarding the nature of the room. The trap is 
triggered when the handle on the well is turned. 
Triggering the trap unleashes stone blocks from the 
ceiling, which fall down on the PCs. The trigger is 
located in the well itself, a discolored stone on the 
backside of the well marks the trigger location.
Triggering the trap causes a huge block to 
fall from the ceiling, crushing any PCs who fail a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw for 6d4 bludgeoning 
damage. This trap resets in 2 minutes.

146
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Once the trap is disarmed, the PCs may 
haul up the bucket attached to the bottom of the 
rope. There is no water in the bucket (as there is no 
water at the bottom of the well), but it does contain 
three vials of shimmering blue liquid. Smart PCs 
should realize this is a great place to store supplies. 
Someone, perhaps Bartleby (Room B28), figured 
out the trap and placed the vials here for future use. 
The PCs should feel confident few people know how 
to get past the trap and can thus store items here 
safely. If the PCs store anything in the bucket, there 
is an 85% chance the items will be here when they 
return. For each week that passes, roll again for 
these items.
Treasure: In the bucket are three vials; each is a 
healing potion.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the falling block trap to 6d6. 
To decrease the challenge, lower the damage to 6d3.
B43. THE MASHER
The floor in this room is scuffed and heavily 
scratched. Aside from that, it is empty, framed by 
unmarked granite walls. Off towards your right is a 
simple wooden door leading to another room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: While the room is empty, it is not without 
its perils. The walls conceal poisoned spikes that 
only trigger when the door to the adjoining room 
is opened. Once triggered the spikes spring out of 
the northern and southern walls, and the northern 
wall slowly moves toward the other. In addition, 
the doors to the south shut and lock, requiring a 
successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 17) check 
to pick. If the PCs trigger the trap it is still possible 
to reset it while it is moving, but the difficulty 
is increased. When the PCs disable the trap or 
manage to get the door open, they can enter the 
adjoining room to the east, which contains the 
remains of a few elves who died in here. The GM 
should feel free to give them a full complement of 
equipment though.
Encounter Condition: Negative Energy, Stagnant Air.
 '
Masher. When the handle to the door to the 
adjoining room is pulled the north and south walls 
sprout 1.5 ft. spikes and begin moving. Both doors 
close and lock if they were not already, sealing the 
PCs in. The mechanism swings with such force 
that any creature caught in the doorway is shoved 
inside. Once the room is sealed the walls slowly 
begin to push together, stopping only when they 
are 3 ft. apart.
A maintenance panel is hidden next to the 
door on the east wall, requiring a successful DC 15 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to find. When 
rolling Perception checks in the room take note of 
any PC that rolls greater than a 12 or 15. Those who 
roll a 15 or greater notice the trap box immediately. 
Similarly, those who roll a 12-14 notice the box, but 
only when the walls start moving. The soft clink 
and hum of gears inside giving the hidden panel’s 
position away.
Disabling the trap is only a matter of jamming 
the gears. PCs may attempt Strength (Athletics) 
(DC 14) with appropriate items to achieve this. 
Succeeding will halt the walls. Alternatively, a 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check may be attempted 
to tamper with the reset timer. The PCs get one try 
at it, taking the roll, reducing it by 5 (10 if the trap is 
in motion), then multiplying it by 3. That amount of 
minutes is taken off the 1 hour reset time.
Touching the spikes at any point deals 2d6 
piercing damage, and poisons creatures who do not 
succeed a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.
If an enterprising PC wishes to test their 
strength against the walls: A contested grapple 
check using Strength (Athletics) is performed 
against the wall. It possesses a strength score of 26, 
adding +13 to its check to contest the grapple. If the 
PC manages to succeed, the wall is halted for 3d10 
minutes, while the reset timer continues to run.
Each grapple attempt applies the spike damage 
twice as the grappler contends with not only the 
mechanism, but the barbs pressing against them.
Encounter Condition: [Negative Energy], 
[Stagnant Air]
Tactics: Once the walls press together, there is a 3 ft. 
gap from one to the other. They remain pressed 
together for 1 hour, during which time the PCs 
must succeed a Constitution save (DC 10, +1 per 

147
previous save) every 10 minutes to stave off the 
strain of balancing, or buckle and lean momentarily 
against the poisoned wall spikes (suffering damage 
each time).
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the trap’s damage by 1d6. To decrease the 
challenge, decrease the trap’s damage to 1d6.
B44. DEAD WORGS
This large room is nearly empty. The walls are black 
and gray, and very clean. However, three massive 
blood-covered wolves lay over the corpses of two dead 
dogs. Blood mats their hair and stains their mouths. 
Their skin is black and much of their hair has been 
singed. The heavy smell of burnt flesh fills the air.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The PCs have stumbled upon a trapped 
room that worgs and dogs were fighting in before 
triggering the fire spray trap. The trap is very potent, 
but with the dead bodies, easy to spot. However, 
if the PCs stumble upon the trigger without being 
careful, they suffer the same fate as the creatures.
 '
Fire Spray Trap. When triggered, a tiny hole in the 
wall flips open and releases a gout of alchemist’s 
fire. A cone of rapidly igniting liquid chars 
everything in its path. Creatures within the room 
must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or 
take 5d6 fire damage. The trap resets in 5 minutes.
Tactics: The trigger for this trap is a single small stone 
set in the floor 6 ft. from the door, shaped like any 
other in the room. Careful PCs can easily avoid 
and disable it by wedging something underneath. 
Wisdom (Perception) checks that roll a 16 or higher 
notice scuff marks on the edges of adjacent stones 
that reveal its ability to move. The corpses are three 
worgs and two blink dogs that fought in this room, 
before one tripped the fire spray trap, killing them 
all. If the PCs clear the air of smoke, avoid the 
trigger (or disable it), and bar the door, the room is 
considered Safe.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
remove the bodies and add an empty backpack in 
the center of the room as a lure. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the damage of the trap to 3d6.
B45. THE GOLDEN IDOL
This large room is lined with bright, shiny steel. 
Light bounces off the steel in every direction, 
blinding you. On columns throughout the room are 
ledges lined with lit candles. In the center of the 
room, on a simple wooden table, is a golden idol. 
The figure is about three feet tall, ornately carved, 
and resembles a beautiful angel, holding aloft a 
torch. The room gives off a peaceful feeling, as if it 
was a shrine at some point.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The idol is a tribute from one celestial 
to another; it honors the celestial’s sacrifices in 
constructing and defending the dungeon complex, 
though this is not readily apparent to the PCs. 
Inscribed on its base is a message (in Celestial). “In 
darkness, I bring light, never straying from my path.” 
Removing the idol from the table triggers a trap.
 '
Chaotic Lightning Trap. Upon a platform sits a 
pedestal, with an idol upon a pressure plate. The 
PCs should be made aware of the plate moving as 
they take the idol unless they rush it. If 35 lbs. (half 
the weight of the idol) is removed from or added 
to the pressure plate under the idol, the trap casts 
a lightning bolt spell at 3rd level at the platform. 
Creatures that fail their saving throw against this 
are knocked prone. Once the spell resolves the 
bolt ricochets off the steel walls 1d4 times, striking 
the PCs once more each time. Prone PCs have 
advantage on Dexterity saving throws to avoid this 
trap, and take no damage on a success. The trap can 
be disabled by correctly weighing down the pressure 
plate. Lawful good PCs (or those you feel exemplify 
the alignment’s values) are immune to the damage 
of this trap.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 5, Positive 
Energy, [Safe]
Tactics: If the PCs extinguish all the candles, the torch 
on the statue lights up, casting the daylight spell 
at 3rd level. This is true anytime the statue is taken 

148
into a dark room. This effect cannot be controlled 
and only turns off when there is a light source 
nearby. This room has an undoubtedly mysterious 
air to it. The GM should feel free to add whatever 
elements are lacking to keep the PCs in this room, 
examining every nook and cranny. If the PCs never 
disturb the idol, the room is considered Safe.
Treasure: The golden idol weighs about 70 lbs., and is 
worth approximately 1,000 gold pieces.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, change the chaos 
lightning trap to cast chain lightning and decrease 
the 1d4 ricochets to 1d2. To decrease the challenge, 
reduce the damage prone PCs take by half.
B46. BUGBEAR FORWARD POST
A crude map of the dungeon, written in rough, 
goblinoid script, is on the southern wall. It marks the 
locations of various rooms, and the rune for goblin 
is repeated over and over on its surface. Standing in 
the center of the room are three tall goblinoids, with 
sharp fangs and heavy coats of fur. They are armed 
and angry, roaring with a defiant battle cry.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The PCs have stumbled upon a secret 
staging area of the bugbears, hidden among the 
trap-infested rooms of this section. Safe from their 
goblin enemies, they plan their attacks from here. 
This room provides easy passage to an expanse of 
claimed rooms (B1 through B45), but also to the 
last remaining bugbear stronghold (rooms B52 
through B68).
The room is currently occupied by three 
bugbears. If the PCs make any sound opening the 
door the bugbears gain advantage on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks. If the PCs go unnoticed allow 
the bugbears a second check after thirty seconds. If 
the bugbears notice the PCs, they become incensed 
by the intrusion and attack.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 2
Tactics: Caught off guard, the bugbears assault the 
PCs ferociously. The bugbears work individually, 
attacking the PC closest to them. While it is possible 
to parlay during battle, the bugbears are more 
concerned with silencing anyone that would report 
this room back to Argliss (Room B75).
Treasure: While there is no treasure, per se, the 
map drawn on the wall can easily be copied onto 
parchment, giving the PCs a much-needed help 
navigating the Region. A door near Room B6, 
to the north, is circled and marked (in Goblin), 
“Kneed Kee.” If the PCs spend an hour transferring 
the map to paper, give them proficiency in 
Dexterity (Stealth, Sleight of Hand), Wisdom 
(Perception), and Inteligence (Investigation) checks 
made anywhere in the Region. This map lacks 
Rooms B55, B57, and B59 through B62. PCs that 
have the map from Room B25 notice this after 
spending 2 hours comparing the two maps; or 
in 1 hour if they succeed at a DC 18 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one bugbear. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.
B47. CHAMBER OF ECHOES
Sounds echo from the walls of this vacant room. 
A series of noises follow giving the impression 
that footsteps are simply more unnatural sounds 
originating from this room. Human wailing 
surrounds you. Hanging from the ceiling is a rusty 
sword tied with a length of rotting rope.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The sword is a trigger for a crawling claw 
trap. If the PCs find a way to remove the sword 
and replace its weight with something else on the 
rope, they can disable the trap. Otherwise, the trap 
triggers as soon as the PCs lower the sword.
 '
Crawling Claw Trap. The trap is the rope itself. 
Enchanted with necromancy, it brims with latent 
magic, dying to be unleashed. It glows with a pale 
light when viewed by those with magical sight. It 
otherwise presents as mundane. Removing the 
sword without tying another object to the rope 
triggers the trap. Once triggered, 2d4 crawling 
claws burrow out from under the various stones, 
each echoing the alien sounds as they attack.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Echoes 10
Tactics: No sounds actually originate from this room, 
but instead are amplified from other Regions in the 

149
dungeon. This room has become a nexus for noise 
and the PCs are actually hearing conversations and 
battles going on in Regions E, G, I, and N.
Treasure: The sword is a featherweight longsword 
that needs to be cleaned and sharpened but 
otherwise has survived the ravages of age. The word 
“sanctify” is written along the blade in Celestial. 
Featherweight weapons weigh half that of weapons 
of the same type (in this case longswords), gain 
thrown (range 20/60), and use their versatile 
damage dice even when wielded with one hand.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add 1d4 crawling claws to the trap. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, halve the number of 
crawling claws created by the trap.
B48. RIDDLE ROOM
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 15 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open.
Along the western wall of this room is an immense 
red tapestry, covered in silver and black arcane 
sigils, The cloth is silk, and in perfect condition as if 
untouched by the passage of time. On the floor are 
a series of tiles: white stones, mixed with red bricks 
and onyx plates. On the south wall is a strange 
diagram showing the layout of the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is a complex puzzle requiring 
the PCs to make some intelligent decisions. 
ln order to reach the tapestry, the PCs must 
successfully navigate the tiles. The tiles are laid 
out thusly:
The diagram on the wall is wrong, designed to 
encourage interlopers to miss the order in which 
they stand on the tiles. PCs succeeding at a DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check or DC 15 Wisdom 
(Insight) check are able to read the notes and 
decipher them accordingly.
According to the diagram, the PCs must step on 
the tiles in the order:
White. Red, Black, Red, Black,  
White, Red, Black, Black, White.
This of course is wrong and only if the PCs 
succeed at a DC 28 Wisdom (Insight) check 
or a DC 25 Wisdom (Survival) check can they 
determine the pattern is illogical and based on their 
knowledge of traps a trick. While this does not help 
them determine the actual order they know the 
diagram is incorrect.
In actuality, it doesn't matter what color they first 
stand on, but once a tile is touched, only that tile 
color should be stepped on (by that PC) from that 
point on. Reaching each stone of that color without 
touching any other stone requires succeeding a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, unless the PC chose 
the red bricks which are narrower and require 
successful DC 18 Dexterity saving thows. If a PC 
takes the shortest route, they can clear the room 
in six jumps, reaching the tapestry on the other 
side. Longer routes take up to ten jumps, but all of 
them lead to a single 3-ft-wide bronze plate on the 
floor. The plate, which is below the tapestry is safe 
for the PCs to stand on, no matter what color tile 
they chose.
Encounter Condition: [Poor Footing 3]
Tactics: If the PCs step on the wrong tile, they suffer 
a small discharge of energy from the tile based on 
the color of a tile. 
Stepping on a red tile out of turn, reduces the 
PC's speed by 5 ft. until their next long rest.
Stepping on a white tile out of turn deals 1d4 
fire damage.
Stepping on a black tile out of turn poisons the 
PC unless they succeed on a DC 13 Constitution 
saving throw.
Treasure: Although it radiates no magic of any 
kind, if the tapestry is pulled from the wall and 
wrapped around a humanoid, it forms into a +1 
ghostly scale-mail, which permanently fuses to the 
wielder's body. It is not uncomfortable, able to 
be slept in and worn with little issue. Its ghostly 
nature makes it practically weightless. Anything 
short of dispel evil and good (break enchantment), 
or the wish spell, cannot remove the armor. 
Despite its weightlessness, it is quite loud and 
still manages to restrict movement, inflicting all 
the penaltieswearing scale mail would. wearing

B49-B68 . THE BUGBEAR ENCAMPMENTS
For centuries, the bugbears dominated the other 
goblinoids in the Region. Neither the goblins nor the 
hobgoblins could match the ferocious attacks and 
cunning tactics of the bugbears. Where once their 
domain was extensive, the alliance of the goblins and 
remaining hobgoblins, coupled with the zealous new 
outlook the goblins wield, has driven the bugbears 
back to these few rooms in the western section of 
the Region.
During their reign of dominance, the bugbears 
spent a fair amount of time dismantling many of 
the celestials’ traps. They took advantage of the 
damage the earthquake did to the Region. 
A few of the more complex traps were left 
standing, as the bugbears could simply not 
fathom how to disable them. The de-
stroyed traps have been replaced by sim-
pler ones of the bugbears’ design, which 
they can reset and modify as they see fit.
The intimate knowledge and ever-changing 
array of traps have kept the bugbears safe in 
this domain, their final refuge. The tactics and 
numbers of their enemies may thwart them in 
the rest of the Region, but here on their home 
turf, they control the field and eagerly look 
forward to the day the goblin empire topples 
and they can reclaim their former greatness.
It is possible, however unlikely, for the PCs 
to gain the trust of the bugbears and ally 
themselves with them against the goblins and 
hobgoblins. This is quite difficult to accomplish 
as the bugbears view the PCs as yet another 
faction vying for power in the Region. If the 
PCs can gain the trust of the bugbears, they 
gain allies who know the Region very well and 
have the power to make the PCs’ trek through 
the Region much easier. The simplest way 
to gain the bugbear’s trust is to show them 
the bodies of slain goblins. Deeds, not words, 
have the best chance of swaying the bug-
bears here.
There are surprisingly few bugbears in these 
encampments. Many are off on sorties against the 
goblin empire. The few that remain plan new raids 
and repair the traps they have laid for the goblins.
If the bugbears believe the PCs are allied with 
the goblins, however, they will not give the PCs any 
chance to prove otherwise.
the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, the armor fades into a red mist and reappears on this wall as a 
tapestry again.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, the penalty for red tiles should stack 3 times. The penalty 
for white tiles should have its damage increased to 1d8. And the penalty for the black tile should inflict 
exhaustion instead of poison.

D20encounter
1
This section of the dungeon is unnerving. It could be the air, or the shadows, or the way the sound 
plays off the walls, but something about this area is disturbing. [Haunted].
2
The sound of heavy footfalls echoes throughout the dungeon. A group of bugbears are out hunting 
goblins, or anything else invading their space. The PCs must succeed at three DC 14 “Stealth” checks. 
These are not normal Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and are not contested rolls. If the PCs choose to 
spend extra time by not moving from where they are, they should have advantage on these checks, 
and should not suffer armor disadvantage. If they fail any of the checks, they encounter the bugbears, 
as if a 19 had been rolled on this table.
3-12Nothing.
13
A stone block falls from the ceiling, striking a random PC for 4d6 bludgeoning damage unless they 
pass a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Allow one PC a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 17) to spot the 
brick before it has a chance to harm anyone.
14
A pack of 1d4+2 worgs wander the dungeon. They are not hunting the PCs, and have only a 25% 
chance of noticing them. If the PCs do not wish to confront the worgs, they must succeed at a 
DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid being noticed. If the PCs elect to stop for a time, grant them 
advantage on those checks, and remove armor disadvantage for them.
15
A pair of bugbears are resetting a scything blade trap (see room B1). The PCs notice the bugbears first 
if any roll higher than a 15 on a Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the bugbears get the drop on 
them. Whichever side loses this is surprised.
16
See 13, but instead of falling of their own accord the stone pieces are attached to a tripwire. 
Depending on the party’s formation more than one party member can be hit. The blocks now strike 
1d4 party members and deal 6d6 of damage on a failed saving throw.
17
A group of three ethereal marauders turn the corner and face the PCs. They are startled by the PCs’ 
presence. They have a 50% chance of fleeing outright. Otherwise, they are Unfriendly to the PCs 
unless attacked.
18
The PCs chance upon a violent skirmish between the bugbears and goblins down the hall. 3d6 
goblins are engaged in furious combat with 2d4+1 bugbears. One of the goblins spots the PCs and 
both groups strike out and turn their attention to the PCs.
19
The noises of the PCs have attracted the attention of a nearby bugbear patrol. Impose a -2 penalty on 
the PCs’ Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the bugbears before they attack. The party is made up 
of 2d4+1 bugbears armed with short spears and swords. Aughkin (Room B62) leads the patrol.
20
Bartleby (Room B29) is inspecting a portion of the wall here. He seems intent on his work and 
doesn’t look up as the PCs arrive. Bartleby suffers a -4 penalty to his Wisdom (Perception) checks for 
30 seconds.
B49. SANCTUM
The door to this room was locked, requiring a 
Dexterity Sleight of Hand check (DC 19) to pick open.
This hidden room is in good repair. A simple desk 
and chair, and a large oak bookcase are the only 
furnishings. The desk is empty, but a number of small 
bottles are scattered over the shelves of the bookcase.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears never discovered the secret 
door in Room B51. They don’t know this place exists, 
leaving it free from their stench. Surprisingly, there 
are no traps or enchantments here, and Wisdom 
(Perception) checks of 15+ give an overwhelming 
confidence that the room is free of danger.

152
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: Used as a sanctum years ago, the room is a 
perfect hiding place for the PCs. The time it takes to 
complete short or long rests here is halved, owing 
to the surprising comfort... or perhaps some celes-
tial enchantments.
Treasure: N/A

B50. SECRET CHAMBER
As the PCs near the secret door on the eastern wall of 
Room B59, read the following.
A sliver of light spills out into the hallway from a 
crack in the wall.
As the PCs near the secret door on the western wall 
of Room B50, read the following.
A sliver of yellow light spills out into the hallway 
from a crack in the wall. Grunting sounds can be 
heard from behind it.
Finding the secret door requires a DC 15 Intelli-
gence (Investigation) check and a DC 15 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to slide it open. A small, 
rough stone doubles as a handle, allowing the PCs 
to simply lift the door open. The secret door on 
the western wall is jammed and requires a DC 14 
Strength (Athletics) check in addition to the Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check.
As the PCs enter the room, read the following.
An oddly shaped room opens. In the middle of 
the room, set into the northern wall, is a stone 
door. The room contains no furnishings other 
than a stack of four strongboxes, one on top of 
the other. Wherever the sound was coming from is 
gone for now.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is more of a causeway, used 
by the celestials to shuffle about behind the scenes. 
There is nothing here to explore (except the strong-
boxes), but opening the doors could prove a chal-
lenge to the PCs.
This room contains three hidden doors. Which-
ever one the PCs came through stays open for 2d6 
seconds before closing. After that, they can easily 
find and open the door again.
The door on the northeastern wall leads to 
Room B49 and requires a DC 25 Investigation check 
to find and a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check to open. The same is true of opening it from 
the other side. This secret door remains open for 
2d6 seconds.
The secret door on the southeastern wall leads 
to a long corridor and the secret door on the west-
ern wall opens into a north-south corridor (that 
leads to either Room B52 or B53). Finding either 
secret door requires a DC 20 Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) check and a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check to slide it open. A small, rough stone 
doubles as a handle, allowing the PCs to merely lift 
the door open.
The secret door on the western wall can easi-
ly be found from the inside but requires a DC 14 
Athletics check to open in addition to the Sleight of 
Hand check.
The door to the north is locked (from both sides) 
and requires a DC 22 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check to open. The small interior chamber leads to 
another, similar locked door that is also locked on 
both sides.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 6, Safe
Tactics: The sounds the PCs heard were the dungeon 
playing tricks on their ears. There is no one here, 
but when the doors are closed and the PCs stand 
just outside it seems like there is.
Treasure: All four boxes are equally weighted and 
none make any sound when shaken. The third 
strongbox, however, is the only one with anything 
in it. All four are locked.
Each strongbox requires a DC 27 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to open and each lock 
is trapped with a poison needle trap. If anything 
except a key is inserted, the needle springs forth, 
jabbing the intruder. Victims that fail a DC 13 
Dexterity saving throw take 2d8 poison damage and 
must succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or 
be poisoned. They are easy to spot and should only 
get the most careless of thieves. The mechanism 
will not reset automatically once fired.
In the third box, strapped to the inside of the lid, 
are five potions: healing (x2), resistance, sanctuary, 
and gaseous form.

B51. PRIVATE STUDY
The door leading to this room is locked, requiring a 
DC 27 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to pick.
This is a simply furnished room, with a small cot 
and a table. A tattered pillow and blanket rest on 
the cot, and both reek of mold and mildew. Upon 
the table is a shiny, gold ring and a hefty book.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Before the doppelganger Argliss took over 
the goblin empire, he made this room his home. 
Well hidden, it proved a solid base of operations 
to fall back to. While he spent years living here, he 
never returned after becoming king. Knowing his 
journal was safe, he left the room as it was, hoping 
one day to trap something with his ruse.
The ring on the table is rigged to explode, con-
suming the book in a blaze and harming those who 
trespass. It is rigged with a fire trap (Room B18).
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: If the PCs disable the trap on the ring (a hefty 
task), the ring and the book are theirs. The book is 
Argliss’ journal. It details his encounters with the 
halfling Bartleby (room B28). The doppelganger 
is quite upset with the loss of the artifact Bartleby 
seeks. Bartleby is allowed to keep any other artifacts 
he finds in the Region as payment, provided the 
artifact is returned to Argliss.
While it does not say anywhere in the journal 
that Argliss is a doppelganger, it does allude to 
strange circumstances where he is not always a 
goblin. Allow the PCs a DC 15 Intelligence (Histo-
ry) check or a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check 
to deduce he is a barghest. If they succeed at a 
DC 21 History check or a DC 25 Intelligence (Na-
ture) check, they realize he is not a barghest, but a 
doppelganger. The GM should make these checks 
secretly so the PCs don’t know whose informa-
tion to trust.
Treasure: The last page of the journal is a scroll of fire-
ball. The ring radiates strong transmutation magic 
and appears to be a ring of invisibility if the PCs cast 
identify on it. It is actually a cursed ring with several 
side effects. First, it causes the wearer to automat-
ically fail saving throws against the scry spell. In 
addition, the wearer can never turn invisible, no 
matter the strength of the spell. It also causes the 
wearer to be constantly under the effect of a zone 
of truth. Lastly, while the wearer’s alignment does 
not change, they cannot willingly violate any lawful 
good tenets, including killing innocents, betraying 
a trust, or deceiving a fellow man. While they don’t 
have to always behave “lawful good”, they do have 
to monitor more obvious actions. This powerful 
magic item was here when Argliss moved in and he 
never put it on, for fear of the celestial’s games.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the Investigation DC of the fire trap by +5. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the Intelligence 
(Arcana) DC of the fire trap by -5.
B52. STRAY DIRE WOLF
You hear a low, deep growl as you approach an 
open chamber ahead. A wandering dire wolf 
stalks the hallways, its hackles raised. It snarls 
at you, baring its fangs menacingly from the 
darkness ahead.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A lone dire wolf roams the hallways, 
apparently lost. It has been here for some time and 
grows more agitated as the hours roll on. When the 
PCs enter the room, the wolf attacks.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Fearless
Tactics: This dire wolf is fast and agile. Having 
roamed these halls for some time, it is worked up. 
The dire wolf gains the effects of the Mobility and 
Alert feats. In combat, it attacks the closest PC and 
continues attacking until it is subdued or the PCs 
are dead. It trips PCs on each attack, moving onto 
the next PC, once one is down. If two PCs are down 
at the same time, it takes a round to bite a prone 
PC before moving on. Wisdom (Animal Han-
dling) checks involving the beast are performed at 
disadvantage.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one dire wolf. To decrease the challenge, re-
move the benefit of the Alert and Mobility feats.

154
B53 . THE RESERVOIR
Towards the back of this large room is a low, 
circular well. The well’s placement is reminiscent of 
a town square fountain. The principle difference is 
that the well has no discernable bottom. In front of 
the well is a small sack with gems spilling out of it.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whatever the original purpose of the 
room was has been lost. Now, the bugbears use 
this room to dispose of captured goblins and other 
creatures, having placed the gems here to lure 
goblin patrols. Lifting the sack triggers the pres-
sure-sensitive plate (which can be noticed by rolling 
higher than a 15 on a Wisdom (Perception) check) 
underneath. When triggered, the door to the room 
seals and it rapidly floods to a depth of about 4 ft. 
This is ultimately harmless, but after 3 minutes the 
room begins to drain. 
PCs must succeed two consecutive DC 14 
Strength (Athletics) checks or be sucked down the 
50 ft. drop into the well. The trip is rough and deals 
2d6 bludgeoning damage as they strike the walls 
on the way down. Climbing out is difficult but not 
impossible, requiring a successful DC 17 Strength 
(Athletics) check to perform well, otherwise they 
incur a level of exhaustion. Enterprising PCs might 
trigger the trap again to force a stuck PC out.
The door to the room has a stubborn seal that 
can be defeated with a wedge of some variety and 
a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics), or a DC 18 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Unsealing the 
flooded room drains its contents into the nearby 
area and breaks its mechanism for good.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the room’s drain timer from 3 minutes to 
6d20 seconds. This is rolled each time the room is 
triggered. To decrease the challenge, reduce the DC 
of the Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) checks by -5.
B54 THE BUGBEAR PACK 
LEADERS' HALL
This massive room is furnished with hides and 
skulls, trophies of a more prosperous time for the 
bugbears. The walls are rough, and covered in crude 
runes and hairline cracks. The floor is stained badly, 
and littered with scraps of bone. In the middle of 
the room is a squat, wide table with a large map 
placed on it. Around the room are four bugbears. 
The largest snarls at you and reaches for his club.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Unless the PCs have spoken with Aughkin 
(Room B62) the three bugbears in this room attack 
the PCs without hesitation. If the PCs have spoken 
with Aughkin, the bugbears’ initial attitude is Un-
friendly instead and they do not attack the PCs.
While the bugbears’ attitude is Unfriendly, the 
PCs can negotiate with them, deferring to their 
leader, Sharpfang. Sharpfang is particularly ornery 
and pays the barest amount of lip service to Augh-
kin’s “presumed” status within the encampment. 
He humors the PCs to increase his own stature and 
gain respect from his fellow bugbears.
His knowledge is limited to the goblin and 
bugbear war. Sharpfang does not give the PCs 
any insights about traps or what to expect in the 
dungeons. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Insight) 
check reveals that Sharpfang does not care if the 
PCs fall victim to the traps in the dungeon or not. 
He could give the PCs valuable information, but he 
chooses not to.
Sharpfang and his raiding party created the map 
on the table. It details the bugbear encampment 
and the goblin empire (Rooms B52 to B91). While 
it’s marked with dots and splotches, the placement 
is incomprehensible to the PCs. Only Sharpfang is 
sure what the markings mean, and he refuses to tell 
them. If the PCs call him on this refusal to help, he 
gets angry. If they continue to push, he attacks.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: Sharpfang attacks the strongest PC, while his 
subordinates watch his flank, striking any PCs who 
get near him.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one bugbear. To decrease the challenge, 
remove two.

155
B55. A BLACK PEARL?
The secret door leading to this has not been found in 
centuries. The PCs must succeed at a DC 25 Intelli-
gence (Investigation) check to find this secret door. 
It is completely flush with the stone and even if they 
know it’s there, they only gain advantage to locate the 
groove in the wall. If successful they pry open a 4 ft. 
wide door that allows access to the room.
This room is cramped due to a large pedestal that 
takes up the center of the room. The top of the 
pedestal is covered in black velvet. Nestled in the 
center of the velvet is a single, flat black stone. 
Oddly, there is no dust in the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: If the PCs aren’t paranoid about the traps 
in this Region, they haven’t tried hard enough. 
Chances are they believe the stone is trapped, 
seeing it resting on a pedestal, unguarded. In fact, 
it is not. The PCs merely need to walk up and lift 
the stone from the pedestal. But they don’t have to 
know that.
Encounter Condition: [Drafty]
Tactics: If the door to this room is left ajar, it creates 
a draft that sweeps through, threatening to blow 
out torches.
Treasure: The pearl on the pedestal is actually a bead 
of force. It lacks the ability to trap creatures inside its 
radius, instead dealing an extra 8d8 radiant damage 
on impact.
Scaling: N/A
B56. THE BUGBEARS' WORKSHOP
A large workbench stretches along the northern 
wall. Tools lie haphazardly on top of and 
underneath it. Shelves lying against the western 
wall contain scraps of iron, brass, and copper. Off 
in a corner of the room are piles of leather and rope.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whether it is a new spear or a piece of 
a deadly trap, if the bugbears need it they make it 
in this room. The tools are hanGMade and crude, 
but they serve their purpose. The bugbears are not 
master craftsmen by any means, but they do good 
work and their cunning in devising traps has served 
them well. At the moment, the room is empty, but 
the bugbears in Room B57 are busy at work.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 2
Tactics: If the PCs succeed at DC 21 Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks, they hear grunts coming from the 
other side of the wall. While the secret door here is 
not obvious, there is enough of a gap for sound to 
come through.
The secret door leads to Room B57 and requires 
a DC 21 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find. 
It does not appear on the map in Room B25 and 
therefore the PCs do not get a bonus to find it. If 
the PCs make a great deal of noise, allow the bug-
bears in Room B57 Wisdom (Perception) checks to 
notice them.
Treasure: The workshop contains scraps of iron, 
brass, and copper as well as multiple shafts of 
wood. There is also a small pile of leather and rope. 
The tools themselves are worthless, simple things 
made for large hands.
Scaling: N/A

156
B57 . THE BUGBEARS' ARMORY
This room serves as the armory. Aside from the 
various weapons that adorn the racks and shelves 
in this room, you can’t help but notice a group of 
surly goblinoids, seven feet tall, and covered in fur. 
They are sorting through scrounged debris and piles 
of stones, as they look up to see you.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Unlike the majority of rooms in their 
domain, the armory of the bugbears is not aban-
doned. Three bugbears have just returned from a 
patrol and are sorting through some of the supplies 
they’ve scrounged (rope, wood, etc.). They do not 
take kindly to intrusions, especially in one of their 
hidden caches. If they do not hear or see the PCs 
coming, they are surprised, but ready for battle 
nonetheless.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The bugbears attack the closest PCs, and 
stay in a tight group. They use their size to their 
advantage and do everything they can to push the 
fight into the hall. Weak PCs are easy targets and 
the bugbears hurl whatever they can find at pesky 
spellcasters who launch spells from the back of 
the party.
Treasure: The armory contains a dozen short spears, 
three long spears, six short swords, eight great-
clubs, and an assortment of rope, stones, wire, 
wood, and anything else they could manage 
to scrounge.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add two bugbears. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.
B58 . SUPPLY ROOM
Empty barrels and empty shelves fill this room; 
a supply depot, in serious need of supplies by all 
appearances. Only scraps of iron and leather, and a 
few sticks, are currently in stock.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears store spare parts for their 
traps, as well as additional supplies for making 
weapons here. The current lack of supplies indicates 
how bad off the bugbears currently are in their 
campaign against the goblins.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The supply room contains scraps of iron 
and leather, as well as a few bundles of short sticks 
that could possibly be used for spears.
Scaling: N/A
B59 . SLEEPING QUARTERS
Various animal hides and blankets cover the floor. 
You get the impression this is a communal sleeping 
room for the remaining bugbears. The room feels 
safe and secure, and you can understand why the 
bugbears chose it. Fortunately for you, it is deserted 
at present.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears, when not out raiding, re-
treat here to rest. They have claimed a great number 
of safe rooms in their small domain, and use them 
to their advantage. Other than the animal hides 
covering the floor, this room is empty.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The animal hides on the floor could possi-
bly be used for barter, or the PC’s own personal use. 
Aside from those, the room holds no treasure.
Scaling: N/A
B60 . ENTRANCEWAY TO THE 
INNER SANCTUM
The secret door can be found by the PCs with a DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check. While the door is 
secret, it is also locked. Opening the secret door re-
quires a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to manipu-
late the hidden mechanism. Alternatively, the PCs can 
use Aughkin’s (Room B62) key, which requires them 
to encounter him as a Random Encounter.
Fine, almost powdery, rubble litters the floor of this 
room. Along the west wall are three separate doors. 
Based on the contents, it’s safe to assume this is a 
storeroom for the inhabitants of the dungeon.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears have utilized the resources 
left behind by the celestials well. They survive the 

157
vicious goblin attacks mainly because their guerrilla 
tactics and cunning make them hard to find. The 
lock on the secret door makes it more difficult still 
even for knowing goblins to enter. The bugbears’ 
private quarters are located off of this room. Even 
with the protection of a secret entrance, the bug-
bears take no chances. The rubble strewn about the 
floor of this room should tip off the PCs to another 
bugbear trap. Among the rubble is strung a web of 
tripwires. Triggering one drops a stone block from 
the ceiling, striking the offending PC for 4d6 blud-
geoning damage unless they pass a DC 14 Dexterity 
saving throw. A successful Wisdom (Perception) 
check (DC 17) to spot the tripwires.
Encounter Condition: Hazardous Footing 14
Tactics: If the PCs make too much noise here, roll for 
a Random Encounter.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the damage of stone blocks from the 
ceiling trap to 5d8. To decrease the challenge, lower 
the damage to 4d3
B61 . THE HEALER
This room seems out of place. While other rooms in 
this stretch of the dungeon are either wide, empty 
halls or small, cramped cells, this room is... cozy. 
A large goblinoid sits placidly in the center of the 
room, adding to the overall strangeness of the 
scene. His hair is white, perhaps from age, and his 
manner is calm and unobtrusive.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: This bugbear, known only as Healer, is 
quiet, serene, and imposing. Standing a full 7 ft. 
high, Healer is white-haired and appears very wise. 
The Healer is not typical of the bugbears by any 
means. He has lived long enough to understand 
that war between the goblinoid tribes is unneces-
sary, but an irrefutable fact of their heritage. He has 
resigned himself to seclusion.
He couldn’t care less about the PCs’ presence, 
but helps them out—giving them medicinal herbs 
to heal their wounds—if asked. The Healer does 
not “waste” magical healing on the PCs unless 
the PCs have proven themselves to be stoic allies 
of the bugbears first. He reserves his magic for 
his comrades, unsure of when the goblins could 
attack next.
The PCs can ask Healer about the bugbears; he 
answers their questions to the best of his abilities. 
He is tired of the war and simply wishes to be left 
undisturbed in his sanctuary. If the PCs are in the 
room for more than one hour, the Healer starts to 
get agitated and his attitude shifts from Indifferent 
to Unfriendly.
The Healer never attacks the PCs first. If the 
PCs attack him, however, he will do his best to 
subdue them.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 2, Safe
Tactics: The Healer calls upon his deity to protect him 
from the PCs, alternating between casting spells 
and attacking the nearest PC with his +1 morning-
star. He casts entropic ward before a fight breaks out 
and calm emotions once things get heated.
Treasure: The medicinal herbs Healer carries heal 
1d4+1 hit points each and he has enough medicine 
to make 2d12 doses for the PCs.
B62 . THE RETIRED PACK LEADER
Cramped and reeking of rotten meat, this small 
room is dominated by an aging goblinoid. Even 
seated, you can tell he is well over seven feet tall 
and a mass of fibrous muscles waiting to snap. His 
hair is gray and mottled, and deep scars line the 
bugbear’s face, chest, and hands.
If the PCs do not surprise the bugbear, add the 
following.
Staring at you from his perch, his one good eye 
searches deeply, curious about you. He seems to be 
having the same trouble reading you as you have 
reading him.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The creature in this room is a bugbear 
named Aughkin. He is old and of no use in raid-
ing parties. However, he has lived a long time, an 
indication of intelligence to this bugbear tribe. The 
others keep him here and rely on his wisdom and 
stories of past adventures to help plan bolder raids 
into the goblin expanses. While he would rather be 
in the thick of a raiding party, he is content to guide 

158
the younger bugbears to victory over the accursed 
goblins. He does not advise in matters he consid-
ers suicide, and whether the true leader or not, 
still treats his “men” with the dignity and respect 
due soldiers.
With a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check, 
the PCs can convince Aughkin they are not here 
to harm him or the bugbears. Aughkin and Heal-
er (room B61) are willing to hear the PCs out and 
perhaps reach an agreement, but this requires 
roleplaying, not die rolling, and ultimately is the 
decision of the GM. Should they reach an accord, 
word spreads amongst the bugbears that the 
PCs can be trusted and the two groups should 
work together.
If attacked, or enraged, Aughkin attacks the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: Aughkin would rather not fight, but he is not 
afraid of death. He has become a good advisor by 
thinking before he acts. If forced into battle, Augh-
kin does not hesitate, however. He launches himself 
at the PCs with a ferocity rarely seen in bugbears 
half his age. He gains the benefit of the barbarian’s 
Rage feature for the duration of combat, despite 
not being a barbarian, and grapples the nearest PC 
he can find. If he gets a PC on the ground, Aughkin 
grabs ahold of the PC’s neck and threatens to snap 
it if the others do not back off. Because of the size 
of Aughkin’s hands, he deals 1d4+1 bludgeoning 
damage each turn while successfully grappling.
Treasure: Aughkin does not keep anything in his 
chambers that does not serve him in warfare. 
Clothing and magical aid are given to his men and 
for himself, he’s kept a simple +1 dagger. If the PCs 
spend 30 minutes searching the room they manage 
to find an old journal (written in Goblin) that tells of 
his younger days as a soldier, and his recent years 
as a leader, unwilling to jeopardize his men.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two bugbears. To decrease the challenge, have 
Aughkin surrender if his grapple fails.
B63 . GOTCHA!
Stark, this room is nearly identical to many rooms 
in the dungeon. The one feature that distinguishes 
it however is an intricate pattern of tiles on the 
floor. The tiles are covered in a layer of dust, 
however, and it is difficult to discern anything 
specific about them. Hanging on the wall, across 
from you, is a finely crafted spear.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears like to capture the occa-
sional goblin, as they sometimes prove to be reli-
able sources of information. While the rest of the 
traps the bugbears have laid out in their domain are 
lethal, this room is not. Any goblins captured in this 
room are brought to Room B53 for interrogation.
The tiles on the floor are the trap’s trigger, an 
alternating black and white pattern (like a checker-
board). PCs stepping on black tiles trigger a large 
net trap while stepping on white tiles is safe. To 
disable the trap the PCs must find a specific black 
tile in the southwest corner of the room where 
the trap’s reset is located. Finding the tile is easy 
enough, requiring a successful Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) (DC 14) check. However, lifting the tile and 
disarming the trap is another issue entirely. There 
are a series of twelve buttons, in three different 
colors (black, red, white) that must be depressed in 
a specific order. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) check indicates that the buttons must 
be pressed in pairs. Failure on this check indicates 
that the colors are directly related to the tiles on 
the floor.
A second DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check indicates that the buttons must be pressed in 
order—red, black, and white. Failure on this check 
indicates the order is black, white, and red.
Lastly, the PCs are allowed a third check (this 
time at a DC 20) to determine the exact pairs that 
need to be depressed. If the PCs fail this check, they 
choose the wrong pair.
If a button is ever pressed out of order (or 
pressed in correspondence to the incorrect pair), 
the PC triggers a cantrip targeting the but-
ton-presser based on the color. The black button 
triggers a chill touch, the red button triggers fire 
bolt, and the white button shocking grasp. The can-
trips are cast as if by a 1st level.

159
 '
Large Net Trap. When triggered a room-wide net 
made of bundled wire descends from the ceil-
ing, catching all beneath it. PCs must succeed an 
Strength (Athletics) check (with a DC equal to their 
AC) for every 10 ft they wish to move underneath it. 
If the trap is disabled while it is active the net rises 
once more.
If more than 2 hours pass after the net is trig-
gered a patrol of 1d3 bugbears investigates.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs succeeding at a DC 20 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check realize that the mechanism for protect-
ing the large net is more complicated than the net 
itself, hinting that at one time the trap was more 
than just a net. Once the trap is disabled, the room 
is safe until the bugbears reset it (in 2d6 hours). It 
is recommended that the GM make the checks in 
private, lest the PCs get wise to the trap’s function.
Treasure: The spear is a featherweight spear. It is the 
bait by which all goblins are tricked into entering 
this room. PCs that lifted the special black tile are 
allowed Wisdom (Perception) (DC 16) checks. Those 
who succeed realize that the buttons are built into 
a locking hinge that hides a compartment under-
neath. If they successfully disable all three traps, 
they can lift the mechanism (requires succeeding 
a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check) to find a pair of 
magical daggers. One of the daggers is an angel-
bane dagger, while the other is a fairybane dagger.
Angelbane weapons are +2 and magical when 
used against creatures that speak Celestial. Fairy-
bane daggers are +2 and magical when used against 
creatures that understand Sylvan.
Featherweight weapons weigh half that of 
weapons bearing the same type, gain thrown (range 
20/60), and use their versatile damage dice even 
when wielded with one hand.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the large net trap to a camouflaged pit trap 
(Room B40). To decrease the challenge, change the 
large net trap to a portcullis trap.
 '
Portcullis Trap. When triggered a portcullis slams 
down in front of the exit. Creatures underneath are 
skewered and crushed and must succeed a Dexter-
ity saving throw (DC 13) or take 2d8 piercing and 
2d8 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, creatures 
that fail to save are pinned underneath, preventing 
movement until freed. Any creature that can lift 200 
lbs. of weight can reliably lift the gate 1 ft. off the 
ground, with the weight requirement doubling for 
each additional foot of distance desired. The gate 
will rise when the trap is reset.
B64 . A LONG WAY DOWN
This simple chamber is quite nondescript, except for 
a pair of high-quality long spears abandoned in the 
center of the room. Two gems, in the opposite wall, 
stare back at you, like a pair of red eyes.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Like Room B63, the bugbears set up a 
simple pit trap to snare goblin scouts. The long 
spears have been left to lure the unsuspecting 
goblins into a trap. If that doesn’t work, the gems 
in the wall will. The floor beneath the long spears 
(5-ft-by-5-ft square) can only support 10 lbs. before 
it opens, dropping the victim(s) into the 60 ft pit 
below if they fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A 
locking mechanism can be found, with a successful 
Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 15), behind a 
panel in the eastern wall. Once the switch is flipped, 
the doors to the pit do not open and the PCs can 
travel across the room safely.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The gems are only painted glass, designed 
to lure goblins across the room. They cannot be 
removed from the wall, short of a DC 30 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check. If removed, the bugbears 
replace them in 1d3 days. This trap is either an 
indication that bugbears aren’t very inventive or that 
goblins aren’t hard to trick.
Treasure: The two spears are normal spears, which 
the PCs are free to take once they have circumvent-
ed the trap. The gems are worthless glass.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the depth of the pit trap by 20 ft. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the depth of the pit 
trap by 20 ft.

160
B65. STORAGE
The door to this room is locked. A DC 25 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check is required to unlock it. 
The smell of death inside is evident before the PCs 
open the door.
As soon as you open the door, the smell of death 
assaults you. This small room has a pile of dead 
goblins, who are rotting. Flies and maggots fill the 
air, escaping past the PCs and into the open air. 
Stacked along the walls are all manner of wood 
beams, spikes, polearms, and tripwires.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is filled with the tools and 
equipment for making traps (not to mention a 
half-dozen dead goblins). It looks as though it is 
regularly used, but how the bugbears endure the 
stench is another story.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (mindfire) 12, 
Stagnant Air
Tactics: While mindfire is normally inhaled, if the PCs 
avoid touching the goblins, they gain advantage on 
the Constitution saves to resist the mindfire.
Treasure: If the PCs have the stomach for it, they can 
search the dead bodies, finding a total of 36 sp, 
14 cp, a key to the door in Room B80, and a po-
tion of jump.
Scaling: N/A
B66. BUGBEAR HIDEOUT
The door to this room is locked, requiring DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.
Unless the PCs succeed at a DC 25 Dexterity 
(Stealth) check while opening the lock, read the 
following:
This room is enormous. The vaulted ceiling and 
painted walls make this room appear larger than 
life. Standing, weapons at the ready, are eight tall, 
angry, grizzled goblinoids covered in mottled brown 
fur, their jagged teeth exposed.
If the PCs succeed in picking the lock quietly, read 
the following.
This room is enormous. The vaulted ceiling and 
painted walls make this room appear larger than 
life. Pacing about the room, sharpening weapons, 
and sifting through crates are eight tall, grizzly 
goblinoids covered in mottled fur, their jagged teeth 
exposed. They do not notice you.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly or Hostile
Encounter: Eight bugbears are using this room 
to plan a raid on the goblins. Normally, they are 
mobilized, moving about the halls, but these bug-
bears have a plan up their sleeves. They intend to 
gather their strength together, sneak through the 
maze (Room B92), and attack the sleeping goblin 
army from behind. By striking from the far end of 
the goblin empire, they hope to distract the main 
arm of the army and send a smaller force to kill 
the goblin king. If the bugbears do not notice the 
PCs, they continue planning their attack. However, 
every so often, allow one of them a Wisdom (Per-
ception) check to notice the PCs. If the PCs watch 
for too long, the bugbears assume they are spies 
and attack. If the PCs approach peacefully, however, 
there is an opportunity to work with the bugbears. 
Allow the PCs to role-play through the situation or 
use Wisdom (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) 
to diffuse the hostilities.
If attacked, or enraged, Oskin attacks the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: If the PCs try to strike a bargain with the 
bugbears, Oskin (the largest of the eight) listens 
to what the PCs have to say and, if he trusts them, 
invites them to help on the raid, asking them to 
attack from the north while they use the maze to 
disguise their approach. In combat, the bugbears 
fight to silence the PCs. Two rush to block the door, 
while the rest flank the PCs. Oskin directs the battle 
for two rounds before attacking the largest PC. 
They are tireless fighters and have no qualms about 
killing the PCs.
Treasure: All of the bugbears carry well-crafted weap-
ons and are prepared for battle. Oskin carries two 
potions of healing and a potion of the giant’s strength.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two bugbears. To decrease the challenge, 
remove two.

B67. THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE
This room is large and appears empty, but 
something about it bristles with menace. There 
are no signs of the goblins occupying this room, 
so it must still be in the domain of the bugbears. 
Why they have chosen to leave it empty is a 
mystery, however.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears have littered this room with 
as many traps as possible. If the goblins seek to take 
their final hidden refuge (Room B68), the bugbears 
plan on exacting a heavy toll.
Scattered around the room are six different 
traps, each placed in such a way that the PCs cannot 
avoid them all if they move between the doors on 
the western and northeastern walls. The GM is free 
to trigger as many or as few of the following traps 
as he likes.
The basic arrow and spear traps occur three times 
throughout the room and the dart traps occur twice.
 '
Spear Trap. Running perpendicular to the walls are 
3 spear traps with simple 5-ft. wide tripwires placed 
in their line of fire. Each launches its payload at the 
unfortunate PC who triggers it, dealing 1d8 damage 
if they fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Should 
they succeed, the next PC that would be behind 
them must succeed the save or be struck instead. 
Disarming it is as simple as knocking it over, where 
the tension will be undone safely.
 '
Poisoned Darts. Tiny clusters of darts sit loaded 
into a pair of crude launchers in each of the far 
corners of the room. When their awkwardly strewn 
triggers are depressed a spray of darts snap across 
the room. Starting from the east wall, in a 15-ft. 
cone pointing towards the center of the room, any 
creature not completely obscured by another must 
succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 1d6 
piercing damage and be poisoned until their next 
long rest.
The launchers can be found with a DC 13 In-
telligence (Investigation) check, and disabled with 
a further DC 9 Sleight of Hand check. Failing the 
check launches the darts. Undoing this mechanism 
leaves the darts open for the taking. The first time 
a dart deals damage it loses its poison and poisons 
the damaged creature if they fail a Constitution 
(DC 14) save.
 '
Swinging Block. Directly in the center of the room 
is a single 10-ft. tripwire that can be noticed if a 
PC rolls higher than a 14 on an Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) check. Triggering the trap causes a heavy 
stone block to swing towards the trigger’s location, 
requiring a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid. 
Failure to do so deals 3d8 bludgeoning damage. 
If the save succeeds, any creature occupying that 
space in the next few seconds must save again or 
take 2d8 bludgeoning damage as the block swings 
back through. This repeats once more, with one less 
damage die.
 '
Arrow Trap. Pointed randomly about the room are 3 
arrow traps. Within their line of fire are numerous 
crossed and web-like triggers. They are obvious, 
intentionally so, painted with bright colors. To navi-
gate their zone of fire PCs must succeed an Dexter-
ity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check (DC 15). 
No traps have triggers that intersect these as they 
are meant to drive victims into the range of the less 
obvious traps. Failure to avoid the trigger requires 
a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 1d6 
piercing damage. Disarming any of these traps 
requires simply knocking it over.
Tactics: The object of this room is to introduce the 
PCs to the traps of the Region. The bugbears are 
not likely to invite strangers in and this room is 
designed to encourage PCs to find another way 
in. Getting to Room B68, the PCs find it a dead-
end and now have to move across the room again. 
Unless 1d4 hours have passed since they moved 
through this room, the bugbears have not reset 
this trap.
Unlike other trapped rooms in this section, 
there are no dead goblins here. If the PCs enter this 
room from the secret door to the south, it is not as 
important to “hurt” the PCs with this room, since 
they are more than aware of the region’s dangers. It 
is recommended the PCs feel discouraged, but are 
not killed by this room.
The door to the south leads to a secret door that 
requires a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
to locate. The secret door is locked, but a simple 
DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check allows the 
PCs to spin the door open on its central axis.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, allow two traps to 
go off at the same time. To decrease the challenge, 
have each trap occur only once.

162
B68. REFUGE
Lined with empty supply racks, this room feels safe 
and secure. Currently, there is nothing in the room 
aside from the empty shelves.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: If the goblins ever overrun the bugbear 
encampments, the bugbears plan to fall back to this 
room. Guarded by the traps in Room B67, they can 
wage a war of attrition against the goblins to the 
very end. They know that if things become this dire 
they are doomed, but they plan on taking as many 
goblins as they can with them.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: If the PCs admit to the bugbears that they 
have entered the refuge, it shifts their attitude one 
step closer to Hostile. Once Hostile, the bugbears 
attack the PCs on sight in all future encounters, 
having spread the word.
Treasure: There are a few daggers, arrows, and the 
like, but nothing of value. Allow the PCs to resupply 
up to 1d20 arrows, bolts, darts, and 1d6 spears.
Scaling: N/A

B69-B91 . THE HOLY GOBLIN EMPIRE
These rooms encompass the might of the goblin em-
pire that has recently been forged by their new king, 
Argliss in the name of their new god.
Musty smells and dampness unknown in the rest 
of the dungeon fill the air here. The traps laid by the 
celestials still work, and the goblins learned long ago 
to avoid the rooms that contain them.
From these rooms, the goblins have unleashed a 
vicious war of conquest and retribution against the 
bugbears and rebel goblin faction. Had the hobgob-
lins not accepted the offer to join Argliss, no doubt 
they too would have felt the goblins’ wrath.
If the PCs have allied themselves with the bugbears 
(Rooms B51-B68), they will have a difficult time con-
cealing their activities from the goblins. The goblins 
are highly suspicious of newcomers and attack any 
on sight. Only a command from their king stays their 
hand. Argliss does not give the PCs free passage if 
he has any reason to believe that the PCs have allied 
themselves with any group other than his fledg-
ling empire.
Bugbears occasionally enter the goblin empire to 
wreak havoc. If the PCs have allied themselves with 
the bugbears and do not assist them here, word gets 
back and any inroads the PCs have with the bugbears 
are shattered.

164
B69 . THE SENTRIES
Most likely, the goblins spot the PCs long before they 
spot the goblins. If for some reason they do not and 
sneak up on the patrol, read the following.
The hallway stretches before you, a group of 
goblins stands guard. They are strangely well 
organized, and well equipped. Each came with a 
short spear and buckler, methodically patrolling the 
hallway moving about 10 feet in each direction.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A patrol has been stationed here to 
prevent bugbears from entering the empire by the 
most obvious route. Due to their darkvision, they 
can see enemies coming and due to the darkness 
of the halls, they are more than likely to see PC 
torches. As a result, the six goblin fighters who 
rotate their patrol with the goblins in Room B70 
prepare to ambush the PCs, sending for reinforce-
ments while they wait inside the various nearby 
hiding places.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Cover
Tactics: As soon as the goblins spot the PCs, they take 
up defensive positions in the nearby halls, while the 
smallest two run to Room B70 for reinforcements. 
Depending on how the PCs approach, they either 
wait for the PCs to pass (coming from the west) or 
head straight there (coming from the south or east). 
Room B70 is approximately 50 ft. away, and it takes 
one turn for them to make it there, and 3d6 seconds 
for the goblins inside to get their gear together.
These goblins have been trained by the hobgob-
lins. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up 
into ranks, four goblins abreast. They advance on 
the PCs stabbing the closest with their spears. The 
goblins hold their bucklers facing forward, offering 
more protection (+1 AC) to the goblin on their left. 
The goblins allow the PCs to rush them, fighting 
better close in.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give the goblins total cover for the first 3 rounds of 
combat. To decrease the challenge, reinforcements 
arrive in double the time.
TACTICS OF THE 
HOLY GOBLIN EMPIRE
Under the guidance of the hobgoblins, 
the goblin forces loyal to Argliss the 
Goblin King are quite formidable. They 
wield short spears & wooden bucklers, 
attacking foes in well-coordinated 
phalanx maneuvers. They advance on 
their enemies with the cold precision 
that has been drilled into them by their 
hobgoblin taskmasters.
The hobgoblins, for their part, have 
formed an effective cavalry unit. 
Mounted on trained worgs, they dart 
in and out of their foes, flanking them 
with rapid attacks. The bugbears and 
rebel goblins have not had success 
against these new tactics. The lightning 
attacks of the hobgoblins, coupled with 
the relentless ones of the foot soldiers 
have proved an effective combination.

165
B70 . FORWARD OUTPOST
If the goblins did not assist the patrol in Room B96, 
read the following.
This long room is an outpost for goblin patrols, 
who are going through the grind of cleaning 
weapons, and so on.
If the goblins did assist the patrol in Room B69, 
read the following.
This long room is an outpost for the goblins. The 
goblin reinforcements spilled out of this room, 
leaving nothing behind. A few hides are laid out 
in precise rows for sleeping. Now empty weapon 
racks rest against the western wall of the room. 
These aren’t typical chaotic goblins. They are 
well-disciplined.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: If the ten elite goblins in this room did 
not assist the goblin patrol in Room B69, they are 
present. They gather their equipment (requiring a 
turn of not moving) and attack the PCs. If the gob-
lins did assist the patrol, then this room is empty.
Encounter Condition: Cover (soft)
Tactics: These goblins have been trained by hobgob-
lins. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form ranks, 
four goblins abreast, two rows deep. The smallest 
two escape through the north door, to get rein-
forcements from Rooms B71, B72, and B73. Alterna-
tively, they throw javelins from the rear ranks.
They advance stabbing the closest PCs with their 
spears. They hold their bucklers facing forward, of-
fering more protection (increasing the AC by +1) to 
the goblin on their left. They allow the PCs to rush 
them, fighting most effectively in close proximity.
This is not an easy encounter and should be an 
indication of this Section’s difficulty. These gob-
lins are not pushovers and challenging them may 
be harder than the PCs thought (which is why the 
bugbears have trouble fighting them).
Treasure: 1d20 javelins and 1d6 spears survive the 
battle. If the PCs did not fight the goblins here, 
double the number of weapons found. There are 
also four suits of leather armor (goblin-sized).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have Haglar Quickwhip (Room B71) arrive 4d6 sec-
onds later (without the goblins retrieving him). To 
decrease the challenge, remove four goblins.
B71 . HAGLAR QUICKWHIP
The door opens slowly. The air reeks of unpleasant 
odors, but the room itself is laid out neatly. A 
simple cot is placed against the southern wall, 
while a desk with various maps and notes sits near 
the western wall.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Haglar Quickwhip is the taskmaster for 
the forward outpost. He also is in charge of the 
small jail in Rooms B72 and B73. He is a formidable 
opponent and a tireless leader. He trains the gob-
lins constantly. He drives the strong to be strong 
and the weak to grow up or move on. He has no 
patience for those who cannot keep up. Even while 
the patrols sleep, Haglar trains, does push-ups, and 
generally stays alert. He’s the quintessential elite 
single-minded warrior.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Concealment, Echoes 
2, Fearless
Tactics: If Haglar hears the PCs coming, he prepares 
for an ambush, attacking from the shadows. Haglar 
stays out of reach of melee combat, deftly using his 
whip to both attack and drive back the PCs. He ma-
neuvers around the room as best as he can, despite 
the limited space. Since he is not above hurting 
those weaker than him, a spellcaster foolish enough 
to expose himself is an easy target.
If forced into melee combat, he disarms the 
nearest PC and uses their weapon or a scimitar 
from his back scabbard (which he wields with two 
hands). Haglar does not call for help until he’s 
reduced to half hit points or less, at which point the 
patrols in Rooms B69 and B70 are allowed Wisdom 
(Perception) checks to see if they hear him. Due to 
the nature of the walls in this room, the goblins 
suffer disadvantage to their checks.
Treasure: On the desk are notes and maps referring 
to various enemy patrols in this Section. The notes 
are written in a scrawling hand, and succeeding a 
DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary 
to make any sense of them.
If deciphered, the notes mention an increase in 
bugbear raids, as well as an ill-fated raid by rebel 
goblins. The last patrol captured a rebel, who is now 
locked in Room B73. The goblin king has ordered 
that the rebel be sacrificed to their god in two days.

166
In addition to his personal possessions, Haglar 
carries a sturdy ring of three keys. One key leads 
to the locked door at Room B72. Another leads to 
Room B73. Finally, the third leads to the worg sta-
bles in Rooms B77 through B82.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the number of goblins affected by Com-
mander of the King’s Horde from 1d3 to 1d6. To 
decrease the challenge, lower it to one.
B72 . THE GOBLIN JAIL
The door to this room is locked. A DC 17 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check picks the door successfully. 
However, there is a 15% chance that the door is also 
barred, requiring a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check 
to break open (DC 22 when locked).
Strong chains and manacles hang from the walls 
and a cell is set in the northern wall. Faint, fearful 
moaning issues forth from the cell.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room serves as the detention area 
for anything captured by the goblin patrols in this 
Section of the dungeon. This jail is overseen by 
Haglar Quickwhip (room B71). If the PCs make too 
much noise in this room, allow Haglar a (DC 18) 
Wisdom (Perception) check to notice, and arrive 4d4 
seconds later.
Encounter Condition: Drafty
Tactics: The jail is empty. The door to the north is 
sturdier than most but has a patchwork lock cut 
into the wood. It looks jury-rigged by crude hands 
as if a saw and hammer were the only avail-
able tools.
The small cell (Room B73) houses a lone goblin 
(G’lp). A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check hears 
his heavy breathing/moaning/weeping.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
B73 . CAPTURED REBEL
The door to this cell is locked, requiring a DC 17 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (or the key from 
Haglar’s belt) to unlock.
Huddled far in the corner is a frightened goblin. 
He is startled by your presence and yelps when he 
notices you.
Initial Attitude: Friendly
Encounter: This wounded goblin, named G’lp, was 
part of a failed raiding party on the part of the rebel 
goblin factions. Once he has been assured that the 
patrols, especially Haglar, have been dealt with, he 
blubbers incoherently, attempting to explain the 
current situation and how the usurper who sits on 
the goblin throne has wronged his people.
If the PCs don’t know what or who Haglar is, he 
assumes the hobgoblin is still alive and cries out for 
help (in goblin), in the hopes of currying favor with 
his jailer. Haglar arrives 1d3 rounds later.
The PCs make out that there is a deep schism 
between the goblins, and the majority of them 
worship a newfound god. The current goblin 
king, who is also the leader of their new religion, 
has formed an alliance with the hobgoblins and 
is training an army to conquer the entire Region 
in the name of his deity. Any goblins that do not 
follow his commands are considered traitors and 
hunted mercilessly. The lucky ones die in combat. 
The unfortunate ones are captured and sacrificed in 
the name of this new god.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: If the PCs release him, G’lp flees the area 
entirely, making his way back to the rebel encamp-
ments on the far side of the Region. If the PCs do 
not release G’lp, he curses the PCs vehemently, 
invoking the names of every stone spirit he can 
muster. If the PCs welcome him into their party, he 
joins, trying to lead the PCs to the rebels. Oth-
erwise, he is glad to be a “part of the team” and 
does his best to carry his weight. Whenever the 
PCs enter a room with G’lp, there is a 35% chance 
that he’s been here before and knows how to “by-
pass” the room.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A

167
B74. ANTECHAMBER OF THE GOBLIN KING
If the PCs killed Hammerfist in Room B85, he is not 
present here.
This large, rectangular room (almost a hallway) is 
polished brightly. Eighteen fierce-looking goblins, 
each wielding a spear, stare at you coldly. Behind 
them, a tall, wide-shouldered hobgoblin carries a 
fist-shaped mallet.
If the goblins heard the PCs coming, read this:
With quick precision, they form a tight phalanx 
and move with deadly intent. The hobgoblin rushes 
madly, swinging his mallet with abandon.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: As the PCs enter the antechamber, they 
are attacked by eighteen goblin warriors and the 
captain of the king’s elite guard, a huge hobgoblin 
named Hammerfist. Because the goblins are train-
ing with Hammerfist, their adrenaline is up and the 
impending fight is just an excuse to cut loose.
After three rounds of combat, Argliss enters 
from Room B75, flanked by two hobgoblin guards. 
If the fight isn’t going too poorly for his men, he or-
ders his guardsmen to stand down and invites the 
PCs into his throne room. The goblin king is articu-
late and polite, unusual for a goblin of any stature.
THE GOBLIN KING
Some time ago the doppelganger Argliss 
entered the Region. He was amused by the 
goblinoids trapped here. Out of boredom, 
he assumed the guise of a goblin and slowly 
worked his way into the good graces of the 
reigning goblin king, Sug’kt. Soon he became a 
chief advisor. He relished the role of bringing a 
culture out of the shadows to suit his whims.
When word of the new “deity” arrived, Argliss 
saw a chance to improve his position amongst 
the goblins. He recently discovered the goblin 
king kept a powerful artifact hidden in his pos-
session. Wanting it for himself, Argliss knew he 
would have to be the goblin king’s confidante. 
Hoping to ingratiate himself with the goblins, 
he urged the king to embrace this new deity. 
The goblin king was incensed. Sug’kt felt he 
alone was ruler of the goblins, as decreed by 
the ancient stone spirits his ancestors wor-
shiped. Popular support was behind the new 
deity, however, and Argliss seized his chance to 
advance his position by staging a coup.
He declared Sug’kt a heretic, sacrificed the 
former king, and claimed the throne in the 
name of the new god of the goblins, Noren-
dithas Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter 
of Foes. Argliss began his quest to not only 
uncover the hidden artifact, but to establish his 
rule over the entire Region.
Unable to locate the artifact, he enlisted the 
help of a halfling who had entered the Section 
(see The Halfling). Argliss believes that Bartleby 
will return the artifact to him, in exchange for 
the goblin’s protection and any trinkets he may 
find. While he awaits Bartleby’s success, he has 
made strides toward ruling the dungeon.
Argliss approached the beleaguered hobgob-
lins, offering them a prime place in his empire. 
Wishing to seek revenge upon the bugbears 
that had tormented them for so long, the hob-
goblins accepted his offer. They now serve as 
elite guards and trainers of the goblin army.
Upon encountering the PCs, Argliss tries to 
ally with them. He feels their power and knows 
they could be very disruptive to his efforts. He 
is willing to assist the PCs in their mission, as 
long as they return the favor and help him wipe 
out the bugbears and rebel faction of goblins.
If the PCs do not accept his offer, all goblins 
loyal to him attack the PCs on sight.
TACTICS
Argliss is not a fighter. In the event of conflict, 
he orders his guards to attack while he runs off. 
Once the battle is engaged he changes shape 
to something inconspicuous and flees the area, 
returning to his throne room.
If Argliss is cornered and cannot escape, he 
uses the rod of wonder and necklace of fireballs 
liberally until he causes enough of a distraction 
that he can flee.

168
If more than five goblins have been slain, how-
ever, he directs the hobgoblins to join him as he 
bars the door and prepares for the PCs. In this case, 
the PCs are in for a tough fight. Additionally, if 
the PCs do not wish to speak with the goblin king, 
the battle continues until either the guards or the 
PCs are dead.
Encounter Condition: Fearless (save for the 
goblin king).
Tactics: These elite goblins are just now starting their 
training with Hammerfist. The others are either 
on patrol or standing guard in another area of 
the dungeon.
In combat, instead of swarming the PCs, they 
form up into ranks, six goblins abreast, three rows 
deep. They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest 
PCs with their spears. They hold their bucklers fac-
ing forward, offering more protection (+1 bonus to 
AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the 
PCs to rush them, gaining attacks of opportunity as 
the PCs move into their threat range.
Hammerfist on the other hand, hunts the PCs. 
He does not draw attacks of opportunity if he can 
help it, but he does try to push past anyone who 
leaves an opening. Hammerfist, hates clerics and 
targets those openly displaying holy symbols. He is 
also fond of crippling attacks and targets PCs with 
little to no armor when he can.
Treasure: The weapon racks are filled with spears. All 
the spears are small, however, designed for goblins. 
Their size means for creatures larger than small size 
they lose reach and gain thrown (40/80).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase each goblin’s hit points by +5. To reduce 
the challenge of this encounter remove six goblins.
B75. THRONE ROOM OF THE GOBLIN KING
If the PCs accepted the goblin king’s offer to negoti-
ate, read the following.
This room is large and opulently decorated. Hides 
from various animals are layered on the floor, while 
others hang as trophies or tapestries from the walls. 
Two large braziers cast a sinister, yet regal glow on 
a throne of bone and stone standing prominently in 
the room, and it is where the goblin king sits.
He wears a bright leather vest and pants. A velvet 
cloak hangs from his shoulders. On his head 
rests a light, silver crown, and he wields a multi-
hued scepter in his left hand. “Welcome friends, 
I am Argliss, King of the Goblins and Voice of 
Norendithas Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter 
of Foes. The Stoneshaper has brought us together 
for great things I’m sure. Please, hear what I have to 
say,” the goblin king intones as you approach him.
If the PCs declined the goblin king’s offer to parlay, 
or have snuck in, read the following.
The room is large, and well-appointed for goblins 
but without the pomp and circumstance of the 
goblin king, his court, and his guards, it looks like 
any room that’s been covered in hides. A pair of large 
braziers cast a ruddy glow about the room, playing 
off the brightly polished walls. In the center is a 
throne of rubble and bones, a scepter resting upon it.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: If the PCs choose to continue the bat-
tle in Room B74, this encounter does not happen 
and they are free to explore the room as long as 
they wish.
The goblin king, Argliss, who is interested in the 
PCs’ services, informs them of the new destiny of 
the goblins. Their god, Norendithas Stoneshaper 
the Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes, has finally ar-
rived and promises to lead them to power and glory.
“Any who serve the will of the Stoneshaper shall be 
greatly rewarded, in this life and the next!” the goblin 
king proclaims.
The goblin king only wishes for more patsies 
to serve his whims. Argliss is very good at hiding 
this truth though; only a successful DC 24 Wisdom 
(Insight) check lets the PCs know the goblin king is 
being less than truthful.
If the PCs agree to assist the goblin king, he 
tasks them with killing the rebel chieftain Guk 
(Room B95). They must return with proof of his 
death. If they do so, the goblin king welcomes 
them as members of the glorious empire of the 
Stoneshaper.
Once the PCs agree to ally with the goblin king, 
the elite hobgoblin guard files out of the room and 
returns to their barracks (Room B84). Hammerfist 
snarls at the PCs one last time before he too leaves 
and returns to his quarters (Room B85).

169
If the PCs refuse the goblin king’s offer, he be-
comes enraged. “None defy the will of the Stone-
shaper!” he shouts. Hammerfist lets loose with a 
bellowing war cry and is ready to charge the PCs. 
The goblin king halts his advance however and of-
fers the PCs one last chance to see the error of their 
ways and join him.
A second refusal is all it takes. “May the Stone-
shaper have mercy on your wretched souls,” the 
goblin king says as Hammerfist and the elite guard 
attack the PCs.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The goblin warriors move on Hammerfist’s 
command. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form 
up into ranks, six goblins abreast, three rows deep. 
They advance on the PCs, stabbing the closest to 
them with their spears. They hold their bucklers fac-
ing forward, offering more protection (+1 bonus to 
AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the 
PCs to rush them, gaining attacks of opportunity as 
the PCs move into their threat range.
Hammerfist goes after the weakest PC first, 
targeting spellcasters first. He also has a fond 
hatred for clerics and abuses them at every turn. 
He fights as intelligently as possible, stepping back 
when overwhelmed and taking full advantage of 
prone PCs.
If the goblin king is in danger, he flees to Room 
B74, and from there heads to Room B77. In the 
meantime, he uses his rod of wonder on whatever 
PC presents the biggest threat and his necklace of 
fireballs if too many goblins fall.
Treasure: If the PCs choose not to listen to the goblin 
king, and he is forced to flee, he leaves behind his 
royal scepter (laying on his throne) on a failed DC 16 
Intelligence save. The scepter is a rod of wonder.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add three fighter levels to Hammerfist. To reduce 
the challenge of this encounter, remove one fighter 
level from Hammerfist.
B76. PRIVATE ROOM OF THE GOBLIN KING
The door leading to Region A is locked and barred, 
requiring a DC 30 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, 
followed by a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check to 
open. A small chest rests against the door as well, 
making it difficult to open the door all the way.
The doors from Room B75 are also locked and 
require a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to 
open. In both cases, the goblin king carries keys to 
these doors.
After you dispatch the last of the goblins, you 
enter this room, the private quarters of the goblin 
king, Argliss. The room is very befitting of a king. 
Exquisite hides are piled as a comfortable bed, 
while others adorn the walls as tapestries. A good-
sized strongbox is tucked into the northeastern 
corner of the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: If the PCs made an alliance with the gob-
lin king and attempt to enter this room, they are 
warned that it is off-limits. If they persist the goblin 
king calls off the alliance and orders his guards to 
attack the PCs. The goblin king flees before the PCs 
can capture or kill him, returning in 2d6 minutes 
with reinforcements to drive the PCs out.
This room is luxuriously furnished with a thick 
layer of hides forming a comfortable sleeping area 
in the northwestern corner. The walls are decorated 
with tapestries made of similar hides. They depict 
the conquests and glories of the new goblin king 
and his god.
A small chest is situated against the northeast-
ern wall. A DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check 
is required to unlock it. It contains the room’s trea-
sure (see below).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: +1 shortsword, +1 leather armor (made for a 
goblin), +1 buckler. It is possible the PCs may wish 
to take the hides as well for their own personal use, 
or for future sales. They are large, made of worg 
hide, and carrying more than one proves to be 
cumbersome.
Scaling: N/A

170
B77. ENTRANCE TO THE WORG STABLES
The door to this room (leading from the eastern hall) 
is locked, requiring a successful DC 19 Dexterrity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. The door leading 
from Region A is also locked, requiring a DC 22 Dex-
terity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.
Pungent smells and keening wails saturate the air. 
The floor is covered, stained, and scratched. Even 
the walls are not devoid of claw marks. Along the 
southern wall are a series of iron doors, much like 
cell doors. The room quiets for a brief moment, 
then it erupts into loud howls and barks. Whatever 
is in these cells, knows you’re here.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These cells are the goblins’ worg sta-
bles, the home of their vicious worg mounts. This 
hallway leads to the “cells’’ where the elite worg 
mounts are kept. The stables themselves are large. 
Most are noisy, except the one at the west end, 
which is deathly quiet. Due to their Scent ability, 
it is nearly impossible for the PCs to surprise the 
worgs in these cells.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Echoes 2, 
Unhallowed
Tactics: This series of cell doors are sturdy and are all 
locked. The keys to these doors are kept by Haglar 
(B71), the Goblin King’s (B75) bodyguards, and a 
handful of elite goblins.
The “cells” were used (long ago) to house 
demons, an effect that has caused the worgs to 
become even more bestial than they already were.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
B78 . WORG STABLE
Four large wolves sleep comfortably in this cell. 
Despite the barking and howling coming from 
other cells, these animals are not as crazed. One 
of the wolves looks up as you enter the room but 
quickly lies back down again.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: These four worgs have just returned from 
a successful patrol and are tired. Although the PCs 
represent a threat, they are satiated from hunting 
and want to rest. The worgs have enough energy to 
defend themselves if the PCs attack them but suffer 
from a level of exhaustion.
Encounter Condition: Fearless, Unhallowed
Tactics: These worgs fight like a typical pack, tripping 
and grounding the weakest PC and then mauling 
them while prone. If a single PC gets separated 
from the party, or the PC attacks too quickly, the 
worgs surround and flank them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this en-
counter, change the worgs’ initiative roll to 
exactly 1 lower than the highest PC, allowing 
them to ambush the “impulsive PC.” Alternately, 
add two worgs. To decrease the challenge, re-
move one worg.

171
B79 . THE BLACK WORG
The barks issuing from this cell are louder than 
from any other cell. With a successful DC 17 Wisdom 
(Perception) check, the PCs can discern a single loud 
bark, deeper and more aggressive than any of the 
other cells.
From the darkness, a large black wolf stands at 
least five feet at the shoulder. Its powerful muscles 
ripple under its sleek, black coat. At first, it doesn’t 
notice you. Suddenly its hackles raise, and it turns, 
snarling. With a mighty howl, it bursts free of its 
meager enclosure and leaps at you.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A black worg (worg alpha) is stabled here. 
It is twice as large as any other worg in the gob-
lin’s possession. It is also twice as feral. Worgs may 
have some measure of intelligence, but this one is 
bestial. When the PCs enter the room it breaks free 
of its inadequate holding pen and lunges at the 
nearest one. The PCs have no choice but to defend 
themselves.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Distracting Noises, 
Echoes 2, Fearless, Unhallowed
Tactics: The black worg attacks like an animal, vicious 
and unrelenting. It uses its trip attack every round, 
taking advantage of weak PCs. It knows no fear and 
does not respond to pain.
Killing the black worg earns the ire of Hammer-
fist (Room B85) should he find out; he was break-
ing in the worg to be his personal mount. There 
is little choice for the PCs in this matter, however, 
and they must deal with Hammerfist’s wrath. Any 
explanation the PCs offer is not good enough for 
the hobgoblin.
Treasure: The black worg wears a heavy leather collar, 
set with three discolored gems, none of which 
match. The collar is worth 25 gp to a jeweler who 
can salvage the stones.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two Hit Dice to the black worg. To reduce the 
challenge of this encounter, replace the black worg’s 
stats with that of a worg.
B80 . FILTHY STABLE
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.
A pack of four, miserable-looking wolves, larger 
than normal, are penned up in this stable. Whether 
they are being punished or neglected is difficult to 
say. They growl and snap at you, but otherwise 
remain behind their enclosure.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Four worgs are being punished for dis-
obeying their riders’ instructions during a recent 
patrol. They do not attack the PCs first but defend 
themselves if provoked. While not chained, they 
lack the ability to open the locked door.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If a fight ensues, the worgs gang up on 
the weakest PC first followed by other opponents 
without visible metal armor. They concentrate all 
their attacks until the victim is down. Like all pack 
animals, the alpha male delivers the coup de grace 
before the pack moves on to the next PC. If the 
victim fails a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw their 
attacks knock creatures they damage prone.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add one worg. To 
decrease the challenge, remove one worg.
B81 . EMPTY STABLE
No noise comes from this cell.
Like the other holding pens, this stable is shoddily 
constructed. This stable is empty, save for some 
discarded refuse on the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This stable is currently empty; the worgs 
normally housed in it are out on patrol with their 
hobgoblin masters. There is nothing of interest.
Encounter Condition: Fear 15, Unhallowed
Tactics: The goblins rely heavily on the training and 
cooperation of their worg mounts. It is quite obvi-
ous that the worgs stay here because they wish to, 
not because they are forced to.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A

172
B82. THE GOBLIN KING'S MOUNT, THE YETH HOUND
A sleek hound with a dull, black coat and glowing 
cherry-red eyes pads around in the most luxurious 
pen in the stables. This is the mount of the goblin 
king, and the king takes very good care of it. With 
a lazy turn of its head, the yeth hound takes you 
in—and promptly dismisses you.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: The yeth hound is the pride of the goblin 
king. Serving as his personal mount, it is not only 
effective in combat, but the goblin king considers 
the hound a symbol of his power and divine rule. 
For its part, the yeth hound could care less about 
the PCs. It is confident in its combat abilities and 
knows its master’s loyal servants are nearby.
The yeth hound only attacks if provoked.
Encounter Condition: Fear 14, Fearless, Unhallowed
Tactics: If the PCs attack the yeth hound, it flees and 
seeks out the goblin king (Room B75), unleashing 
a series of Bay attacks if cornered. If the PCs are 
stunned, the yeth hound slips by, continuing to Bay 
until it has escaped or is killed by the PCs.
Regardless of the outcome, the goblin king 
undoubtedly surmises the PCs killed his mount 
(unless he has yet to meet them, in which case he 
assumes it was bugbear raiders). Any alliance they 
forged is now broken. From this point on, all initial 
attitudes in encounters with the goblin king’s sol-
diers are considered Hostile.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have eight goblins arrive after 6d3 seconds to assist 
the yeth hound. To decrease the challenge, reduce 
the yeth hound’s hit points by -20.
B83. SOUTHWESTERN OUTPOST
If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in Room 
B75, read the following.
This squat, spartan room serves as the 
southwestern most outpost of the goblin empire. 
The dozen goblins in this room stare blankly at you 
as you enter. The goblin king has ordered his army 
to treat you with respect, but these goblins seem 
to be waiting for you to make a misstep; it is quite 
obvious they do not want you here.
If the PCs have not allied with the goblin king in 
Room B75, read the following.
This squat room is an outpost, guarding against 
incursions. Nearly a dozen goblins are messing 
about and get into formation as you enter.
If the goblins are not surprised, read the following.
They await you with their sharp spears pointing 
menacingly in your direction. They form a perfect 
phalanx and advance upon you.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly or Hostile
Encounter: There are twelve goblin warriors stand-
ing guard here in various stages of readiness. If 
surprised, they take a round to form up into ranks. 
If they heard the PCs coming, they are already in 
formation when the door opens, whether the PCs 
are allies or not.
If the PCs formed an alliance with the goblin 
king, the initial attitude of the goblins is Unfriendly. 
They allow the PCs to wander through the barracks 
as long as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs 
take any actions the goblins perceive as a threat, 
their attitude becomes Hostile and they attack.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: In combat, instead of swarming the PCs, they 
form up into ranks, four goblins abreast, three rows 
deep. They advance on the PCS stabbing the closest 
PCs with their spears. They hold their bucklers 
facing forward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to 
the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to 
rush them.
Two of the goblins are not Fearless and bail at 
the first sign of trouble (e.g., three goblins fall, they 
suffer at least 1 point of damage, overtly powerful 
magic is displayed, etc.). They head for Room B84 
to retrieve reinforcements, taking 4d6 seconds to 
get there and 4d6 seconds to return.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add six goblins. To reduce the challenge of this 
encounter, remove six.

173
B84. KING'S ELITE GUARD BARRACKS
If the PCs have formed an alliance with the goblin 
king in Room B75, read the following.
These barracks are simple and minimalist. These 
goblins have no requirement for comfort; they are 
hardened soldiers ready to die for their king and 
their god. They stare at you but do not make any 
aggressive moves. The king has granted you his 
protection, and they will not violate his orders.
If the PCs have not formed an alliance with the 
goblin king in Room B75, read the following.
These barracks are simple and minimalist.
If the goblins are not surprised, read the following.
You are confronted by twelve zealous and well-
trained goblins. They form one cohesive unit 
and raise their spears above their heads with a 
massive war cry.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent or Hostile
Encounter: There are twelve elite goblins standing 
guard here in various stages of readiness. If sur-
prised, they take a round to form up into ranks. If 
they heard the PCs coming, they are already in for-
mation when the door opens, whether the PCs are 
allies or not. They gain a +2 to their initiative rolls if 
the PCs make noise before entering.
If the PCs formed an alliance with the goblin 
king, the initial attitude of the goblins is Indifferent. 
They allow the PCs to wander through the barracks 
as long as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs 
take any actions the goblins perceive as a threat, 
their attitude becomes Hostile and they attack.
The room itself is a spartan affair with a weap-
on rack along the western wall and a precise layer 
of sleeping hides on the floor. If the PCs defeated 
the elite guard in Room B74, this room does not 
contain any goblins.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: As soon as the goblins spot the PCs, they take 
up defensive positions in the nearby halls, while the 
smallest two run to Room B86 for reinforcements.
These goblins have been trained by the hobgob-
lins. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up 
into three ranks, four goblins abreast. They advance 
on the PCs stabbing the closest with their spears. 
The goblins hold their bucklers facing forward, 
offering more protection (+1 to AC) to the goblin on 
their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them, 
as they fight more efficiently at close range.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each goblin +5 hp. To reduce the challenge, 
remove four goblins.
B85. HAMMERFIST, CAPTAIN OF THE KING'S GUARD
If the PCs have formed an alliance with the goblin 
king in Room B75, read the following.
The large hobgoblin from the king’s antechamber 
angrily paces back and forth in this room. He 
wields the same fist-shaped club, swinging wildly 
at the room’s walls. As he notices you, he violently 
spits at the ground. “Come to try and finish what I 
started, have you?” he taunts.
If the PCs have not formed an alliance with the 
goblin king in Room B75, read the following.
A large hobgoblin angrily paces back and forth in 
this room, he wields a fist-shaped club, swinging 
wildly at the room’s walls  A feral grin sprouts 
across his scarred face and he turns to face you 
“Finally!” he shouts.
After the PCs have cleared the room of any hostile 
creatures, or if they defeated Hammerfist in Room 
B74, read the following.
Hammerfist’s room is very spartan. A simple 
sleeping hide lies in a corner of the room. A map 
of the goblin empire is nailed to the southern 
wall. The western wall features a small collection 
of skulls, obviously war trophies the hobgoblin 
claimed from his foes.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Regardless of the PCs and their relation-
ship with the goblin king, Hammerfist’s attitude 
towards them is never better than Unfriendly. If 
the PCs killed the black worg in Room B79 (and he 
knows about it), Hammerfist becomes Hostile and 
attacks them, screaming about revenge.

174
As long as Hammerfist is merely Unfriendly 
towards the PCs, he doesn’t initiate combat against 
them. He does, however, taunt, threaten, and other-
wise provoke them into attacking him. Hammerfist 
does not like the PCs and wishes to see them dead.
Encounter Condition: Fearless, Negative Energy, 
Unhallowed
Tactics: Hammerfist thinks no one is stronger than 
he is. To prove it, he calls the strongest PC out to 
fight one-on-one. He goes toe to toe, never giving 
an inch. Because of his ego, he fights to the death.
If the PCs do not fight fair, neither does he. He 
finishes off unconscious PCs and helpless PCs have 
their fingers and hands broken under his boot or 
with his war club.
While fighting, he shouts obscenities and 
other unsavory things at the PCs but does not 
call for reinforcements. His aggressive and bois-
terous mannerism is sure to unnerve even the 
strongest PCs.
If reinforcements do arrive, it is of their own 
initiative. Hammerfist is immune to the Negative 
Energy in this room.
Treasure: Hammerfist keeps a strongbox. It is un-
locked as no one is foolish enough to tamper with 
his belongings. Inside the box is a sling, a handaxe, 
450 gp, 51 pp, a silver and gold ring with detailed 
filigree, an inlaid design of an owl (600 gp), six 
arrows, four bolts, and two healing potions.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the elite goblins in Room B84 arrive 3d6 
seconds later. To decrease the challenge, increase 
Haymaker’s movement penalty to -30 ft., and 
remove the hit die based damage from Maim.
B86. DRILL ROOM
If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in Room 
B75, read the following.
A huge hobgoblin barks commands and mercilessly 
drills a group of goblins. He glances over at you 
but says nothing. You get the distinct impression 
that treaty or no, this hobgoblin is looking for any 
excuse to test his men against your mettle.
If the PCs have not allied with the goblin king in 
Room B75, read the following.
A mighty bellow erupts as you enter this room. ‘At 
last! Fresh meat!” roars a huge hobgoblin wielding 
a wicked great axe. Upon his command, the goblins 
in the room form up and advance on you with 
calculating precision. The hobgoblin, however, 
charges at you with wild abandon.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: There are twelve goblin warriors in various 
stages of training in this room. If surprised, they 
take a round to form into ranks. If they heard the 
PCs coming, they are already in formation when the 
door opens, whether the PCs are allies or not.
If the PCs formed an alliance with the goblin 
king, the initial attitude of the goblins is Indifferent. 
They allow them to wander through the barracks 
as long as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs 
take any actions the goblins perceive as a threat, 
their attitude becomes Hostile and they attack.
Their leader, Goblinbane, is a wicked taskmas-
ter and the chief trainer under the goblin king. 
He earned his name for his brutal methods and 
callous disregard for whoever could not withstand 
the training. As long as the PCs do not disrupt his 
training, he is content to let them watch and learn 
how a true master creates an army.
Of course, if the PCs have not allied with the 
goblin king, Goblinbane and his goblin trainees at-
tack the PCs as soon as they step foot in the room.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: These goblins have been trained by Goblin-
bane. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up 
into ranks, four goblins abreast, three rows deep. 
They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest with 
their spears. They hold their bucklers facing for-
ward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to the goblin 
on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them 
forming a defensive line of spears.
Goblinbane seeks out the most prominent PC 
and engages them in close combat, swinging his 
powerful greataxe mercilessly. Occasionally Gob-
linbane barks commands to the goblins, adjusting 
their tactics to keep up with the PCs’ movements.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase challenge, goblin warriors from 
Room B83 arrive in 6d6 seconds. To lessen it, re-
move Goblinbane’s Martial Advantage and lower the 
number affected by the Commander of the King’s 
Horde to one.

175
B87 . PATROL BARRACKS
If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in Room 
B75, read the following.
This barracks is a long room with simple weapon 
racks and hides on the floor. You are met with some 
cold stares and toothy grimaces but are otherwise 
left alone by the goblins.
If the PCs have not formed an alliance with the 
goblin king in Room B75, read the following.
A patrol, recently returned, stops in their tracks as 
you enter the room. With uncanny precision, they 
return to formation and set their sights on you.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room is a holding area. Returning 
patrols rest here before going back out. There is a 
staging area towards the east where the patrols de-
part from. There are twelve goblin warriors stowing 
gear and relaxing. If surprised, they take a round to 
form up into ranks. If they heard the PCs coming, 
they are already in formation when the door opens, 
whether the PCs are allies or not.
If the PCs are allies of the goblin king, the initial 
attitude of the goblins is Indifferent. They allow the 
PCs to wander through the barracks as long as they 
do not disturb anything. If the PCs take any actions 
the goblins perceive as a threat, their attitude be-
comes Hostile and they attack the PCs.
The barracks itself resembles others in the gob-
lin empire. The weapons racks and sleeping hides 
are precisely arranged and the crude map in the 
middle of the room accurately details the goblin 
patrols in this area of the dungeon.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: If the PCs engage the goblins they have to 
deal with reinforcements. After 6d6 seconds, an-
other phalanx of twelve goblin warriors arrive from 
Room B88. Their tactics are identical to the goblins 
already engaged with the PCs, but they attempt to 
flank the PCs currently engaged.
These goblins have been trained by Goblinbane 
(Room B86). Instead of swarming the PCs, they 
form up into three ranks, four goblins abreast. 
They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest with 
their spears. The goblins hold their bucklers facing 
forward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to the 
goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to 
rush them, fighting better close in.
Treasure: The footlockers are filled with personal 
(worthless) trinkets, only valuable to the goblins.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the goblin warriors from Room B88 join the 
battle one turn after rolling initiative. To decrease 
the challenge, the goblins from Room B88 arrive 
after 36 seconds.
B88 . SOUTHEASTERN OUTPOST
If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in room 
B75, read the following.
This outpost serves as a forward observation 
point and command center in the goblin king’s 
war against the rebel splinter faction. A dozen 
goblins prepare themselves for their next patrol as 
you enter. Your presence is ignored, as the goblins 
have more pressing concerns. Reports of a large 
upcoming raid are circulating amongst the troops, 
and each wants to be a member of the patrol that 
crushes the rebel scum.
If the PCs have not allied with the goblin king in 
Room B75, read the following.
As you enter this outpost, a dozen bloodthirsty 
goblins turn and face you. They quickly grab their 
weapons and form an impressive phalanx. Their 
spear points drop and they attack.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room is a transitional chamber. 
Returning patrols rest here before going back out. 
There is a staging area towards the east where the 
patrols depart from. There are twelve goblin war-
riors stowing gear and relaxing. If surprised, they 
take a round to form up into ranks. If they heard 
the PCs coming, they are already in formation when 
the door opens, whether the PCs are allies or not.
If the PCs have allied with the goblin king, the 
initial attitude of the goblins is Indifferent. They al-
low the PCs to wander through the barracks as long 
as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs take any 
actions the goblins perceive as a threat, their atti-
tude becomes Hostile and they attack the PCs.
The barracks itself is much like the others con-
tained in the goblin empire. The weapons racks and 

176
sleeping hides are arranged precisely and the crude 
map in the middle of the room accurately details 
the goblin patrols in this area of the dungeon.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: If the PCs engage the goblins they have to 
deal with reinforcements. After 6d6 seconds of 
combat, another phalanx of twelve goblin warriors 
arrive from Room B87. Their tactics are identical to 
the goblins already engaged with the PCs, but they 
attempt to flank the PCs currently engaged.
These goblins have been trained by Goblinbane 
(Room B86). Instead of swarming the PCs, they 
form up into three ranks, four goblins abreast. 
They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest with 
their spears. The goblins hold their bucklers facing 
forward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to the 
goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to 
rush them, fighting better close in.
Treasure: The footlockers are filled with personal 
(worthless) trinkets, only valuable to the goblins.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, have 
the goblins from Room B87 join the battle after 
36 seconds.
B89 . HAUNTED TOMBS
The hallways intersect, again and again. It would 
seem as though a door could appear somewhere. 
But there is none. Just the same clean corridor over 
and over again. And then the realization that the 
silence is heavy hits you. Something is amiss.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A sense of dread should overcome the 
PCs at this point. Feel free to spook them at ev-
ery turn with shadows and intermittent sounds of 
chains rattling. Have the command, suggestion, and 
cause fear spells be cast on them randomly. Lastly, a 
deep, allip-like moan is sure to scare them straight.
In addition to any other effects going on, there 
is a blanket of silence that pervades the tomb and 
affects the PCs 50% of the time, severely hamper-
ing their ability to communicate and cast spells. 
While there is no noise, treat this as Distracting 
Noises for the purposes of spellcasting.
hAUnTED ToMb ConTEnTs
For every tomb the PCs open, roll on this table:
D20encounter
1A hot wind escapes from the tomb. Drafty.
2
A swarm of rats run past the PCs and out the door. While they are no threat and deal no damage, if 
they run west or south they are sure to find the goblins who send scouts to investigate.
3A small earthquake rumbles through the section. Tremors 15.
4-12Nothing.
13
The tomb is worn by time and falling apart. If the PCs decide to enter despite this it begins to crumble 
and fall inward on them. Any PCs who fail a Dexterity (DC 15) saving throw receive 6d4 bludgeoning 
damage as the stone collapses onto them.
14A fire trap (Room B18) has been cast on the threshold to keep grave robbers at bay.
15
The door unseals and a deluge of water pours forth. PCs within 10 ft. have their torches doused and 
are soaked.
16
When the threshold is crossed, a spray of darts fly out of the tomb. Any creature not completely 
obscured by another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage 
and be poisoned until their next long rest. The trapped tiles can be found with a DC 16 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check, and disabled with a further DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand).
17
When the seal on the tomb breaks, centuries of death fumes (a 5th-level cloudkill, spell save DC 14) roll 
forth from the tomb.
18The PCs are attacked by 1d3+1 wights.
19The PCs are attacked by 1d4+1 vargouilles. Ambush.
20The PCs are attacked by 1d6+1 ghouls.

177
While the map does not show secret doors, 
there is a way to enter each tomb. The mecha-
nism is complicated and to date, the goblins have 
not found it.
Located at the two-foot-high mark on the north 
wall of each tomb is a small unholy sigil. While each 
is designed differently, the key to opening the tomb 
is through this sigil. There are three different ways 
to open the tomb. One is for a lawful good PC (or 
one you determine sufficiently demonstrates those 
values) to completely trace the entire surface of the 
sigil. Another is to cast knock directly onto the sigil. 
Finally, the PCs can smear the blood of an angel 
into the sigil, covering the surface.
If any of these actions are taken, a 5-ft-by-5-ft 
section of wall slides open and up into the ceiling. 
If the PCs open a tomb, roll on the table in the pre-
vious page to see if they encounter anything:
Encounter Condition: [Ambush], Cursed 3, [Distract-
ing Noises], Drafty, Fear 16, Haunted, Negative 
Energy, [Spell Resistance], Unhallowed
Tactics: Once the tomb is open, the creatures (if 
present) lunge at the PCs. These beasts have been 
entombed for centuries and are eager to escape, 
most likely fighting in a crazed and wild manner. 
The actual details are left up to the GM, but these 
creatures are interested in feeding on the flesh of 
one PC and escaping soon after. Killing them all is 
not possible.
The ghouls attack the lead PCs, the vargouilles 
use their Kiss attack, and the wights swipe at the 
PC with the least armor on. They do not put them-
selves in harm’s way to get to the PCs but do not let 
the PCs box them in either.
Treasure: None of these creatures were buried with 
treasure, but the GM is welcome to drop a trin-
ket here and there, so the PCs don’t feel cheated. 
The largest treasure should be no bigger than 
a +1 dagger or a healing potion.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
roll twice per tomb. To decrease the challenge, roll 
once for every 2 tombs opened.
B90 . ABANDONED BARRACKS
The hallway leading to this room is trapped. Allow 
the PCs Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice, but 
since there are four traps in various locations, the GM 
should feel free to use them as they see fit.
 '
Portcullis Trap. When 15 lbs. of weight are applied to 
the pressure plate on either side of the arch a port-
cullis slams down. Creatures underneath are skew-
ered and crushed and must succeed a Dexterity 
saving throw (DC 13) or take 2d8 piercing and 2d8 
bludgeoning damage. Additionally, creatures that 
fail to save are pinned underneath, preventing 
movement until freed. Any creature that can lift 
200 lbs. of weight can reliably lift the gate 1 ft. off 
the ground, with the weight requirement doubling 
for each additional foot of distance desired.
While not subtle, the trap still requires active at-
tention to notice. Once found the plate can simply 
be stepped over, or disabled by wedging it.
 '
Spring-loaded Darts. When the tripwire is pulled a 
spray of darts snap across the hall. Starting from 
the east wall any creature not completely obscured 
by another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving 
throw or take 2d8 piercing damage and be poisoned 
until their next long rest.
The trap holes and tripwire can be found with 
a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and 
disabled with a further DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight 
of Hand). Undoing this mechanism leaves the 
darts open for the taking. The first time a dart 
deals damage it loses its poison and poisons the 
damaged creature if they fail a DC 14 Constitution 
saving throw.
 '
Crude Spear Trap. Any PC rolling higher than 12 on 
a Wisdom (Perception) check in the hall easily spots 
the spears. These spears spring forward if the trig-
ger (a weave of wooden poles hidden under a hide 
on the floor, spanning the hall) is activated. Dis-
arming it is as simple as knocking each of the two 
spears over, where their springs engage and disarm 
themselves.
PCs that fail to notice the spears or charge in 
heedlessly and trigger the trap, must succeed a Dex-
terity save (DC 15) or receive 1d8 piercing damage.
 '
Tripping Chain. Strung across the path is a thin 
chain. Robust enough to be a tripping hazard, and 
acting as a setup for a much nastier chain. Both 
are simple and crudely concealed (DC 11 Wisdom 
(Perception) required to spot). Stepping on the first 
chain will knock the victim prone unless they pass a 
Dexterity or Strength saving throw (DC 12), wherein 
they must succeed a second Dexterity saving throw 
(DC 14) to take half damage from falling onto the 
spiked chain.

178
Creatures that step onto the spiked chain receive 
2d8 piercing damage as the wicked hooks and 
barbs rend at them. They may also trip from this, 
requiring the same saves as above but done with 
advantage this time. Reduce this damage by 1 for 
every point of AC the creature possesses over 12. 
Creatures that fall onto the chain receive an addi-
tional 1d8 damage for each size category they are 
above small (medium +1d8, large +2d8, huge +3d8).
Outside of adverse circumstances, small and tiny 
creatures are not tall enough to fall onto the spiked 
chain and simply faceplant into the floor.
Disarming the chains requires pulling the inter-
locking pins that keep them taut and tossing them 
aside. No check is needed once spotted. However, 
the mechanism isn’t completely intuitive. Less 
mechanically inclined PCs might require a suc-
cessful Intelligence (Investigation) (DC 10) check to 
understand.
A long wide room stretches before you. Abandoned, 
disheveled, and broken bunks and cots line the 
walls and floor. Someone or something has 
ransacked these chambers. The thick layer of dust 
suggests it was not recently cleaned.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Long ago, the goblins controlled most of 
the Region. Now, with the bugbear raiding parties 
and goblin rebels, it is difficult to control the outly-
ing sections. The hobgoblins convinced the goblin 
king it would be easier to defend a smaller area, and 
pulled back to Room B69 through B88 (hence the 
concentration of manpower in such a small area).
As a result, they often send patrols up here to 
“check things out,” but the recent “tossing” of the 
room has caused them to rethink their strategy. If 
a goblin Random Encounter is rolled in the vicinity 
of Rooms B90 and B91, there is a 50% chance the 
Encounter is “Nothing.”
Encounter Condition: Fearless, Hazardous Footing 14
Tactics: There is nothing here now, but if the PCs 
insist on rummaging through the debris, feel free 
to have a bugbear patrol happen upon them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a pit trap (Room B40). To reduce the challenge, 
remove the portcullis trap.
B91 . NORTHEASTERN OUTPOST
This box-like room smells of charcoal and smoke. 
The blackened walls and burned furniture indicate 
only one culprit—fire. Along the back wall, resting 
on a small ledge, is a red and black urn, apparently 
unscarred by all the chaos.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Another abandoned outpost, this room 
has been set ablaze and sacked several times, leav-
ing the goblins wondering what the bugbears’ true 
tactics are. On the far wall is a small ledge with a red 
and black urn. On its face is written “The Unnamed 
Law” in Goblinoid. The bugbears hope that the 
goblins will inspect it or at least assume an import-
ant bugbear was killed. So far no one has fallen for 
it, but should anyone touch the urn, a trap triggers 
and darts fly from the north and south walls.
 '
Spring-loaded darts. When the urn is touched darts 
spray across the room. Starting from the traps’ re-
spective walls any creature not completely obscured 
by another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving 
throw or take 2d8 piercing damage and be poisoned 
until their next long rest. This occurs twice, once for 
the north and once for the south.
The trap-holes and hair trigger beneath the urn 
can be found with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check, or a Wisdom (Perception) roll over 18 
in the room, and disabled with a DC 16 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand). Undoing this mechanism leaves 
the darts open for the taking. When used as weap-
ons, the first time a dart deals damage it loses its 
poison and poisons the target if they fail a DC 14 
Constitution saving throw.
Encounter Condition: Ambush
Tactics: This room is patrolled by the bugbears often. 
They hope the goblins will believe the room was an 
important outpost and its loss drove them deeper 
into the dungeon, or that an important bugbear 
was killed here. Either way, its presence baffles the 
goblins and sooner or later a patrol will get antsy 
and grab the urn. To add insult to injury, if the trap 
goes off, there is a 25% chance that bugbears from 
Room B66 arrive to investigate in 3d6 rounds.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add a loud 
alarm to the trap that guarantees bugbears from 
room B66 investigate. To reduce the challenge, 
lower the Wisdom (Perception) check to 14.

D20encounter
1
The path is trapped with spring-loaded Darts. When the tripwire is pulled a spray of darts snap across 
the hall. Pick d3 PCs, they must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage 
and be poisoned until their next long rest. The trap holes and tripwire can be found with a DC 16 
Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled with a further DC 16 Sleight of Hand. Undoing this 
mechanism leaves the darts open for the taking. The first time a dart deals damage it loses its poison 
and poisons the damaged creature if they fail a Constitution (DC 14) save.
2
A whittled wooden duckling lies off the path. Touching the duckling soaks the PC and casts lightning 
bolt (spell save DC 13) at 3rd level towards them. This happens only once, and dispel magic will remove 
the hostile enchantment without harming the item. Any creature who holds the duckling is rapidly 
soaked, conferring resistance to fire damage and vulnerability to lightning damage while held. 
Dropping the duck dries them off instantly.
3
A glyph of warding (3rd level, explosive, fire) is inscribed in the hallway. Circumventing this takes 
10 minutes.
4
An illusory beast stalks the hallway. The PC that witnesses it first is harried by the phantasmal 
killer spell once every hour, for the next 10 hours or until it is slain. The beast runs but if chased is 
ultimately cornered. It has the stats of a wolf but is resistant to nonmagical damage.
5
A fire trap (Room B18) is cast on a tile in the hallway. It can be spotted with a Wisdom (Perception) 
check roll of 14 or greater. PCs that can sense magic have advantage on this roll. Failure of any party 
member to spot the trap sets it off.
6-12Nothing.
13A dead blink dog lies in the hallway, covered in blood and stinger holes (stirges). Stagnant Air.
14The air is alive with 2d8+1 stirges. The stirges buzz loudly and dart back and forth across the hall.
15
A lone wight wanders the hall, seeking refuge from the infernal maze. As it spots the PCs it lets out a 
blood-curdling scream and attacks.
16
Vines cloak the walls, choking the torchlight and cutting vision in half. Lurking amongst the greenery 
are 2d6 assassin vines lying in wait for unsuspecting prey. Ambush.
17
1d4+1 vargouilles screech and whine as they corner a lone rebel goblin. The goblin is curled up in 
a ball, crying and shrieking, but the vargouilles are too loud. They are enjoying their torment of the 
goblin and suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the PCs.
18
A group of 2d6+3 goblins stumble across the PCs. These are rebel goblins making a foray into the 
goblin king’s territory and do not expect to find anyone in the maze. Confused, and unsure of the 
PCs, they do not attack. Their attitude is Friendly unless attacked.
19
One hobgoblin, mounted on a worg, and six goblin warriors hunt for rebel goblins. They are loyal and 
obedient to the goblin king but patrol the maze fearfully. If the PCs have an alliance with the goblin 
king their attitude is Indifferent (unless attacked). Otherwise, their attitude is Hostile.
20
Bartleby (Room B28) races through the maze. He knows the maze is not a safe place to be and he 
appears to be dancing around stone to stone, trying to avoid particular spots in the maze. If the 
PCs work out a deal with Bartleby, he guides them through the maze, cutting in half the number of 
random encounters the PCs must experience. Nonetheless, he does not know the way out and uses 
Survival to look for drafts and other tell-tale signs of an exit.

180
You enter a long, winding tunnel. The walls are 
covered in moss and vines and a pungent stench 
fills the air. Off in the distance, you can hear the 
sounds of various creatures, their echoes playing 
tricks along the snaking corridor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The maze is a unique feature in the Re-
gion. No groups claim it and most avoid it if possi-
ble. It is a very dangerous, ever-changing trap. The 
bugbears and hobgoblins are smart enough to avoid 
the dangers of the maze, while the goblins have 
developed a number of superstitions regarding it.
The goblin rebels use the maze to their advan-
tage. Situating themselves on the other end of the 
maze, they have a nearly impassable barrier be-
tween them and their rivals. This, coupled with the 
wild passages in the northeast, has allowed them 
to continue their existence in the Region. A few of 
the leaders of these goblins are starting to turn 
their superstitions into a counter-religion. If the 
new god is all-powerful, wouldn’t he have destroyed 
the maze for his followers? Since he has not, these 
rebel goblins believe the maze is the home of their 
old gods, the spirits in the rock their grandfathers’ 
grandfathers worshiped.
As the PCs make their way through this maze, its 
denizens and a series of traps confront them. Every 
30 minutes spent in Room B92, roll on the Special 
Encounters table, then roll on the second table for 
any special Encounter Conditions.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Unless treasure is rolled, the maze is empty 
of anything but debris and blood stains.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
roll for a Random Encounter every 15 minutes. To 
decrease the challenge, roll for a Random Encoun-
ter every hour.

An unholy feeling pervades the hall. Unsettling and sinister, this room grates on the nerves of the 
PCs, especially any clerics and paladins. Fear 14 or Unhallowed.
2A death knell echoes through the maze. Fear 12, Echoes 6.

This maze is alive with noise. Howls, chattering, low growls, and buzzing are just a few of the noises 
echoing through the halls. Distracting Noises.
4Darkness closes in around the PCs. Deep Darkness.
5A thick mist rises from every corner of the halls. Torchlight does not cut through the fog. Fog 10.
6The maze is inexplicably flooded with water. Flooded.
7A hot wind blows through the hall. Drafty, Extreme Heat.
8A cold wind chills the PCs to the bone. Drafty, Extreme Cold.
9-12
Ivy clings to the walls, blocking visibility in the hallway. Wisdom (Perception) checks are made at 
disadvantage.
13The smell of rotted flesh assaults the PC’s senses. However, there is no visible source. Stagnant Air.
14The embers of a recent fire smolder, choking the air. Smoke.
15
The air crackles with energy, making the PCs feel alive and sick all at once. Negative Energy or 
Positive Energy.
16
1d3 bugbears wait in ambush, hoping to maim or kill someone before fleeing. Have PCs make 
two Wisdom (Perception) checks, using them as a single contested Dexterity (Stealth) check, with 
disadvantage, without telling them. If not spotted, they target the weakest-looking party member as 
they pass by their hiding spot.
17The monster or trap waits in the darkness, concealing itself in the shadows. Concealment.
18Debris has been placed to block the PCs’ path. Cover (total).
19
Silence and a magic null effect pervades the area, as if the walls were closing in on the PCs. Silence. 
Creatures here reroll failed saving throws against magical effects (spells, magic items, etc.).
20Creatures are drawn here as if something unnatural calls to them. Roll two encounters.

B93-B108 . HEATHEN GOBLIN REBELS
Not all goblins fell in love with the new god. A small 
group held tight to the old ways, worshiping the 
power of the rock spirits as their ancestors had done 
for countless centuries before them. Once their king 
had been usurped, these rebellious goblins had no 
choice but to flee.
Fear of persecution overruled their fear of the 
dreaded maze to the east of the goblin lands. The 
goblins fled into its dangerous, confusing hallways 
eluding capture or other unsavory fates. Only two-
thirds of the goblins made it through the maze, but 
that was a far larger number than any of the fleeing 
rebels anticipated.
With the maze between them and their rivals, the 
goblins quickly went to work setting up a new home 
for themselves. They claimed the area in the south-
east corner of the dungeon as their own. The maze 
protects their western flank, while the wild treach-
erous passages to the north provide ample defense 
against raids by the goblin empire.
A chieftain named Guk leads these goblins. While 
not as clever as Argliss, he is smarter than most 
goblins. He is starting to think that the new deity is 
not as powerful as his supporters claim. Why has this 
deity not destroyed the maze? Why were the followers 
of the old ways allowed to escape? Guk believes the 
answer lies with his gods. The stone spirits are watch-
ing over his people and are rewarding their loyalty.
To Guk’s people the maze is not something to be 
scared of or frightened by; it is the home of their 
gods. They see now they were too ignorant to realize 
it before. Only the unwary are punished for tres-
passing in the home of the gods. Those truly devout 
and loyal can pass through as they wish. The rebels 
have used the maze to their advantage, both for 
protection and as a place from which to strike at the 
usurper’s empire.

The ground is littered with rubble and other

earthquake that shook the dungeon so long 
ago, is unclear. What is apparent however is 
that the debris makes walking through this 
area very difficult. Hazardous Footing 15.
2-14Nothing.
15
A group of 1d3+1 ethereal marauders are 
exploring the dungeon and chance upon 
the PCs. Their attitude is Indifferent unless 
attacked. The ethereal marauders are curious 
about the PCs, they are used to goblinoids 
but not much else on two legs.
16
A pack of four blink dogs lazily make their 
way through the dungeon. Their attitude is 
Indifferent unless attacked.
17
A patrol of 2d4+2 rebel goblins, led by a 
goblin mounted on a worg, wind their way 
through the dungeon. These goblins are 
rebels, fighting the goblin king’s forces. 
If the PCs are allied with the goblin king, 
their attitude is Hostile. If the PCs are allied 
with the rebel goblin faction, their attitude 
is Indifferent. Otherwise, their attitude is 
Unfriendly.

Bartleby receives advantage on Dexterity

B93. THE WATCH ROOM
When the PCs enter Room B93, read the following.
This room is filled with goblins. They stare at you 
blankly for a brief moment, before attacking.
After the PCs have dealt with the goblins, read this:
This room is small and cramped. It contains only 
an empty weapon rack against the eastern wall. 
The rebel goblins use this room as a staging area 
to launch attacks against the goblins in the west.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The rebel goblins are confused by the 
appearance of the PCs. They were planning a raid 
against the goblin king when the PCs entered the 
room. Thinking the PCs are agents of Argliss, they 
attack the PCs regardless of their true standing with 
the goblin king.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The goblins simply swarm the PCs, attacking 
them en masse. They attack the PCs closest to them 
without regard for their personal safety. They will 
not stop until either the PCs or they are subdued.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove 
two goblins.
B94 . THE SECRET ENTRANCE
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.
This small room is empty. The slate gray walls 
are blank and unadorned. On the far wall hangs 
a banner with a crude goblin sigil on it, perhaps 
defiantly opposing the goblin king.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This secret entrance is the only way into 
the rebel goblins’ new home. The rebel goblin chief-
tain, Guk, guided by the stone spirits, brought his 
people here. While Room B95 serves as their main 
hall, the goblins wisely decided to hide their new 
homes behind this hidden passage. The entrance 
is not guarded so it does not call attention to itself. 
The goblins rely on the dangers of the maze and 
the spiked pit trap (Room B1) in this room to defend 
against serious incursions from their cousins.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: A secret door in the eastern wall leads to 
Room B98. A DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check is required to locate the door’s latch, which is 
hidden behind the goblin banner. The secret door 
isn’t locked and opens easily. In the center of the 
room is a pit, carefully disguised to look like stone.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add 10 feet of depth to the spked pit trap. To reduce 
the difficulty, double the amount of temporary hit 
points granted to players caught in the trap.

183
B95. HALL OF THE REBELS
This room is huge and filled with goblins. 
Everywhere you turn you see them. Their cold, hate-
filled eyes stare back at you. A number hiss and 
spit, gripping their spears tighter. Just when you 
think the goblins will attack, a large goblin near the 
back of the room raises a hand and utters a simple 
command. The mass of goblins steps aside, forming 
a perfect aisle from the door to their chieftain.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This is the main room of the rebel 
goblins. Twenty rebel goblin warriors make their 
home here. From the hall, they meet and plan their 
raids, and the chieftain, Guk, holds what passes for 
his court. It is a simple room without ornamenta-
tion, save for a low, makeshift table in the center of 
the room and a single stool, used by Guk.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: Guk stops the goblins from attacking the PCs 
on sight. The chieftain is curious about them and 
wishes to know if they are in league with the goblin 
king, Argliss (Room B75). If the PCs convince Guk 
they are not allied with Argliss, he grants them safe 
passage through his encampment, provided the 
PCs do not disturb anything.
Guk also tries to enlist the PCs aid in his war 
against Argliss. He believes they have been brought 
to him by his gods. Why else would they be here if 
not to combat the usurper and restore order?
If Guk suspects the PCs of being allied with 
Argliss, he and the other goblins instantly turn 
Hostile and attack the PCs.
Like all rebels, these goblins lack hobgoblin 
training and the complex tactics their cousins use. 
The rebels use standard swarm tactics to over-
whelm and subdue the PCs.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add six goblins. To 
decrease the challenge, remove six.
B96 . STOREROOM
Constructed simply of gray stone, this room looks 
mostly like a makeshift storeroom. Dried rushes 
litter the floor, and the weapon racks are filled 
with spears. A few barrels are stacked against one 
wall. The remaining barrels reek of something 
unpleasant.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Located at the end of the hall, this room 
marks the beginning of the hidden goblin encamp-
ment. The rushes strewn around on the floor func-
tion as an early trespassing system. The door to the 
Rebel Barracks (Room B97) is thin, and the sound 
of anyone walking over the rushes alerts the goblins 
stationed there to potential intruders.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Allow goblins in Room B97 Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks, with advantage if the PCs walk on 
the rushes.
Treasure: A dozen short spears are stacked on 
the weapons rack and the barrels are filled with 
flammable oil.
Scaling: N/A
B97 . REBEL BARRACKS
If the goblins hear the PCs coming from Room B96, 
they fall into a defensive position, adding +4 to their 
initiative checks.
A small barrack houses a few dozen goblins, their 
spears are pointed menacingly in your direction, 
and they look ready to pounce on you at a 
moment’s notice. One goblin, dressed in a leather 
jerkin, with a badge of office affixed to its front, 
approaches you, demanding to know what you are 
doing here.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This is the first, and last, line of defense 
the rebel goblins have for their new home. Twelve 
goblins stand guard, at the ready to defend them-
selves from danger. If the PCs can convince the 
goblins they have made a pact with their chief-
tain, Guk, their attitude shifts to Indifferent. If the 
goblins believe the PCs are in league with Argliss’ 
goblins, their attitude shifts to Hostile and they 
immediately attack. If the PCs failed their Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks in Room B96, the goblins attack 
them as soon as they enter the room.
Encounter Condition: Fearless

184
Tactics: Like all rebels, these goblins lack hobgoblin 
training and the complex tactics their cousins use. 
They rely on standard swarm tactics to overwhelm 
and subdue the PCs. If given a chance, they flank a 
PC, but almost as if by accident.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add four goblins. 
To decrease the challenge, remove four.
B98 . REBEL ARMORY
Similar to the rest of the rooms in this section of 
the dungeon, this simple room is lined with weapon 
racks. Each rack holds simple, crudely crafted short 
spears. Along the back wall, a single, ornate brass-
and-iron long spear hangs by itself on the wall.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room serves as the main armory for 
the rebel goblins. Like their cousins, they still wield 
traditional spears. The weapon racks are filled with 
numerous spears, as well as an ornate long spear.
This room also contains a secret door on its 
eastern wall, requiring a DC 16 Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) check to locate. The door can be opened 
by pressing the top and bottom stones (pressure 
triggers) simultaneously. Goblins usually require a 
“boost” to open this door when passing through.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Aside from two dozen short spears, 
this room contains a masterwork longspear 
(+1 nonmagical spear).
Scaling: N/A
B100 . WEAPONSMITH
This square cell of a room is filled with long, 
straight sticks and bits of stone. In the middle of 
all this is a lone goblin, feverishly working on a new 
short spear. He does not appear to notice you... but 
maybe he does.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: The weaponsmith working here is Kr’n’g 
(a normal goblin). As long as the PCs do not dis-
rupt him, they can stay and watch him work. If they 
communicate with him he replies with grunts and 
gestures. He has work to do and cannot be both-
ered. If the rebel goblins see the PCs as enemies, he 
signals an alarm as soon as they enter. He lunges 
at the PCs with a half-made spear. 16 seconds later 
a squad of nine goblins arrive from Room B101 to 
assist the smith.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Kr’n’g defends himself against the PCs to 
the best of his ability, using the half-completed 
masterwork spear he is holding as his weapon. He 
goes on full defense each round, taking the Dodge 
action and waiting for reinforcements. After a few 
turns, Kr’n’g assumes reinforcements are on their 
way and fights less defensively. When the rein-
forcements arrive, they use standard rebel goblin 
swarm tactics.
Treasure: The room is filled with the parts to make 
three dozen masterwork spears, but nothing else.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, have 1d4 extra 
goblins arrive in the first round of combat. To 
decrease the challenge, have only five goblins arrive.
B99. SHRINE OF THE STONE SPIRITS
This room is dark and cool. The walls are dark, but 
somehow inviting as well. Scattered, seemingly 
at random, on the floor are a wide variety of 
carved stones.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room has been set up by Guk (Room 
B95) to honor the stone spirits the rebel goblins 
worship. If the PCs leave the room as they found 
it, they earn a measure of respect with the rebel 
goblins. Any alteration to the room is viewed as a 
crime and any alliance with the rebels is instantly 
terminated. Should word spread of the PCs’ actions, 
all further encounters with the rebels instantly have 
initial attitudes changed to Hostile.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 2
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Numerous carved stones line the floor. 
While they are valuable to the goblins, they are 
nearly worthless to anyone else. Argliss (Room B75) 
may find some use for them, however, and is will-
ing to offer a small reward for their retrieval.
Scaling: N/A

185
B101 . MEETING HALL
Wooden benches and tables line the walls and 
fill the room. Ten goblins, previously talking 
boisterously, grow quiet as you enter the room. 
This simply furnished room serves as the goblins’ 
communal room.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Unwelcome intruders, the PCs earn 
the glare of ten rebel goblin warriors, who have 
stopped their conversation to determine the fate of 
the PCs. As long as the attitude toward the PCs is 
not Hostile (in relation to the rebels), they are left 
alone. The goblins do not speak as long as the PCs 
are around. If the initial attitude toward the PCs 
is Hostile, or if they attack the goblins, the rebels 
assault the PCs immediately.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: These goblins have not been trained by 
the hobgoblins and do not have a handle on the 
complex tactics their cousins do. They fight with 
conviction (gaining +2 to Wisdom saving throws) 
but lack the tactical acumen of the goblins from 
the previous Section. The rebels swarm tactics and 
overwhelm the PCs, in an attempt to subdue them 
and hold them hostage.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, 
remove four.
B102 . CROWDED WORG STABLE
Growls, snapping jaws, and the stink of live 
animals, saturate the air. Four large, shaggy beasts 
are confined behind shaky-looking wooden pens. 
The wooden slats strain and buckle as the worgs 
try to free themselves. How the goblins ride these 
monsters into battle is unimaginable; the thought 
of taming them seems laughable enough.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Inside the pens, chained to the walls, are 
four worgs. They are vicious animals, slowly being 
turned mad by the Fear in this room. The goblins 
have placed them here, unsure why their tempera-
ment is so chaotic, but remain unwilling to relocate.
Encounter Condition: Fear 14, Fearless
Tactics: Since the worgs are chained up, it’s an easy 
kill if the PCs want to finish them. If the PCs get too 
close, the worgs attack. They cannot coordinate their 
attacks, however, and snap at anything in range.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
unchain the worgs. To decrease the challenge, have 
the worgs sleeping.
B103 . EMPTY WORG STABLE
The empty stable is devoid of anything of use 
to you. Hay bales line the wall and the floor 
is scattered with debris. The air is heavy and 
oppressive.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whether it was the death of a beast that 
lived here, or something else, the air in this room is 
impossible to breathe. The smell is foul and oppres-
sive, stinging the PCs’ eyes.
Encounter Condition: Negative Energy, Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs brave the odor and search the 
room, allow DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
checks to find a +1 silver dagger.
Scaling: N/A
B104 . SECRET PASSAGE
This room contains a secret door on both its east-
ern and western walls, requiring a successful DC 17 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate. The doors 
can be opened by pressing the top and bottom stones 
(pressure triggers) at the same time. Goblins usu-
ally require a “boost” to open this door when pass-
ing through.
The door on the eastern wall has a stack of barrels 
behind it, in the hopes of barring entry. A DC 14 
Athletics check is required to push it open from 
the outside.
This long, narrow corridor stretches along the 
southern end of the rebel encampment. From 
what you can tell it simply leads from one end to 
the other.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This passage is used frequently by the 
goblins, but is often kept locked or barred because 

186
whatever is living in Region C should be avoided. 
The goblins spent a great deal of time digging up 
stones and adding a spiked pit trap (Room B1) in the 
center of the hallway.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, increase depth of 
the spiked pit trap to 100 ft. To reduce the challenge, 
change the spiked pit trap to a pit trap (Room B40).
B105 . REMEMBERER'S HOVEL
Quaintly appointed, for a goblin’s home, this room 
is the most impressive in the encampment. The 
floor is covered with a rug made of some animal’s 
hide. Small carvings and markings adorn the walls. 
In the middle of the room sits a very old goblin. His 
skin is dull, leathery, and spotted.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: This room is the living quarters of the 
oldest goblin in the rebel faction. His name is 
Rememberer, and at nearly 15 years old, he is an-
cient. He is the last repository of the goblin culture 
before the coming of the new god. He remembers 
the stories and ways of his people, and gladly tells 
the PCs what he knows, hoping to find an heir for 
his knowledge before he passes into the rock. The 
PCs can learn much of the history of the goblins 
from the Rememberer. As long as the initial attitude 
does not shift to Hostile or the PCs threaten the 
Rememberer, he imparts his knowledge.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The Rememberer is quite old, and in no 
condition to fight off the PCs. Instead of fighting, 
he begins singing a song to fascinate the PCs. Allow 
the goblins in Room B101 a Wisdom (Perception) 
check each turn to hear the song. If they succeed, 
they arrive in 6d6 seconds to aid the Rememberer, 
fighting the PCs as if they had just harmed a goblin 
child. Once reinforcements arrive, they draw the 
PCs away from the Rememberer, allowing him to 
escape the room. Once safe, he flees to Room B95, 
while the goblins lead the PCs towards Room B97. 
If forced to remain in the room, the Rememberer 
aids the fighting goblins in battle. If he must escape 
he casts, expeditious retreat, and then pass without 
trace to disguise the direction he ran in.
Treasure: The Rememberer is familiar with the oral 
histones of his people. In addition, he wears a coral 
necklace (the origins of which are unknown to him) 
worth 50 gp. It is actually an Amulet of Proof against 
Detection and Location, but he doesn’t know that, 
because it doesn’t radiate magic.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
the reinforcements arrive at the end of the Remem-
berer’s first turn. To decrease the challenge, the 
reinforcements arrive at the end of the Remember-
er’s third turn.
B106 . THE REBEL CHIRURGEON
This room is a grisly mess. A few forlorn cots line 
the back wall. The lumpy shapes under the rotten 
cloth blankets leave little to the imagination. In 
the center of the room, standing over the lifeless 
body of a goblin, is the rebel’s chirurgeon, sewing 
together what is left of the dead soldier.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The goblin chirurgeon has just per-
formed surgery on a rebel goblin, to no avail. 
While Guk (Room B95) calls upon the power of the 
stone spirits, he’s not adept at healing. This young 
goblin chirurgeon has been tasked with fixing the 
raiders that return to the encampment, which is 
becoming more and more of a losing proposition. 
He is frightened and skittish and does not like the 
presence of the PCs one bit. Black, his bat familiar, 
is here too.
If attacked the chirurgeon flees, crying for help. 
If he alerts the guards housed in Room B97, they 
arrive a turn later.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The chirurgeon does everything in his power 
to escape the PCs. While he has a few spells at his 
disposal, he casts burning hands if cornered and 
sleep if he sees someone casting spells. Once the 
guards arrive they assist the chirurgeon and attack 
the PCs. Like all rebels, these goblins lack hobgob-
lin training and the complex tactics their cousins 
use. The rebels use standard swarm tactics to over-
whelm and subdue the PCs. They guard the adept 
as best as they can, and look menacing if necessary.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add four goblins. 
To decrease the challenge, remove four goblins.

187
B107. GUK'S QUARTERS
Large and empty, this room is much nicer than 
others in the area. While spartan, a large sleeping 
area has been made up in the middle of the 
room, and various hides and weapons cover 
the walls. Leaning against the back wall is a 
club, with a wicked-looking spike of iron driven 
through its head.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Guk (Room B95) and the majority of 
rebels, aside from those in the secret encampment, 
are still in Room B95. If the PCs have gotten this far 
they either have Guk’s trust, or the PCs have already 
dealt with the rebel chieftain.
The hides and weapons on the walls are testa-
ments to the goblin kings of the past. They are all 
Guk could smuggle out during his exodus from 
Argliss’ regime. Guk’s personal greatclub is here; he 
does not feel he needs to wield it in the safety of his 
own hall and leaves it in this room when he is not 
raiding his cousins to the west.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs have somehow yet to meet Guk, 
there is a 50% chance he is here alone, and startled 
to find strangers in his quarters. His initial attitude 
is Unfriendly, as he does not trust foreigners.
Treasure: Guk’s +1 greatclub is the only significant 
treasure in the room. The weapons on the walls are 
standard spears and short swords. They are all old 
and rusty, however.
Scaling: N/A
B108. REBEL GUARD ROOM
This room, like many in this area, is filled with 
spear-wielding goblins. Along the north wall is a 
weapon rack filled with sharpened wooden spears 
and javelins. Apparently nothing has threatened 
them recently, as they look quite bored and eager 
for a fight.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This room is staffed by ten of Guk’s 
goblin warriors. They monitor the northern passag-
es for incursions by the goblin king’s forces. Occa-
sionally they hunt the creatures that wander into 
these halls from the untamed rooms (Rooms B109 
through B131).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: These goblins are bored and agitated with 
their assignment. They are looking for anything 
distracting. If their attitude with the PCs is anything 
but Hostile, they strike up a conversation (in Goblin) 
or offer to play knucklebones or cards. If the PCs 
have Guk’s favor, they even offer them places to sit 
and relax, eager for company.
If the attitude is currently Hostile, the rebel 
goblins tear into the PCs, fighting with a fierceness 
they have not seen in goblins. Treat the goblins as 
enraged (per the barbarian rage class ability) and 
give them a +2 to their initiative.
Like all rebels, these goblins have not been 
trained by the hobgoblins and do not have the 
complex tactics their cousins do. However, they are 
fond of flanking and poking the PCs at every turn. 
One of them has a vial of acid and another one has 
dragon bile smeared on his blade (3 doses). Any 
goblin that cannot get in to fight the PCs, throws a 
spear (increase their “shortbow” damage to 1d8 to 
represent this) overhead in an attempt to harm PC 
spellcasters and those hanging back. They move to 
the weapon’s rack to retrieve more if necessary.
Treasure: There are three spears and three javelins for 
every goblin in a weapons rack along the north wall. 
It requires a bonus action to grab one. Large or 
larger creatures can grab two in one go.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove 
four goblins.

188
B109-B119 . THE UNTAMED ROOMS
None of the goblinoid races lay claim to this rub-
ble-filled expanse. The earthquake hit this part of 
the dungeon hardest. A number of the traps orig-
inally laid down have been destroyed. Blink dogs, 
dire wolves, howlers, and other monsters make their 
home in this rough expanse. Howls, high-pitched 
whining, and growls echo throughout the hallways.
The hallways are strewn with rubble and debris. 
Most of the rubble is the facing of the walls that came 
loose. Some of it is the remains of walls. The footing 
is treacherous and the wild monsters make the area 
dangerous. There are good reasons the goblinoids 
have not settled the area previously.
With the shrine to their new deity in the northeast-
ern section of this expanse, Argliss and his goblins be-
gan entering the area more frequently. They even set 
up a way station for pilgrims and scouts to stay during 
the arduous trip from their empire to the shrine.
The bugbears have used the long, dangerous trip 
of the goblins to their advantage. They too have set 
up a small bivouac. From it, they harass the goblin 
pilgrims and scouts. Their presence, coupled with the 
naturally wild monsters, makes this perhaps the most 
volatile area in the entire Region.
Each room is assumed to have Poor Footing 3 in 
addition to any other Encounter Conditions.

Two ethereal marauders investigate this room. Rubble and broken bits of some ancient trap cover 
the floor and the marauders are digging through them. They suffer disadvantage on Wisdom

Hovering over three goblin corpses is a lone howler. Since the goblins were not a challenge, the

Three wights lurk in the halls, searching for easy prey. They encounter the PCs in this rubble-strewn,

B109. PASSAGES OF DEATH
The door on the northern wall is open. Rubble and 
broken, armored skeletons, and other detritus litter 
the hall. Ominous sounds emanate from the west 
of the room, echoing off the cavernous walls. To the 
east is a small passage leading away into darkness.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: When the demon Falortuligo broke from 
its prison in Room C21, he broke into Region B 
through the doors here and finally into Room B111 
where he was killed. The skeletons are a few of the 
paladins who died fighting him.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Haunted, 
Hazardous Footing 15, Unhallowed
Tactics: Just being here should unnerve the PCs. 
The sights, sounds, and sensations of these dead 
soldiers combine to create an aura of uneasy death. 
These men died horribly. Close examination of the 
bodies shows parts of bone missing from the ribs, 
legs, jaws, and arms as if some great force tore 
them away before they died.
Treasure: There are a total of three skeletons, each 
wearing a +1 chain shirt, with masterwork long-
swords (+1 nonmagical longswords) on their belts, 
and tabards of the Order of Myrunn still hanging 
on their broken frames. One of the bodies wears a 
generic signet ring (with a cross) that can double as 
a silver holy symbol, should a PC require one.
Scaling: N/A
B110. FRIGHTENED AND ALONE
The northern door to this room is locked, requiring a 
DC 24 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to unlock. The 
southeastern door to this room is locked, requiring a 
DC 27 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to unlock.
Unless the PCs succeed at a DC 25 Dexterity 
(Stealth) check while opening the lock, read the 
following.
Sitting in the corner of this dark and empty room 
is a single goblin. His eyes are streaked with tears 
as he shakes fearfully, barely managing to hold a 
sharpened stick to defend himself.
If the PCs succeed in picking the lock quietly, read 
the following.
The room is dark and empty. In one of the comers, 
a single goblin whimpers and cries to himself. His 
hands tremble as he stares at the sharpened stick 
in his hand.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: This rebel goblin, Klibb (a normal, if 
somewhat pathetic goblin possessing an above-av-
erage Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) of +6), has been 
locked inside this room for 3 days. Fearing whatever 
is in Room B111, he locked himself in this room. 
However, in doing so, he broke off his pick in one 
of the locks and has been unable to escape. To 
make matters worse, the room is haunted and he’s 
been unable to sleep with the noises, chattering, 
and unexplained shadows hovering around him all 
night long. He’s down to one last candle for light 
but refuses to use it for fear that he may be in this 
room for a long while yet.
Encounter Condition: Haunted
Tactics: Klibb does not want to fight and gladly 
throws himself at the mercy of the PCs. If they in-
tend to kill him he greets death willingly, though if 
they leave an opening for escape he takes it. If they 
offer to let him join, he gladly accepts and escorts 
them wherever they want to go.
This is a perfect opportunity to drop a new PC 
into the group. If a goblin is not on the menu of 
acceptable races for players, replace Klibb with just 
about anything that fits, including an elf deserter 
from Region H. It makes the most sense for Klibb 
(or his replacement) to be a rogue, but if another 
goblin lies dead in the room who actually locked 
the doors from the inside, Klibb can be any class.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: Do not increase or decrease the challenge of 
this encounter.

B111. KILLING GROUNDS
This room is evil; you can feel it in your bones. 
The floor is covered in debris and is slightly tacky. 
Any sound you make, as well as a few others, echo 
throughout the chamber loudly. To say you have 
a bad feeling about this cavernous room is an 
understatement.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This is perhaps the most dangerous room 
in the entire Region. An epic battle took place here 
ages ago (see Region C) and the effects of the battle 
still linger. The conditions of the room are tough 
to handle, but that is not the worst of it. Soon 
after the PCs enter the room, six corrupted ghoul 
paladins—dressed in magical chain mail, carry-
ing unholy swords, and wearing the tabards of the 
Order of Myrunn—attack the PCs. They are fearless 
and descend without hesitation, merely waiting for 
the appropriate moment to strike.
They do not look like typical ghouls. While their 
skin is tight, eyes hollow, and claws sharpened to 
razor-like perfection, they carry themselves with re-
gal authority and wield swords as though they were 
born to. Their helmets hide everything but their 
fangs and empty eyes. Their weapons gleam with 
unnerving energy.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Concealment, Cursed 
5, Desecration 6, Echoes 10, Fear 14, Fearless, 
Haunted, Hazardous Footing 16, Negative Energy, 
Unhallowed
Tactics: The ghouls alternate between bite, claw, and 
longsword attacks. They know that a paralyzed vic-
tim is easier to subdue, but they cannot deny their 
paladin heritage. They maintain an aura of fear, in 
addition to the Fear effect of the room.
The ghouls work like a team, ganging up on 
stragglers and distracting the weak. They have a 
strong hatred for clerics and wizards (seeing Arum 
as the cause of their death). They do not put them-
selves in harm’s way but do their best to kill spell-
casters before they can “boost” the PCs.
If the PCs cannot dispatch the ghouls quickly 
enough, they run the risk of drawing the atten-
tion of other nearby monsters. After 11 rounds of 
combat, roll for a Random Encounter. If the result 
is odd, the Random Encounter occurs, forcing the 
PCs to deal with even more foes. If not, roll again 
on the 12th round of combat. If the result is even, 
the Random Encounter occurs. Do not roll for fur-
ther encounters beyond this point.
Treasure: Having rotted their magical weapons and 
armor from their caustic and unholy touch, their 
swords and chain shirts turn to dust when the 
ghouls die.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one corrupted paladin. To decrease the chal-
lenge, remove the magical arms and armor from 
the corrupted paladins.

B112-B115 . PRISON CELLS
While part and parcel of the surrounding Section, these four rooms have specific significance. They are prison 
cells that at one time or another held demons, devils, and undead. Some of the rooms still have occupants
B112 . DARKNESS AGAIN
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. Unlike 
the other rooms in this area, the glyph on this door 
triggers the door to open when read.
This simple room is empty and dark. Light recedes 
and dissipates, almost swallowed by the darkness. 
The floor, from what you can see, is strangely 
free of dust.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whatever once lived here is gone, having 
escaped when a foolish goblin read the glyph on the 
door. Most likely a wight, it either escaped into the 
dungeon or was killed by the ghouls in Room B111.
Encounter Condition: Deep Darkness, Desecration 3, 
Negative Energy
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs spend 30 minutes searching the 
room (and have adequate light), allow a DC 20 In-
telligence (Investigation) check to find a loose stone 
in the floor. A DC 11 Strength (Athletics) check lifts 
the stone from its perch. The stone is nearly 200 
lbs. and covers a small area the size of a halfling. 
Buried under the stone is a suit of +1 unholy splint 
mail, obviously hidden away so it could never be 
used against the forces of good. It radiates evil and 
afflicts good-aligned PCs who don it with a Har-
rowing Curse.
Unholy armor grants resistance to damage 
dealt by good-aligned creatures. In addition, when 
the wearer is struck, the attacker must succeed a 
Charisma saving throw (DC 14) or be afflicted with a 
Harrowing Curse.
 '
Harrowing Curse. Until it is removed, or one week 
passes, cursed creatures that roll initiative must 
succeed a Wisdom saving throw (DC 14) or be 
frightened of all undead for 10 turns. The save may 
be repeated at the end of each of their turns. Crea-
tures already in combat when this curse is applied 
must immediately make the save again.
Scaling: N/A
B113 . TRAPPED WIGHT
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 24 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. In ad-
dition, the door is trapped with a glyph of warding, 
protecting the contents of the room from escape. 
Tampering with the door or lock in any manner 
triggers it.
A small tomb-like room rests to the northeast of 
the large circular room. The contents are spartan 
and darkness extends to every comer. Before you 
can think, something has crept from the shadows.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Two insane wights have been trapped in 
this room since its creation. Being undead, they 
do not understand the passage of time as humans 
do but nonetheless have maintained a semblance 
of reality that finally drove them mad. Insane, they 
howl with an allip-like moan.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Distract-
ing Noises, Fear 15, Fearless, Unhallowed
Tactics: The insane wights attack immediately, taking 
advantage of surprised PCs. They babble incessant-
ly, as they attack each PC in turn.
Treasure: If the PCs have adequate light, allow a 
DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find a 
series of loose flagstones in the floor. Buried under 
the stones is a +1 unholy morningstar, obviously 
hidden away so it could never be used against the 
forces of good. A DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check 
lifts the stones.
Unholy weapons deal an extra 1d4 necrotic dam-
age to good-aligned creatures. In addition, when a 
creature is struck by the weapon, it must succeed a 
Charisma save (DC 14) or be afflicted with a Har-
rowing Curse (Room 112). Good-aligned creatures 
touching unholy weapons are instantly afflicted 
with the curse.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one wight. To decrease the challenge, remove 
the allip-like babbling ability from the wights.

and all the doors are locked and guarded by glyphs. GMs can describe the doors while the PCs stand in 
Room B111, but until they touch them, there is no chance of knowing what will happen.
B114 . HELL ON EVERY EARTH
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. In addi-
tion, the door is trapped with a glyph of warding (3rd 
level, explosive, thunder), protecting the contents of 
the room from escape. Tampering with the door or 
lock in any manner triggers it.
From the darkness, you can hear an unhealthy 
moan, something sinister and decrepit. The 
darkness cuts your torchlight and the moan grows 
louder as you peer into the shadows.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A ghast of unusual strength has been 
trapped in this room since the dungeon’s creation. 
Once shackled, it broke those bonds long ago. Now 
the manacles and chains hang from a metal ring in 
the wall. The floor is littered with sepsis and slime, 
making walking difficult.
The ghast has no love of the living and attacks 
immediately.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Conceal-
ment, Fearless, Poor Footing 4, Unhallowed
Tactics: Taking advantage of the darkness, the ghast 
rushes the first PC, in an attempt to pin him. Using 
the darkness to his advantage he gains a +4 to 
his Strength check to grapple them. Once on the 
ground, he attacks ferociously, biting and clawing 
until the victim is paralyzed. He then moves on to 
the next victim using the same tactics, paralyzing 
the PC and moving on to the next.
The ghast is a fearsome predator and uses its 
mechanisms to finish off the PCs.
Treasure: If the PCs spend 30 minutes searching the 
room (and have adequate light), they can find a bro-
ken stone in the floor. A DC 9 Strength (Athletics) 
check lifts the pieces of broken stone easily. Noth-
ing is buried here, having been taken by the ghast.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, give the ghast +3 
AC. To reduce the challenge, remove the ghast’s 
teeth, forcing it to fight only with its claws.
B115 . SEVERED VARGOUILLES
From outside the door, the PCs can hear the muf-
fled shriek of something far off. In actuality, the 
vargouilles inside are shrieking at a fever pitch, but 
the walls of the dungeon suppress the volume of 
their screams. As soon as the door is opened, the 
shriek hits them at full volume.
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. In addi-
tion, the door is trapped with a glyph of warding (3rd 
level, explosive, fire), preventing the contents of the 
room from escaping. Tampering with the door or lock 
in any manner triggers it.
As soon as the door opens a feverish shriek 
blasts your senses, striking your psyche with an 
impossibly loud sound. The room, shrouded in 
darkness, shows no signs of occupants, but the 
shrieks cannot be ignored.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: From the darkness, four vargouilles shriek 
and scream. The PCs cannot see them because it’s 
dark, but if they can get closer, they see four heads 
spiked to iron rods in the wall, some ten feet above 
the floor. Striking them should be easy enough, 
should the PCs have a weapon that can reach them.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Distracting 
Noises, Deep Darkness, Fear 14
Tactics: The vargouilles are spiked to the walls, un-
able to move, but unwilling to die. They have been 
shrieking for thousands of years, trapped in this 
constant state of agony. Unable to deny their un-
holy heritage, they scream continuously, no matter 
what the PCs do. They cannot move, and want noth-
ing more than to be free of this living hell they are 
trapped in. Death is the most obvious answer, but 
escape is their goal.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, do not have the 
vargouilles spiked to the wall but flying about at 
will. To decrease the challenge, reduce each var-
gouille to 1 hit point each, representing the con-
stant state of near death that they “live” in.

193
B116 . ISOLATED REBELS
As the PCs approach this room, allow Wisdom 
(Perception) checks to overhear the goblins inside, 
counting and bickering. While not hostile toward 
one another, or shouting, they are busy dividing up 
their loot.
There is a 50% chance one goblin stands guard in 
front of the door. Otherwise, everyone is inside, with 
one goblin watching the door from the back wall.
This small, cramped room is filled with rebel goblin 
warriors, sitting down and sifting through a small 
pile of coins and gems. Before you can do anything, 
they grab their spears and attack.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Nine goblin warriors left Room B108 out 
of boredom. Wishing to explore the dungeon, they 
braved the maze, snuck passed the goblins in Room 
B86 and so on, and made their way through the 
trapped rooms in the center of the Region.
None of this was difficult, but the goblin keeping 
track of where they were going died under a port-
cullis trap and they have been stuck in this Section 
for weeks now. The other goblins in the rebel en-
campment presume they are dead. Since they have 
been gone for so long, they do not know whether 
the PCs are loyal to the rebels or not. As such, they 
are treated no better than their traitorous cousins. 
Unless the PCs can show some sign of their alle-
giance to the rebel goblins (and quickly), they are 
attacked as soon as the PCs enter the room.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises
Tactics: These goblins are ragged and frazzled, their 
mental state shaken for the duration of this fight. 
They attack with an intense need to kill. The PCs 
should be allowed a chance to calm them down 
(spells work, for instance). If 50% of the goblins 
come to their senses, they all stop fighting and in-
vite the PCs in, hoping they can guide them home.
The goblins have encountered the blink dogs in 
Room B117 but keep to themselves, knowing better 
than to antagonize the beasts.
Treasure: While exploring, they were able to collect 
a small pile of treasure that they were divvying up 
(for the 40th time) when the PCs interrupted. There 
are 116 sp, 23 gp, an uncut sapphire (350 gp), and a 
potion of gaseous form.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add three goblins. 
To decrease the challenge, remove two.
B117 . BLINK DOG DEN
The door to this room is open, its lock broken.
In the midst of all the chaos in this section of 
the dungeon, this room feels safe. An easy calm 
washes over you and the room itself seems to be 
an enticing place to rest. The peace is broken as a 
series of low growls fill the air.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The PCs have entered a blink dog den. 
Resting from the rigors of the Section, four blink 
dogs (hp 40, 32, 24, 14) rest on beds of cloth and 
adventuring gear. They do not attack the PCs initial-
ly, but they make their dislike of the PCs’ invasion 
clear. The blink dogs bare their fangs, growling 
and yapping at the PCs. If the PCs do not leave, the 
blink dogs slowly advance, hoping to drive them off. 
If any PCs attack, they immediately retaliate.
Any ranger or druid amongst the PCs can at-
tempt a DC 20 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check 
to calm the dogs. Success allows the PCs to remain 
and rest in the room though the blink dogs are 
obviously not pleased with the PCs’ presence.
Encounter Condition: [Safe]
Tactics: The three largest blink dogs launch them-
selves at the PCs, with the alpha male protecting 
the smallest and youngest blink dog. They focus on 
the most aggressive PCs first, concentrating on one 
enemy at a time. They use their limited blink ability 
to flank the PCs.
If the alpha male is killed, the second largest 
takes command of the pack. If it dies, the remain-
ing blink dogs cower in a comer until the PCs leave 
or finish them off.
The smallest is too old to train at this point, 
having been feral too long to be of use to animal 
trainers. However, since blink dogs are lawful 
good creatures, they prefer not to fight. But be-
ing trapped in the dungeon, they grow more and 
more feral with the passage of time. Rangers and 
druids may attempt to calm the blink dogs, requir-
ing a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check in place of 
Charisma (Diplomacy) checks. If the PCs remain for 
2 hours or more, another check is required, lest the 
alpha male grow restless.
If the PCs clear the goblins out of B116 and keep 
the portcullis in Room B118 down, this room is 
considered Safe.

194
Treasure: Among the adventuring gear the blink dogs 
were resting on are two coils of 50 ft. rope, a back-
pack, six candles, a tinder box, a rusty carving knife, 
and a waterskin filled with holy water.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one blink dog. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.
B118 . MOSS-FILLED GUARD 
CHAMBER
The portcullis blocking the PC’s path is down. In or-
der to open it, the PCs must pull the lever (inside the 
room) down.
Deep green moss covers the walls and ceiling of 
this room. The only bare stone is the floor. The 
moss is rich and thick, taking on the appearance 
of an expensive carpet. The air in this room is 
thick and pungent as well. The moss appears to be 
sucking all the freshness out of the room. Along the 
west wall, a lever juts out.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The walls and ceiling of this room are the 
remnants of an ancient celestial trap that was dam-
aged in the earthquake. Touching the lever triggers 
a poison dust trap, but opens the portcullis.
 '
Poison Dust Trap. Hidden inside the lever compart-
ment is a glass vial (visible with a DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception check)). Pulling the lever crushes the 
vial releasing a puff of noxious gas. Creatures 
within 5 ft of the lever must succeed a Constitution 
saving throw (DC 15) or be poisoned for 1 hour. If 
the poison is not cured before that time the victim 
receives 5d10 poison damage when it ends. A DC 14 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check is required to 
pull the vial out without dropping it, which would 
set it off.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: Along the western wall is a lever that, when 
pulled down, raises the portcullis in the hallway. 
When pushed up, the portcullis lowers.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the poison dust trap’s effect with insanity 
mist vapor (Room B8). To decrease the challenge, 
remove the trap and raise the portcullis.
B119 . ABANDONED OUTPOST
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 30 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. The door 
can be locked from the inside or outside.
This room was once an outpost of some sort; that 
much is obvious at least. A rotted framework, 
probably for bunk beds, leans against one wall. A 
large, stained table takes up the center of the room. 
On the eastern wall, there is a slight discoloration 
in the center from a map that once hung there. 
Along the back wall is a weapons rack.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This outpost has been abandoned for 
a long time. The furniture is old, and the floor is 
littered with rubble and debris.
No matter how long the PCs search the room, 
they cannot determine who used the room, or what 
they used it for; it dates back to the time of the 
battle that took place in Room B111. The map that 
hung on the wall has long since been destroyed, 
and the only things on the table are dark stains. The 
weapon rack in the back of the room seems to be in 
decent repair and still holds a few weapons.
Encounter Condition: Hazardous Footing 5, [Safe]
Tactics: If the PCs lock the door from the inside, 
nothing can get in to disturb them. The locals con-
sider this room unreachable anyway.
Treasure: At first glance, the weapon’s rack appears 
trapped, but a DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check reveals that the trigger is fake, designed to 
trick would-be thieves. Over the years the “tripline” 
has rotted and nothing resembling a trap remains.
The weapons of a long-dead soldier hang on the 
weapon rack, holding a +1 longbow and a +1 buckler 
in addition to a few mundane odds and ends. The 
GM should place a few javelins and arrows on the 
rack for PCs to replenish their supplies.
Scaling: N/A

B120-B132 . RUINS
The fallout from the earthquake can still be felt here. 
Doors are broken open from the inside. Unholy 
screams fill the corridors. And everywhere the PCs go, 
the smell of death follows them. This place is unfit for 
the living... let alone the dead.
Unlike the majority of the Region, this expanse suf-
fered real damage. The halls are strewn with rubble 
and debris that make traversing them an adventure 
in and of itself. Doors are broken from the inside, 
hanging on their hinges, allowing a glimpse into the 
shadowy confines of the rooms beyond. On top of 
all the damage, there is still the matter of the inhabi-
tants wandering the halls.
The goblins and bugbears may have control over 
their respective sections, but this section is ruled by 
wild creatures and untamed monsters. This makes 
pilgrimages to the shrine that much more difficult as 
beasts threaten the goblins at every turn. This Section 
is not safe.
To add to the disturbing nature of the Section, the 
stench of death and decay permeates the very air. The 
creatures here do not coexist peacefully and between 
their encounters with each other and the goblins that 
enter this area surreptitiously. The results of various 
conflicts have saturated the dungeon. Dark stains, 
scattered bones, and broken weapons mark the vio-
lence of these meetings. Compared to the relatively 
spartan and benign rooms in the other areas, this 
entire section radiates a dangerous aura.
The GM should add the following Encounter Con-
ditions as he sees fit: Echoes 4, Poor Footing 4, and 
Stagnant Air.
Every room’s door is either open or broken off.

B120 . THE CROSSROADS
The enormity of this room astounds you. Its sheer, 
white walls and bleached granite ceiling are truly 
impressive. Less impressive are the red scrawled 
runes carved and painted on the walls. The writing 
is hard to decipher, but it appears to be a series of 
taunts and proclamations from one group to the 
other. The center of the room is likewise stained. 
Upon closer inspection, it appears to be blood.
In addition to the room’s decor, there is an 
unmistakable smell of rot. While the smell isn’t 
overpowering, it isn’t comfortable either.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Bugbears use this room to lure their en-
emies into a series of traps, all simple but effective. 
Typically, the bugbears run through the room, and 
exit through any one of a number of doors, press-
ing hidden triggers as they go. In actuality, this trick 
has worked nearly a dozen times, and each time the 
bugbears reset the traps, they prepare for another 
wave of gullible victims.
Pressure-sensitive plates underneath the floor 
trigger the first trap, which in turn triggers two 
more. PCs stepping across the floor require a DC 12 
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check 
to avoid triggering the first hail of needles trap. PCs 
that are moving quickly suffer disadvantage on 
this check.
After the hail of needles trap (Room B35), a poison 
dust trap (Room B118) goes off, followed by a spiked 
pit trap (Room B1) in the floor (with a 6-second gap 
between each trap). To make matters worse, the pit 
is lined with spikes. Presently three dead goblins 
line the bottom of the pit, all of which are decom-
posing and covered in maggots.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: To safely cross the room the PCs need to lo-
cate the reset mechanism, which is located beneath 
a chipped tile in the northwestern corner of the 
room. There are three separate triggers, each to a 
different trap. A fourth trigger leads to the delay 
between the traps, allowing the PCs the opportunity 
to alter the intervals between the traps from 1 round 
to 6 rounds. This requires a DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight 
of Hand) check.
There is a 10% chance that two bugbears are in 
this room resetting and rearming the traps. If so, 
they are Unfriendly to the PCs, having never seen 
humans (etc.) before.
Treasure: Tucked in the southwest corner are two 
dead goblins, maybe 2 or 3 days old. They are cov-
ered in needles and their clothing is torn to shreds. 
The PCs require a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) or 
DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find 
these bodies. They have 1d4 sp each in their mauled 
pockets, but the bugbears have stripped everything 
else away.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a fire trap (Room B18) that goes off at the bot-
tom of the pit. To decrease the challenge, remove 
the fungal dust vapor trap.
B121 . BUGBEAR BIVOUAC
This small room has been taken over by a group of 
bugbears. They bark and growl at you as you enter, 
tightening their grip on their clubs. The bugbears 
seem wary and tired, waiting for you to make the 
first move.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Three bugbear soldiers use this location 
to harass the goblin pilgrims traveling to the shrine 
(Room B134). Any disruption of the goblin king’s 
minions is seen as a victory to the bugbears and 
they take full advantage of the long trip many gob-
lins make to visit their deity.
If the PCs can convince the bugbears they are 
friends, their attitude shifts to Indifferent and they 
allow the PCs to make use of the room to rest. If 
the bugbears believe the PCs are allied with either 
faction of goblins, their attitude instantly becomes 
Hostile and they attack the PCs.
Encounter Condition: [Safe]
Tactics: The bugbears know they are outmatched, and 
avoid a fight if possible. They gang up on the near-
est PC and use them as a human shield if possible. 
They stay close together, making sure they cannot 
be flanked, engaging the PCs en masse only when 
safe, and taking down opponents as quickly as pos-
sible—they know the cost of a protracted fight.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one bugbear and change their initial attitude to 
Hostile. To decrease the challenge, have the bug-
bears out on patrol, only to return in 1d6 minutes.

197
B122 . WAYWARD AND LOST
Have the effects of this room carry out 30 ft. or so 
from the room, causing the PCs to become confused 
before they reach the interior. The doors to this room 
are broken or missing.
All around you, the walls and floor dance with 
wavy heat lines, moving from you. Your vision 
blurs and the boundaries of the room grow more 
confusing, shifting in front of you. Suddenly your 
ears begin to ring and your balance is disrupted. 
On the ground, dead bodies of goblins and wolves 
twist and writhe. Their heads move as though 
barking, but no sound comes out.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whatever magic created in this room 
has become tainted, twisting the PC’s minds and 
feeding them hallucinations. This takes effect every 
1d4 minutes (per PC) and the effects are cumulative 
(frightened becomes restrained, restrained becomes 
paralyzed), so spending long in this room can be 
dangerous for the PC’s well-being.
Encounter Condition: Deep Silence, Fear 15
Tactics: PCs remaining in the room suffer the effects 
of confusion (no save) until they leave. The GM is 
encouraged to make the room difficult to escape.
Treasure: The goblins each carry 1d3 mundane items 
and there is one minor magic item under the body 
of the dire wolf, but the PCs are lucky to escape this 
room, let alone find time to search the dead.
Scaling: N/A
B123 . PIT OF DESPAIR
A deep pit takes up the center of this room. The 
walls have been broken from the weight of extreme 
stress, and gears and other mechanical devices 
are exposed. Obviously, a trap of some sort was 
the centerpiece of this room at one point, but it 
appears to be inoperable now. Still, for a room that 
seems relatively safe, why do you feel so unnerved?
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Once a great celestial trap filled this 
room, now the innards of the trap lay exposed. It 
was either damaged by the great earthquake or 
ruined by the bugbears; it is impossible to be sure.
There is a presence in the room, be it a creature 
that fell to the trap while it was still active, or some-
thing living at the bottom of the pit, and it is quite 
unnerving. The longer the PCs stay in this room, 
the more unnerved they become.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Distracting 
Visions, Echoes, Fear 15, Haunted
Tactics: For every hour the PCs spend in this room, 
they must make another fear save, increasing the 
DC by +1 for every previous check.
Treasure: A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals 
a series of claw marks in the stone that could only 
come from the acidic touch of a demon or other 
creature. The stone is still hot from whatever made 
the marks. The marks radiate evil and strong trans-
mutation. If the PCs spend 30 minutes collecting 
the molten pieces of stone from the wall, they can 
use them as special material components for 1d3 
castings. Usable for any spell with a duration or 
range, the stones, touched by great evil, taint the 
magic with evil energy, doubling the duration and 
range of the spell. A DC 25 Intellegince (Arcana) 
check reveals that the molten stone (once chipped 
away) can aid their castings of spells.
Scaling: N/A

B124. CRYPT OF THE HOBGOBLIN KINGS
The door on the northeastern wall is open.
This room is filled with rubble and debris. Most of 
it appears to have been a part of a large statue at 
some point. The details have been destroyed, but 
from what you can tell it looks like the statue was 
of a fearsome celestial. A haze of smoke fills the 
ceiling, giving the impression that something (or 
someone) was burned here recently. A slag of cloth 
and flesh rests against the north wall, just below 
the broken statue.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room served as a burial place for var-
ious creatures in the Section. The statue, thought of 
as a guardian, or watcher of the dead, was offered 
burnt remains or whatever religious items of signif-
icance could be procured by visitors. Various races 
have used this room over the years and presently, 
the bugbears use it to burn their dead.
Even though the statue has crumbled with age 
and as a result of neglect, the creatures in the 
Section treat it with reverence. From time to time, 
whatever they can find is offered and laid to rest at 
its base. Usually, these coins and trinkets are taken 
by foolish or greedy goblins, but from time to time 
a small pile of silver can be found here.
Encounter Condition: Hazardous Footing 5, 
Positive Energy
Tactics: Sifting through the debris should take some 
time. A Random Encounter every 45 minutes or 
so is a good way to convince the PCs not to “hang 
around” too long.
Treasure: In the northwest corner of the room, under 
a large stone, is a hidden compartment, cut out 
from the floor. The compartment is about the size 
of a small coffin and requires a successful Wisdom 
(Perception) check (DC 18) to locate. The compart-
ment has become a repository for discarded items. 
Various tremors in the room have buried it, howev-
er, and no one has “donated” to the compartment 
in years. A few discarded weapons and trinkets 
can be found as well as a +1 steel shield, and three 
potions of giant strength. If the GM likes, add a few 
hundred silver pieces as well.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add the Encounter Condition: Smoke. To decrease 
the challenge, remove the Hazardous Footing 5 
Encounter Condition.
B125. FIGHT FOR DOMINANCE
The north and south doors to this room are open.
As the PCs approach, allow them Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks to hear the fighting, growling, and 
baying taking place in this room. Otherwise, they only 
hear the animals after they open one of the doors.
Three yellow-brown hounds are fighting against a 
pair of large, feral wolves. They snarl and bark at 
one another, neither giving in nor backing down. 
The fighting is quick and brutal.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: If the PCs remain still, the three blink 
dogs and two dire wolves continue fighting (al-
though allow Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice 
the PCs). If the fight continues, both groups bite 
and attack one another until they are at 50% hit 
points at which point they flee north (dire wolves) 
and south (blink dogs). The wolves wear collars, 
indicating that someone possibly “owns” them.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs are noticed, both groups turn 
their attention and attack, splitting their energies 
between the PCs and their four-legged enemies. 
The GM should “mix it up” and make this melee as 
chaotic as it sounds.
The blink dogs here, while neutral good, are in 
a state of fury and not willing to explore whether 
the PCs are “good” or not. Consider these animals 
enraged (per the barbarian's rage class feature).
Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks are made at 
disadvantage.
Treasure: The wolves wear nice leather collars, but 
nothing else of value is in this room. Heavy traffic 
keeps it clear of debris.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one dire wolf and two blink dogs. To decrease 
the challenge, remove one dire wolf.

B126. CELESTIAL OBSERVATORY
The northern door to this room is locked and cannot 
be opened without the key in Room C105.
This room is a mess of rubble and cracked stone. 
After careful examination you can make out the 
remains of a stone desk and chair along one 
side of the room. Towards the back of the room 
are the broken pieces of what could only be a 
bookcase or shelf.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The purpose of this room has been lost to 
the ages, but it looks like many of the observation 
chambers from this Region. Unlike the other locked 
doors leading north into Region F, the one in this 
room is trapped. If the PCs touch or in any way 
interact with the door short of placing the correct 
key in the door, hold monster is cast at 5th level (spell 
save DC 16) on the closest PC.
Encounter Condition: Hazardous Footing 10
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs spend 30 minutes sifting through 
the debris allow them a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to find a pair of dimensional shackles under 
some of the stones. The shackles radiate evil and 
have blood caked on them from centuries of use.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a glyph of warding (3rd level, explosive, necrotic). 
To decrease the challenge, replace the hold monster 
with chill touch (cast as if by a level 5).
B127 . DIRE WOLF DEN
The door to this room is broken off the hinges.
A large room extends into the darkness. You hear 
low growls erupting from what you can only 
assume are wolves or hounds. The room appears 
empty, but the smell of wet, dirty fur indicates 
something is living here.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: There are three dire wolves in this room 
and they do not take kindly to the intruders in their 
home. They are resting in the shadowy northern 
half of the room. They can see the PCs at the door-
way, and they wait until the first PC enters the room 
to attack. If they surprise the PCs, they gain a +2 to 
their initiative.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), 
Concealment
Tactics: The dire wolves fight as a pack, concentrat-
ing their attacks against one PC at a time. While 
one draws the attention of the PC, the other two 
flank them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one dire wolf. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.
B128 . HALLOWED GROUND
While the door to this room can be locked, it is 
presently unlocked. In order to lock it, the PCs must 
succeed at a DC 25 Sleight of Hand check.
Soothing energy fills this room. Being here 
lightens your heart and the aches and pains 
you’ve accumulated during your adventures wash 
away, becoming dull afterthoughts. The room is 
unadorned, but that only adds to the peaceful 
feeling washing over you. A single pedestal with a 
bowl on top of it rests against the back wall.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: There is a soothing calm to the room and 
the locals often rest here. This room is Safe, so long 
as the PCs lock the door behind them.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 10, Positive En-
ergy, [Safe]
Tactics: If the PCs lock the door behind them, they 
can safely rest here for 1d12 hours without interrup-
tion. After that, the GM should roll for a Random 
Encounter. If a trap is rolled, ignore it, and if a crea-
ture is rolled, it tries to open the door, picking the 
lock or pounding on it for entry. If this occurs, the 
room isn’t considered Safe again for 1d3 days.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A

B129. THE LAST STAND AGAINST THE FINAL OPTION
The door on the east wall is locked and barred. 
Opening it from the outside requires a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check and a DC 20 
Strength (Athletics) check.
This room is small and empty, with three doors. 
Each leads deeper into the dungeon. The simple 
granite walls look untouched, and faint outlines 
of footprints layer the dust on the floor. A crack 
separates the two halves of the ceiling.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is equipped with a mighty 
swinging pendulum, one of the many traps the 
bugbears have designed to keep creatures from 
Region B from getting in. The trap is triggered 16 
seconds after any door is opened.
The trap’s reset mechanism is located to the west 
wall, under a loose stone. A DC 10 Sleight of Hand 
check is required to lift the stone gingerly enough 
not to trigger a chill touch spell (targeted at that 
creature, cast at level 5) protecting the reset plate. 
Disabling the reset mechanism prevents the trap 
from triggering for 1d3 days.
 '
Pendulum Trap. Once activated, creatures within a 
5 ft. line running the exact center of the room from 
end to end must succeed a Dexterity saving throw 
(DC 15) or take 5d8 damage. Creatures that save 
only receive half. This effect repeats every few sec-
onds, slowing down and dealing one less d8 until it 
comes to a stop at zero.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the damage dealt by the pendulum to mag-
ical necrotic damage. To decrease the challenge, 
remove the chill touch trap.
B130. GOBLIN PILGRIMS
Allow the PCs Wisdom (Perception) checks to over-
hear the talking going on inside this room.
A ragtag group of goblins takes refuge in this 
expanded hall. Their chanting is unnatural 
sounding and highly disconcerting.
If the PCs succeed at a DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) 
check as they open the door, read the following.
They don’t seem to notice you as they are 
completely enraptured by the tokens and trinkets 
they’ve collected into a pile on the floor.
Otherwise, read the following.
Cackling and shrieking, they rise in unison. With 
one mind the goblins gather their weapons.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Six goblin warriors have made the long 
journey from the goblin empire to the shrine of 
their deity. They have collected about 20 gp worth of 
“junk” that they intend to offer to the goblin shrine 
(Room B134). Having traveled a great distance to 
get here and having fought off numerous creatures 
along the way, they are not about to back down 
from the “heathen” PCs. Seeing the PCs as defilers, 
the goblin pilgrims viciously assault the PCs, not 
offering them a chance to “talk.”
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4, Fearless
Tactics: If the goblins are not surprised, they attack 
the PCs in a massive swarm, concentrating their at-
tacks on whomever is closest. The goblins continue 
fighting even when an opponent falls. Zealous, they 
jump on and lash out at their victim continuously 
until there is nothing left. The largest of the goblins 
goes so far as to bite (action, guaranteed hit, 1d2 
points of damage), once an opponent is downed.
Treasure: There are about 5 lbs. of trinkets that collec-
tively equal about 20 gp in value.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add six goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove 
two goblins.

B131 HIDDEN PRISON
The door is locked and requires a DC 24 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to open. It relocks automati-
cally, so the PCs must unlock and push it open in one 
swift motion, lest the door locks again immediately.
As you enter the room a chill runs down your back 
and your arms. The room, simple and bare, seems 
devoid of life. The smooth floor, the high ceiling, 
and the darkness make you feel like you’ve stepped 
into a tower belfry. An ominous moan fills the air, 
followed by a chill wind.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Before the PCs can think, flip a coin to 
see if their torches are blown out by the draft. After 
that check to see if the PCs are surprised by the four 
vargouilles’ descent upon them. The ceiling, over 
60 ft. high, hides the vargouilles from sight until 
they are ready to ambush the PCs, which happens as 
soon as one of them tampers with the lock. They are 
merciless and attack the PCs like shrieking bombers.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), 
Concealment, Desecration 4, Drafty, Extreme Cold, 
Negative Energy
Tactics: Immediately upon descending on the PCs, 
the first two vargouilles Shriek, and the next two 
(their initiative 2 lower), drop down to Kiss any PCs 
paralyzed with fear. The vargouilles continue attack-
ing with diving attacks, flying up and back around. 
Due to the darkness, ranged attacks fired up into 
the chamber suffer from concealment penalties.
They alternate between Kiss and Bite attacks, 
allowing their venom to slowly weaken PCs. Unlike 
the vargouilles in Room B114, these put up a fight.
Treasure: Should the PCs find adequate light, they 
can climb the walls of this room, to reach many of 
the shelves at the higher levels. Along the north wall 
at the 40 ft mark is a ledge 4 ft wide and 4 ft long. 
On the ledge is a small nest, with nothing in it. If 
the PC succeeds at a DC 20 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check, they find a cache in the north wall just 
above the ledge. The cache is trapped but hides a 
small strongbox.
Inside the strongbox—strapped down with silk 
ties—are six potions of healing and a ring of swim-
ming. In addition, the felt bottom of the strongbox 
is magical (faint abjuration), helping to protect 
potions and other items from shattering. If a saving 
throw is ever called for glass items stored inside 
this box, they gain advantage on that save.
Along the north wall at the 15 ft. mark is a ledge, 
4 ft. wide and 5 ft. long. It is sturdy and a perfect 
place from which to view the entire room. Offal on 
the ledge makes moving on it difficult, however 
(Hazardous Footing 14).
Along the south wall at the 40 ft. mark is a ledge, 
3 ft. wide and 4 ft. long. Along the south wall at the 
40 ft. mark is a ledge, 4 ft. wide and 2 ft. long. A 
Small or smaller creature can crouch on this ledge, 
allowing them a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check to find a loose stone in the wall, revealing 
a small cache with a small pile of gleaming bolts. 
There are five screaming bolts with continual flame 
cast on them. While not trapped, they are warm 
to the touch, which may or may not shock the PC. 
Screaming bolts frighten enemies within 15 ft, of 
them as they fly towards their target if they fail a 
DC 14 Wisdom save.
Along the east wall at the 35 ft. mark is a broken 
stone, 1 ft. wide and 2 ft. long. Along the east wall at 
the 45 ft. mark is a ledge, 2 ft. wide and 3 ft. long.
Along the west wall at the 25 ft. mark is a stone, 
2 ft. wide and 1 ft. long. Along the west wall at the 
50 ft. mark is a ledge, 4 ft. wide and 1 ft. long. It 
is nearly impossible to stand on. But tall PCs may 
use this ledge to reach a hidden shelf 6 ft. above 
the ledge. While it cannot be seen from here, it can 
be seen from the highest ledge on the north wall 
(DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check). The shelf is 3 ft. 
wide and 1 ft deep, being cut into the shape of the 
room. Resting on the shelf is a small urn, painted 
red and black and making it difficult to spot.
The urn is trapped with purple worm poison that 
has been smeared on the lid and a fire trap (Room 
B18) that ignites when the lid is removed. However, 
the urn weighs no more than 2 lbs. and easily fits in 
the PC’s pouch for the long climb back down.
Inside the urn are black ashes—actually ten 
doses of dust of disappearance that hide an amulet of 
barkskin (once per short rest cast of barkskin requir-
ing no material components). The GM should keep 
this hidden as long as possible. The amulet remains 
invisible until all the dust is used, but begins clang-
ing in the urn as the dust level drops.
The GM may allow PCs to leap from ledge to 
ledge, but the width of the room may prohibit this.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add one vargouille. 
To decrease the challenge, remove one vargouille.

B132. THE WAY STATION
As the PCs near the entranceway to Room B132, read 
the following.
The sounds of a large group of creatures echoes 
from behind the door. Goblin-like grunts and barks 
intermingle with the yips of wolves. It sounds like 
the room is pretty active.
If the PCs enter Room B132 without making a 
Dexterity (Stealth) check, read the following.
All activities cease and the room falls silent as 
you open the door. Two dozen goblins and a few 
hobgoblins stare at you, their arms filled with 
barrels and crossbows. A group of worgs in the 
corner growl and tension mounts.
If the PCs enter Room B132 and succeed a Dexterity 
(Stealth) check, read the following.
Nearly a dozen goblins and a pair of hobgoblins 
move about the room, obviously setting up defenses 
of some kind. The goblins carry equipment that is 
too big for them and the hobgoblins yell over the 
sounds of the barking worgs.
The door to this room can be locked, but at present 
is unlocked. A successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check unlocks it without a key.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The PCs have entered a secret hideout for 
the goblin king’s soldiers. Having moved defensive 
equipment in quietly over the past few weeks, the 
excited goblins and hobgoblins are now working 
louder than they should. A perfect place to mount 
an ambush, the PCs have stumbled upon the goblin 
king’s secret plans.
There are ten goblins warriors, two hobgoblin 
guards, and three worgs in this room. The goblins 
are armed with shortswords and light crossbows, 
much different from those who trained with Ham-
merfist. The hobgoblins wear scale mail and carry 
masterwork shortbows and arrows. The worgs wear 
studded leather barding.
If the PCs have not made an alliance with the 
goblin king, Argliss, then they have a fight on 
their hands. Even if they have, the hobgoblins are 
Unfriendly, not wanting the PCs to know their 
business. A single spark is all that is needed for this 
powder keg of tension to erupt in combat.
If the PCs have allied themselves with the goblin 
king, the initial attitude of the goblins in this room 
is Indifferent. The goblins return to their business 
and ignore the PCs.
If the PCs attempt to speak with the goblins, 
they are met with short, gruff answers. As long as 
the PCs do not insult the goblins’ god, they will not 
attack the PCs.
The hobgoblins provide information regard-
ing bugbear attacks and the wild monsters in the 
region but are also gruff and barely tolerate the 
PCs. The worgs are only being held back by their 
hobgoblin handlers, and constantly growl and snap 
at the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: These goblins are zealots. They have under-
taken a long and tough (for them) pilgrimage to 
their god’s shrine. They attack the PCs in a massive 
swarm, concentrating their attacks on whoever is 
closest. The goblins will not stop attacking even 
when they are down. They jump on and gnash at 
their victim continuously until there is nothing left.
The hobgoblins fight with better tactics. They 
are armed not with short swords, but with short 
bows. The hobgoblins let the worgs loose on the 
first round of combat. The worgs dive into the PCs, 
striking randomly. The hobgoblins stay in the back 
corner of the room and unleash volleys of arrows at 
whoever they perceive to be the most powerful PCs. 
Once the target is down they concentrate their fire 
on the next most powerful, and so on.
Treasure: The barrels contain stones, whetstones, oil, 
and enough arrows, bolts, and javelins to last two 
campaigns. If the PCs need to refill their ammu-
nition, now is the time. A small pony keg contains 
ale, apparently smuggled in and a small strongbox 
(DC 24 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open) 
contains six vials of acid, six vials of alchemical fire, 
six vials of oil, and four tindertwigs.
The lead hobgoblin carries the key to the door.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add four goblins and one hobgoblin. To de-
crease the challenge, remove four goblins and one 
hobgoblin.

B133-B136 . THE SHRINE TO 
NORENDITHAS STONESHAPER  
THE QUICKTHINKING, SMITER OF FOES
What was once the final resting place of a wayward 
goblin hunter who ran afoul of a cockatrice, has 
become the true mecca for the goblin culture. The re-
moteness of their empire coupled with a location that 
is virtually on the other side of the maze, heightens 
the importance of this place; only those truly devoted 
to Norendithas Stoneshaper dare to make the trek.
The shrine is hidden behind a secret door. That a 
simple goblin passed through the door in the first 
place is astonishing, that another group of goblins 
followed the first perfectly is a true miracle. When Ar-
gliss first visited the would-be shrine, he was able to 
understand the nature of the door and gave the gob-
lin keepers of the shrine specific instructions on how 
to open and close it. It wouldn’t do if the keepers and 
so-called priests could not locate their own shrine.
The shrine is well guarded by Argliss’ elite hob-
goblins. The goblin god is the source of the doppel-
ganger’s power over the goblins, and he will not allow 
anything to jeopardize it. At any given time, the PCs 
may encounter one of the heavily armed patrols. By 
now, they should be used to the tactics of the goblins, 
and it is possible they have allied themselves with Ar-
gliss and are permitted to pay homage at the shrine.
If the PCs have allied themselves with the rebel 
goblins, the devout guards and keepers swarm the 
PCs until they are driven back or dead. The goblins do 
not tolerate heathens in their most holy of places.
B133. THE ANTECHAMBER
As the PCs near the secret door on the north wall 
read the following.
A section of the wall has been turned inward. It is 
quite obvious looking at it now that it was meant 
as a secret passage into the room beyond. Someone, 
however, has left it open. You hear strange chanting 
coming from inside the room. The high-pitched  
near wails grate on your ears as you enter.
When the PCs enter Room B133, read the following.
The goblins have hung impressive, but crude, 
tapestries along the walls. Each depicts a ferocious-
looking goblin, scowling with its hands raised above 
its head. A few goblins kneel in supplication before a 
heavy stone door set into the southern wall.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: If the PCs quietly enter the room, the 
goblins and hobgoblins do not notice them, as they 
are too involved in prayer.
Regardless of whether the PCs have made an 
alliance with the goblin king, the PCs are not wel-
come here. Three goblin warriors, unarmed, do not 
pose a threat in and of themselves, but 6d6 seconds 
after the PCs enter this room, the Hobgoblin Holy 
Guard of Stoneshaper—made up of four hobgob-
lins wielding masterwork longswords—arrive to 
drive them off.
Encounter Condition: Fearless, Hallowed 2
Tactics: If the PCs are known by the goblin empire 
as allies, they merely guide them out of the room, 
rather forcefully, but as diplomatically as possi-
ble. The goblins yell obscenities as the PCs are 
escorted out.
If the PCs are enemies of the goblins, the 
hobgoblins are outright aggressive and the goblin 
zealots grab anything they can find to use as weap-
ons. The goblins lash out, almost hysterical, while 
the hobgoblins concentrate on the PCs’ front rank, 
using brute strength to push the PCs out of the 
room, fighting them in the hall, if possible.
Treasure: The goblins consider the tapestries of their 
god priceless, though they hold no value outside 
this room. The rebel goblins might be interested 
in taking them, however, so they can defile their 
enemies’ religious icons.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two hobgoblins. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one goblin.

204
B134. THE STATUE OF NORENDITHAS STONESHAPER  
THE QUICKTHINKING, SMITER OF FOES
The room is dominated by religious iconography; 
sigils and prayer beads adorn the room. Regardless 
of what the room was originally designed for, 
the faith of the goblins has transformed it into 
something more than it was.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: PCs curious about the statue can inspect 
it. A DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check or a DC 20 
Wisdom (Survival) check reveals the statue is a 
goblin turned to stone. A second check reveals that 
either a basilisk, cockatrice, or medusa could have 
done this. PCs succeeding at a third check know 
that a medusa would leave the statue here to mark 
the boundary of its lair.
Every five minutes the PCs remain in this room, 
roll a Random Encounter, with a roll of 1-15 be-
ing Nothing and a roll of 19-20 is the Hobgoblin 
Holy Guard from Room B133 coming to secure the 
room. A 16, 17, or 18 occurs per this Section's table.
Encounter Condition: Fearless, Hallowed 5
Tactics: Hobgoblins that enter the room, do not 
hesitate and swarm the PCs. They flank the PCs in 
an attempt to subdue them and take them prisoner. 
Goblins are shaken (-1 to all rolls) for 3 turns upon 
seeing the PCs in their sacred hall.
This room contains a hidden door to Region C. 
A DC 25 Investigation check is required to locate 
the door. A special catch must be released to open 
the secret door (that slides upwards). A DC 15 Dex-
terity (Sleight of Hand) check allows the PC to slide 
their fingers into the slender crevice and open the 
secret door.
A second secret door lies beyond the first, 
requiring the same checks to find and open it. The 
secret doors close on their own after 1 minute.
Neither the goblins nor hobgoblins have located 
these doors and were unaware of a passage into 
Region C from this location. If the PCs move on 
to Region C without dealing with the holy goblin 
empire, Argliss learns of the secret door in 2d6 days 
and sends patrols into Region C, looking for a new 
route to the gnolls. 2d6 days after that, they learn of 
the cockatrice and the fate of their “god.”
Treasure: The offerings the goblins have left behind 
for their deity are in special bowls at the base of the 
statue. Burnt offerings, copper coins, and trinkets 
worthless to the PCs fill the bowls. Collectively the 
contents of the room are worth about 6 gp.

Twelve goblin pilgrims march towards the shrine. Their attitude is Hostile, as they drive the PCs from

205
B135 . THE KEEPER'S  
CLOISTER
As you enter the room you see an ornately dressed 
goblin cowering in the corner. He is wielding a 
small dagger in a shaky fist. The goblin hisses and 
sputters curses at you, spittle flying off its lips. It 
makes no move to advance or attack you, however.
The room is decorated in the same imagery as the 
antechamber and is finished simply. A small desk, 
covered in deep red stains, stands against the 
western wall. Against the southern wall is a simple 
cot, covered in rags.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The PCs have entered the personal 
quarters of the Keeper of the Shrine (5 hp goblin 
warrior). The keeper is a devout goblin, but not very 
brave. As long as the PCs do not attack him, the 
Keeper does not attack them. He curses in Goblin, 
gesturing in a vulgar manner that the PCs must 
leave the shrine. He does not speak Common.
The Hobgoblin Holy Guard (Rooms B134 and 
B136) does not enter the room unless they hear the 
sounds of combat. They have been trained not to 
disturb the Keeper’s meditation.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 1
Tactics: While he babbles he casts sanctuary to defend 
himself. If attacked the Keeper lunges at the closest 
PC. He knows he does not stand a chance against 
the PCs, but he cannot dishonor himself further 
by fleeing.
If the hobgoblins come to his rescue, they attack 
the PCs and attempt to break them off into two 
groups. They pin spellcasters and clerics into cor-
ners and fight fervently for their religious beliefs. 
If the Keeper is killed, they fight as though always 
enraged (see barbarian Rage class feature, their 
level is equal to their challenge rating).
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
B136 . BARRACKS OF  
THE HOLY GUARD
These cramped quarters house four hobgoblin 
guards who sit on the floor or on the bunks, their 
weapons at their sides. The bunks are stacked 
four high and the room reeks of sweat. Along the 
southern wall is a weapons rack, now empty.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The barracks of the Hobgoblin Holy 
Guard of the Stoneshaper is just as volatile a room 
as any located in the confines of the shrine. With 
most of the guardsmen patrolling, hobgoblin 
guards in this room do not pose a huge threat to 
the PCs. The guardsmen are relentless in their at-
tacks however hopeless their situation may seem.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: Like the other hobgoblin patrol and guard 
units, these hobgoblins single out the most pow-
erful PC and attack them en masse. They flank the 
PCs as often as possible, moving on to the next PC 
as soon as one is down. They take PC captives to the 
goblin king unless they are known enemies of the 
holy empire, in which case they are put to death.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one hobgoblin. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.

Region C . 
The Final Option
This entire region was designed specifically to hold 
a powerful demon, Falortuligo (Room C21). Though 
this cell was of primordial importance, several groups 
of minor demons and lesser undead were also held 
prisoner here. When the cataclysm that shook the 
entire dungeon struck, most of these foul minions 
escaped, but the special cell in which the mighty 
demon lord was imprisoned remained completely 
intact. Over the years, several groups of explorers and 
settlers came to the region, but the great demon’s cell 
remained undisturbed and undiscovered.
Approximately 50 years ago, the last remnants of 
the Order of Myruun (an ancient minor goddess of 
the oceans, travel, and vigilance) were summoned 
here for mysterious reasons then only known to 
Myruun. It is still possible to piece together much of 
what happened during their stay, for the remnants 
and records of the forgotten Paladins of Myruun can 
be found buried here. Most of these fragments of 
information are well hidden, but clues are scattered 
throughout the region.
Perhaps sensing the weakening of the prison wards, 
Myruun instructed her remaining worshippers and 
servants to assemble in this region of the dungeon. 
No one knew why they were brought together in the 
bowels of this forgotten place, save the fact that they 
would be instrumental in turning the tide at some 
undetermined moment. Most were paladins and 
priests of some acclaim. Only the wizard Arum ar-
rived without being summoned, claiming he dreamt 
of his “destiny” and had to come here. When the final 
pilgrim arrived, 41 men and women occupied the 
garrison established in Rooms C1-C19. It was widely 
believed by those 41 inhabitants that they were the 
last in the line of the tradition of worshiping Myruun, 
and so they waited without further explanation.
When the prison vault of Falortuligo (Room C21) 
was broken open, Myruun revealed her plans to her 
minions. With the exception of Arum, they were 
asked to give their lives to fight the powerful demon 
that had escaped. Arum’s perspective of the battle is 
recorded in only one place. It is the sole account of 
the last battle and subsequent demise of the servants 
of Myruun, as Arum was its only living witness. The 

207
207
wizard’s account can be found in Room C64 (see the 
Path of the Righteous section for further details).
It is important to note that ethereal travel is pos-
sible in the area surrounding Room C4, due to a 
powerful experiment performed by the wizard Arum 
a few months after he arrived. The boundaries of this 
ethereal pocket are roughly 100 ft. in every direction 
from the altar in Room C4 and are clearly visible if 
the subject can see objects in the ethereal plane.
C1-C19 . FORGOTTEN PALADIN GARRISON
When the knights, paladins, and priests of Myruun 
were summoned to the dungeon, they established 
a base of operation for their garrison in Rooms C1 
though C19. Evidence of their passage is obvious 
throughout the area.
Myruun (a minor goddess of the oceans, travel, and 
vigilance) had summoned her last worshippers to this 
region of the vast dungeon prison. At the time, those 
who answered the goddess’ call did not know what 
was expected of them. They lived here for more than 
three years, until one day their purpose was finally 
revealed to them, just moments before the vile de-
mon imprisoned in Room C21 broke free. To the last, 
the servants of the goddess Myruun willingly gave up 
their lives to aid an angel in destroying the demon 
called Falortuligo. None but the wizard Arum (who 
was with the devout, but was not one of them) knew 
of their sacrifice: were it not for the brave men and 
women of the Order of Myruun, the demon would 
have unleashed its wrath upon the world.

C1    . FORGOTTEN GUARDROOM
A broken cable lies amidst the crumbled and 
disheveled remains of this otherwise empty room. 
Oddly enough, this room is not saturated with the 
same dust as others in the area. It is eerily quiet 
and the walls are unwashed.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The Order of Myruun once used this 
chamber as a guard post. Aside from the rod (see 
Treasure), however, this room contains nothing of 
interest or value.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A PC who succeeds at a DC 14 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check finds a rod under the table. 
A further DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
notes that the craftsmanship on the rod is of mas-
terwork quality. Anyone making a DC 17 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check learns that this rod was transmuted 
into wood from some sort of metal. It was actually 
a rod of silence (cast a 2nd-level silence once per 
day without using a spell slot. Does not require 
attunement). Nothing short of a wish spell can 
restore it, and the rod is completely non-magical 
unless restored.

C3. ETHEREAL FILCHER'S LAIR
PCs succeeding at a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check notice the floor in front of the secret door is 
worn. The solid stone door itself is otherwise indistin-
guishable from the wall. The massive door spins on a 
vertical, central spindle so pushing the left side of the 
door, for example, causes the right side of it to swing 
outward. To open the door, characters must make a 
DC 20 Strength check while pushing on only the left 
or right side of it. The broken pieces of a spent gas 
trap are the primary reason the door is so difficult to 
open. Clearing the debris from the doorway allows 
the door to swing freely on its axis.
As the door of this chamber opens, a fetid stench 
is released. Within the darkness, tiny flecks of 
reflected light sparkle and shine. A closer look 
reveals a dark shape moving slowly, as more 
twinkling lights appear.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This is the home of a Large ethereal 
filcher. The creature arrived at the prison sometime 
after the wizard Arum’s successful experiment. It 
has gathered quite a collection of coins, gems, bau-
bles, and other shiny objects over the years. Though 
it can travel outside the ethereal pocket, its survival 
instincts prevent it from leaving for extended peri-
ods. When the PCs enter its lair, it stands quietly in 
the corner of the room in ethereal form, waiting for 
them to leave.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), 
Concealment
Tactics: Though not particularly intelligent, this crea-
ture learned to use its jaunt ability very effectively. It 
remains hidden unless attacked or angered. If the 
PCs take more than a few baubles from the room, 
its attitude changes to hostile and it charges them.
Its favorite tactic is to use its jaunt to surprise its 
opponents. Between attacks, it positions itself for 
the best chance at surprise. If combat starts for any 
reason, the filcher fights until its hit points total 
drops below half. When this happens, it jaunts to 
another room and remains there until it feels safe 
enough to return to its lair.
Treasure: Though it is impressive to see this much 
treasure displayed in such a small space, it quick-
ly becomes apparent that the total value of this 
amassed fortune is less than it appears. A DC 12 

209
209
Intelligence (Intelligence) check estimates most 
items are colored glass or quartz, which brings 
the total value of all the treasure in the room to 
about 55 gp. Under the almost worthless jewels 
and trinkets are 5 old wax candles and badly worn 
vestments.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a second ethereal filcher. To decrease the chal-
lenge, reduce the filcher’s hit points by 30.
C4 . SMALL SHRINE
The floors and walls of this room are surprisingly 
clean but the most prominent feature is a small but 
old shrine standing neglected against the eastern 
wall. This simple wooden shrine is engraved with 
an ancient symbol.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The followers of Myruun used this small 
shrine to meditate in quiet solitude. Good-aligned 
PCs feel comfortable and at ease when they enter 
this chamber. All good characters that rest for at 
least one hour in this room gain the benefit of bless 
and aid for 1 hour after they leave the shrine.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check of the shrine reveals a folded piece of 
parchment slid into a seam near the top of the altar.
The parchment starts as a standard prayer writ-
ten to the goddess Myruun. A DC 17 Intelligence 
(Religion) check allows PCs to notice ancient refer-
ences to Myruun, an old goddess of oceans, travel, 
and vigilance. PCs making this check also know that 
Myruun is no longer worshiped. Near the bottom 
of the parchment the text trails off and a few short 
sentences were hastily written. These have nothing 
to do with the rest of the parchment. The sentences 
read “She calls at last! Gladly will I lay down my life 
for my Queen! She calls to us all!”
This parchment is a fragment of the Lost Pala-
dins’ tale.
Scaling: N/A
C5 . MAIN TEMPLE
An intolerable stench escapes when the door to 
this chamber is opened, temporarily dulling the 
opulence of the high-vaulted ceilings and painted 
walls inside the room. The powerful scent is enough 
to make even the strongest dwarf blanch in disgust. 
There is a horribly decayed giant bat corpse in the 
corner that’s causing the cloying odor here. A closer 
look inside reveals that the walls of this chamber 
are painted white but are dusty and a large stone 
altar is pushed up against the southern wall.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The intricately carved doors leading into 
this room foretell the importance and prestige 
given to the temple inside. PCs outside the door 
succeeding at a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check 
hear wings flapping from within. Two giant bats 
were lured and trapped inside the room several 
months ago. Though only one is still alive, it is now 
maddened with thoughts of freedom.
PCs entering the room must make a DC 12 Con-
stitution save or become infected by Slimy Doom: 
each hour, an infected character’s skin is gradually 
covered in gooey gel.
 '
Slimy Doom. Immediately and at the end of each 
hour, an infected PC’s maximum hit points are re-
duced by 2d6. After each reduction, the infected PC 
may reattempt the saving throw, ending the disease 
on a success. Maximum hit points are restored only 
after the disease has ended and the PC completes a 
Long Rest.
PCs succeeding at a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) 
check confirm that the fallen bat died of slimy 
doom. The other dire bat is trapped here, which has 
made it angry and afraid.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The surviving giant bat immediately attacks 
anyone opening either door leading into this room 
as it pushes to escape its cell. If it surprises the PCs, 
it attempts to force its way past, flying down the 
corridor outside of the room. Otherwise it moves 
into the doorway and attacks the closest PC, doing 
everything possible to prevent being sealed inside 
the room again. At the earliest opportunity, it flies 
down the corridor away from the temple.

210
210
Treasure: There is nothing left of value in this room. 
Even the altar near the south wall is empty.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have characters who start their turn within 5 ft. 
of the dire bat make a DC 12 Constitution saving 
throw or become poisoned from the stench. The 
condition lasts until they leave the room. To de-
crease the challenge, eliminate the opportunity for 
the dire bat to surprise the PCs.
C6 . FORMER ARMORY
The door to this room is locked and trapped. PCs 
who succeed at a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check 
discover poison smeared on the locking mechanism. 
Avoiding direct skin contact with the lock is the only 
way to bypass the trap. However, the poison coating 
the lock has lost potency over the years because of 
the moisture inside the room and previous attempts 
at picking it. Any contact with the poison causes a 
painful rash on the skin, regardless of the save.
 '
Locking Mechanism Coated with Contact Poison Trap. 
Detect: DC 17 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 
16 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools); Characters making 
contact with the surface must make a DC 10 Consti-
tution save or suffer 1d4+1 poison damage.
Picking the lock under normal circumstances 
requires a DC 16 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check. Any-
one picking the lock without touching the surface, or 
while wearing gloves, has Disadvantage on the check.
This warm and musty room holds many worm 
ridden wooden racks for weapons on its walls. 
Though a few rusty swords remain, most are 
useless because the leather bindings or wooden 
shafts are decayed beyond repair over the years.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Other than a few scraps of cloth and 
wood, this room is bare. If the PCs spend 30 min-
utes in this room, roll for a Random Encounter.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs succeeding at a DC 15 Intelligence 
check notice a masterwork quality metal warham-
mer head coated with a thin wax preventing rust. All 
the other weapons are either too rusted or dam-
aged to be of any interest.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the poison damage to 2d10. To decrease 
the challenge, decrease the detection and lock pick 
DCs by -3.
C7 . FORMER ASSISTANT'S OFFICE
Though it is easy to determine this chamber 
once served as a living room, the current state 
of disrepair implies someone took great pains to 
destroy everything that was not worth escaping 
with. Dark stains splatter the walls and floors and 
broken pieces of glass, wood, and stone are piled in 
a great heap.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This was the office of the second in com-
mand of the Order of Myruun, but the place was 
sacked long ago.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs wishing to search the rubble need to 
make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
to discover a cracked floor tile, broken when the 
room’s contents were piled on the floor. Under-
neath this floor tile is a space with a small diary 
and a holy symbol of Myruun. The holy symbol is 
attached to a silver chain with a broken clasp easily 
repaired with the appropriate tools. This symbol, 
which represents a flat round earth filled with 
oceans, is worth upwards of 250 gp to historians 
and members of religious orders interested in the 
history of the old goddess Myruun and her clergy.
The diary has writing on nearly every surface of 
every page. The first page has a rather verbose title, 
“ The Diary of Thomas Corsek, Paladin of Myruun 
the Vigilant, Lady of Travel, Queen of the Oceans. 
Being a diary pertaining to personal events of life 
and service as squire to my brother, Geoff Corsek, 
and my Queen.” Next to Geoff Corsek, the words 
“The Gold General’ were written and circled, as if 
added at a much later date. Written in much small-
er text at the bottom of the page is the additional 
subtitle, “And being a record of the Calling as we 
travel to a post my Lady has given us, to turn the 
tide as my Queen instructed.”
PCs spending at least one hour reading through 
the pages of the diary find many entries character-
istic of a young man who idolizes his older brother 

211
211
yet doubts his own abilities. The diary tends to be 
vague in reference to details about locations or 
dates, but rather specific about personal goals, 
religious rituals, and specific prayers as if recording 
these rituals helped to learn them. “The Gold Gen-
eral” refers both to the narrator’s brother’s uncanny 
ability to find chests of gold lost as sea and his 
quality as a leader of men. After the first dozen en-
tries or so, there is a sentence written in a different 
style that reads, “Though I am not worthy of her 
grace, my Queen has bid me travel with Geoff to 
stand vigil under the ground.”
PCs reading the diary completely and who make 
a DC 15 Intelligence check note the total time span-
ning from the first entry written inside the garrison 
to the last entry in the diary is nearly three years. 
This is another piece of the Lost Paladins’ tale.

C8 . FORMER COMMANDER'S MEETING 
ROOM
Another collection of debris is stacked in the center 
of this room, and the eastern wall is covered in 
black soot around the remains of the charred 
husk of the door. Despite the signs of fire damage 
coming from the next room, this pile of debris is 
built with non-combustible materials like twisted 
metal, broken stone, and mortar.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The commander of the Order of Myruun 
and his subordinates once used this chamber as a 
meeting place.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 6
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: This room has a floor tile with a secret 
compartment underneath it in the same position as 
in Room C7. Anyone specifically looking there finds 
the compartment, otherwise a DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check is required to uncover it. A leather 
parchment traveling case is hidden underneath the 
tile. It contains documents, two quills, and a vial of 
dried ink.
The documents contain duty rosters and work 
assignments for 41 people, as well as various maps 
of the lands surrounding the dungeon. Most maps 
have markings denoting the lines of travel various 
individuals took to arrive at this garrison. These 
maps are all external, stopping at the entrance in 
Region A. The interior map of the garrison area is 
notably missing, although the duty rosters clearly 
refer to it.
Scaling: N/A
C9 . FORMER COMMANDER'S CHAMBER
The door of this room is a heavily damaged frame 
that hangs upon a solitary remaining hinge. The 
area was clearly incinerated completely some time 
in the past. The chamber itself is blackened with 
soot covering the entire floor, walls, and ceiling. The 
pile of ash in the center of the room shows where 
an enormous fire blazed, long ago.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was the leader of the Order 
of Myruun’s private abode. But now, an athach (a 
3-armed, green-skinned giant) named Nurganar 
makes his home here. He moves back and forth 
throughout the region, so there is only a 25% 
chance of finding him here at any one time. If the 
PCs encountered (and killed) Nurganar as a random 
encounter, he is not here. If he is here, he is count-
ing his coins or organizing his belongings.
This chamber has a floor tile with a secret compart-
ment underneath it in the same position as in 
Rooms C7 and C8. Anyone specifically looking there 
finds the compartment, otherwise a successful DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to uncov-
er it. Nurganar keeps his treasure under the floor 
tile (thinking it safe there).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If battle ensues in his lair, Nurganar posi-
tions himself to defend his treasure. Though most 
of what he owns is worthless, he believes the shiny 
objects he collects are extremely valuable, so he 
avidly defends his treasure. Given the opportunity, 
he targets the physically strongest PC first, concen-
trating all his attacks on this one foe.
If reduced to 25% or less of his total hit points, 
Nurganar begs for his life, offering the PCs his 
treasure in exchange for their mercy. He does not 
ask twice, though and fights viciously if they mock 
or betray his good nature.

212
212
Treasure: Nurganar loves to collect all manner of 
shiny objects. Under a thick fur rug (worth 20 gp) 
in the corner of the room is a multitude of colored 
glass shards, glistening rocks, and a handful of 
semi-precious gemstones. Though the five gems 
are worth 10 gp each, the other items are honestly 
worthless to all but the athach.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, give Nurganar Sneak Attack (3d6 damage) and 
have him wait in Ambush (darkness). To decrease 
the challenge, have him return from a long jaunt, 
fatigued, with halved movement speed and Disad-
vantage on attack rolls.
C10 . FAKE DOOR
Written in Common on the surface of this 
otherwise normal door are the words, “WARNING! 
DO NOT ENTER! DANGER!” The letters are 
written in burgundy paint.
The moment the door is touched, a ghostly outline of 
a wild-haired old woman floats through the middle of 
the doorway.
The red lettering of warnings remains visible 
behind the translucent body as the creature moans, 
“This is now your second warning. You will not 
receive a third. Stay out of this room.” Even as the 
form is speaking the last few words, it sinks back 
into the door and disappears entirely.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The door was designed to fool creatures 
venturing into the dungeon. It leads to a solid wall.
The ghost is a programmed illusion that resets 
after 5 minutes. Anyone ignoring the warning and 
entering the room must succeed at a DC 25 Dexter-
ity check to unlock the door. The door handle is on 
the left side of the door, which opens outward. The 
wall behind it is painted completely black to height-
en the illusion of a dark and forbidding room, but it 
is nevertheless made of solid rock.

C11 . FORMER STORE
This small chamber is empty. A thick blanket of 
dust covers its floor, suggesting that no one set foot 
in this area in a long time.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The members of the Order of Myruun 
once used this room to store goods, but it is now 
empty. The lock on the door to this room is of par-
ticularly high quality. It was added by a locksmith 
servant of Myruun when the deity’s last followers 
were called to this region of the dungeon. Unlike 
most other locks in the region, it is made of silvery 
iron. The mechanism, in fact, looks brand new. Any-
one attempting to pick the door must make a DC 
20 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Most of the goods stored in this chamber 
were brought to Rooms C8 and C9 where they were 
put to flame, as the Paladins of Myruun knew they 
were all going to die and did not want these items 
to fall in the hands of evil creatures. However, small 
piles of broken glass collect dust in the corner of 
the rooms. In addition to the glass, there are 13 
stone arrowheads and a small piece of smooth 
volcanic glass with the symbol of Myruun etched 
on one side. PCs who succeed at DC 15 Intelligence 
checks recognize the volcanic glass curio used to 
have a pendant and be worth as much as 50 gp if it 
were fashioned into another piece of jewelry.

Several thick woolen blankets are lined upon the

C13 . FORMER COMMON ROOM
A DC 27 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the secret 
door on the south wall. It is extremely difficult to find, 
mostly because it hasn’t been opened in hundreds of 
years. Anyone finding the secret door needs to make 
a DC 25 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to determine 
how to unlock it. The locking mechanism is simple 
but must be triggered each time the door is opened, 
but no special tools are required. Anyone succeeding 
at a DC 12 Dexterity check can open the hidden portal 
once they understand how to manipulate the device. 
No check is required to open the doors from inside 
the secret passageway.
This room has two doorways in the northeast 
corner. The door to the north has been torn off 
its hinges and removed from the frame while the 
one to the east is barred. There are hooks in the 
southern and northern walls at various points, 
indicating that large tapestries or paintings were 
once displayed there. In the center of the hall, 
metal fastenings are attached to the floor, as 
if a dining table had once been affixed here as 
well. Two broken chairs are tossed casually in the 
southwestern corner.

C14 . LARGE MEETING ROOM
PCs making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, or a 
DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discover that 
both stone doors are heavily detailed. The creators of 
the doors even added stone rivets and a simulated 
locking mechanism, nearly identical to other doors 
found throughout the dungeon. Even the stone bars 
fastened across the eastern door have a peculiar 
wooden grain to them. PCs succeeding at a DC 17 
Intelligence (Arcana) check realize the doors were 
changed into stone, underscoring the extraordinary 
measures taken to keep something from getting out 
of the next room.
Anyone attempting to open the eastern door must 
first lift the 600 Ib. stone bars from their slots. The 
top bar is set 4 ft. from the floor and the lower bar 
rests 2 ft. below the first. Once the bars are laid to the 
side, the door still requires a DC 18 Strength check to 
pull open.
The heavy stone door leading into this room 
scrapes along the floor until it gets stuck after 
three feet. The room’s interior is more barren than 
normal. Stains and scuff marks are visible along 
the ground and walls though someone wiped the 
dirt and dust clean. Another large stone door is 
found on the east wall, locked with two heavy 
stone bars.

C15 . FORMER BARRACKS
There are three more doorways leading out of this 
room, but the doors and frames are gone. The 
openings lead to other chambers, which appear 
to be the same size as the main room. Oozing 
through the doorway of the easternmost chamber 
is a glob of black goo. It is impossible to determine 
how vast it is because it completely covers the 
doorway as it slowly squeezes into the main room.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: About 20 years ago, Arum the Wizard 
trapped a black pudding inside this room after 
narrowly escaping its grasp. Guptu the Pale, an 
ogre mage who was a thorn in Arum’s side for years 
after the paladin’s last battle, had set an ambush for 
Arum with the pudding. Guptu and Arum faced off 
many times before the ogre mage was killed, but 
this pudding was his most deadly trap.

214
214
To contain the black pudding, Arum polymor-
phed the iron door and wooden bars into stone, 
hoping to seal the creature inside. He knew the 
pudding would continue to grow until it devoured 
everything in the barracks, but he also knew it 
would never escape on its own. In the event some-
one did manage to set it free, he cleaned the 
meeting room of everything the pudding could 
consume and sealed this chamber with another 
stone door.
The pudding is now so big that it fills whichev-
er room it occupies in the former barracks. It has 
consumed everything inside the chamber, includ-
ing the missing doors and hinges. But because it 
must force its way through the small doorways to 
move from room to room, it is slower than normal. 
It has a speed of 5-ft. and a 10-ft. reach. However, 
any pieces splitting from the host body move and 
attack normally.
PCs succeeding at DC 20 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) checks hear the odd sound of the pudding’s 
motion, like a gelatinous liquid piling up, or a slow 
scraping waterfall. The sound is coming from the 
central eastern cubicles.
Encounter Condition: Cursed 4
Tactics: By the time the PCs find the black pudding, it 
has already sensed the PCs and is moving to attack. 
It moves directly toward the closest PC, switching 
direction if the PCs run to another room. The pud-
ding cannot split itself on its own and only attacks 
in one direction at a time.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the speed and reach of the pudding by 10 
ft. and 5 ft. respectively. To decrease the challenge, 
reduce the black pudding’s hit points by 60.
C16 . COCKATRICE MAZE
The walls here are worn. Corridors turn sharply 
at random intervals or end abruptly. In addition, 
sound seems to soak right into the walls, muffling 
footsteps and speech.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: There are signs that someone attempted 
to dig further into the rock and stone near several 
of the dead-end passages. No tools can be found, 
but there are piles of dirt and gravel in the area.
About six years ago, a goblin from Region B got sepa-
rated from his raiding party and stumbled upon the 
secret door leading west. After going through the 
room, he found the cockatrice’s lair, was bitten, and 
turned to stone. The cockatrice entered the secret 
passage to ward off any other trespassers, but the 
door closed behind it. Since then, the cockatrice has 
wandered throughout the maze trying to find its 
way back to its lair.
Many wanderers have found their way into the 
maze since then, only to be turned to stone by the 
crazed beast that attacks everything coming across 
its path (see Room C19 for more cockatrice victims). 
The PCs should stumble upon the cockatrice when 
rounding a corner, as the cockatrice is most often 
found wandering this region.
Encounter Condition: Ambush
Tactics: When encountered, the cockatrice attacks, 
turning weaker PCs to stone. If wounded, it flees to 
Room C19, unless it is cornered. If given no chance 

215
215
to escape, it fiercely attacks the closest PC, until it 
has a chance to flee. The gargoyle in Room C19 has 
helped it fight off attackers in the past.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
allow the cockatrice to surprise the PCs or attack 
from darkness. To decrease the challenge, have 
the cockatrice flee to Room C19 at the sound of 
footsteps.
C17 . FORMER GUARD POST
The moment the door latch is turned, it swings 
inward as a giant guillotine-like pendulum attached 
to the ceiling descends. Inside, along the north wall, 
there are six nail holes some six feet off the ground. 
Resting on its side in the southeastern corner is an 
old wooden chair with three legs.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: PCs who make a DC 13 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check notice that the door is unlocked, 
but that there is constant tension upon it. Anyone 
making a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
discovers there is no way to bypass or disarm this 
trap but realizes that it can be triggered at a safe 
distance. The trap was poorly designed, as the pen-
dulum is fastened to the ceiling directly above the 
doorway. This causes it to slam against the frame, 
stopping its progress at the bottom of its arc of 
motion. The trap can only hit someone standing 
directly in front of the door.
 '
Ceiling Pendulum Trap. Detect: DC 15 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools); A 
character standing in front of the bladed pendulum 
must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or take 3d12 + 8 
slashing damage.
A DC 27 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the 
secret door on the north wall. This door is extreme-
ly difficult to find because it has not been opened 
in centuries. Anyone finding the secret door needs 
to make a DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check 
to determine how to unlock it. The locking mech-
anism must be triggered each time the door is 
opened, but no special tools are required. Anyone 
making a DC 10 Dexterity check can open the hid-
den portal once they understand how to manipulate 
the opening device. No check is required to open 
the door from inside the secret passageway.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Except for the broken chair, trap, and the 
secret passageway, this room holds nothing else 
of interest.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the trap to 5d12 + 8. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the damage dealt by 
the trap to 3d8.
C18 . FORMER SPARRING ROOM
Two great stone chairs face each other across this 
wide room, as if waiting for opposing generals to 
sit and watch their champions compete. The chair 
to the west resembles a sailing vessel, the back 
support being a large mast with two cross beams 
and the armrests tapering into the semblance of 
a prow. The chair to the east is shaped to look like 
a tsunami, curled back upon itself and preparing 
to douse whoever sits in its path. Both chairs are 
about 10 ft. in front of their respective walls.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This was the Paladins’ exercise room, 
as well as a place to hold contests for sport, and 
settling disputes. PCs who make DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check notice a faint 20-ft.-wide square 
painted on the ground in the center of the room. 
They also see the ground near the western chair is 
scraped and marred, as if the chair had been moved 
and left slightly askew.
The western chair releases a cloud of insanity 
mist if it is moved in any direction. Anyone stand-
ing between a 10 ft. radius to a 20 ft. radius from 
the chair is allowed a DC 15 Dexterity save to jump 
outside the poisonous cloud and avoid its effect, 
but anyone closer is automatically caught in the 
mist. This trap cannot be bypassed, but it is only ac-
tivated when the chair is moved. The eastern chair 
is not trapped.
Insanity Mist Vapor Trap. Detect: DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception); Disable: DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ 
Tools); Characters in a 10-ft.-square area suffer 
confusion for 3 rounds.

Anyone succeeding at a DC 13 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check values the chairs at well 
over 1,000 gp each, because of the unique 
craftsmanship.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
inflict a short-term madness on each character hit 
with the insanity mist. To decrease the challenge, 
allow each character caught by the mist a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw to negate the effects.
C19 . LARGE MURAL ROOM
Both doors to this room are open.
The rows of goblin and gnoll statues arranged 
in this room contrast with most of the stark and 
empty rooms found so far. There are also several 
murals painted on the walls, looking as clean and 
bright as the day they were painted. The art on 
the north wall shows a knight in shining golden 
armor, standing at the prow of a ship and looking 
out at an endless ocean. The west wall depicts a 
battle between a battered ship and a coiled sea 
serpent, as a bolt of lightning comes down from 
the sky to strike the serpent. The east wall shows a 
breathtaking picture of a beautiful woman looking 
out over a calm sea at sunset, as if awaiting the 
return of her beloved.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The murals painted on the walls are mag-
ically protected, so it is impossible to erase them or 
dilute their colors. If the PCs study the murals, they 
notice titles written in Common painted at the bot-
toms of the pictures. The western mural is entitled 
“The Oceans,” the northern is called “The Journey,” 
and the eastern is simply labeled “Vigilance.” In 
addition to the titles, further inspection reveals the 
incredible detail in each mural. It is clear to every-
one that these paintings would be priceless if they 
had been painted on a portable canvas.
The statues in the room are arranged into four 
rows. There are seven gnoll, seven goblin, and three 
human statues in addition to the gargoyle that 
haunts the place. None of the statues in the room 
are on bases except for the gargoyle standing on 
a square stone block in the second row from the 
west. Anyone examining the statues can make a DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check to realize the gar-
goyle is alive. The three human statues are in the 
second row from the east. The statue at the north 
end of the row is of a man dressed in hides who 
just finished a powerful, two-handed swing with 
his warhammer. The second statue from the south 
is of a woman in studded leather armor with an 
empty bow, reaching behind her back for another 
arrow. The last statue in that row shows a small, 
wiry man in leather armor standing on one leg, 
as if dodging something. All the goblin and gnoll 
statues have similar poses, but most of them show 
horrified faces.
Anyone making a DC 14 Intelligence (Investi-
gation) check while studying the statues discovers 
hairline cracks and chips in all of them. In addition, 
several of them have heads that were broken off 
and placed back upon the neck. All the statues were 
once humanoids petrified by the cockatrice before 
being dragged here by the gargoyle. None of them 
would survive the transformation back to flesh.
This room is the home of a gargoyle, but the 
creature does not move until discovered or com-
bat begins with the PCs. Unless the PCs killed the 
cockatrice in Room C16, it is also hiding here. Allow 
a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to see the cock-
atrice as it moves away from them, trying to hide 
behind the statues.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Conceal-
ment, Echoes 4
Tactics: The gargoyle attacks if it is discovered, if the 
cockatrice enters combat, or if a PC turns his back 
on it while within close range. In any of these cir-
cumstances, the gargoyle attempts to gain surprise 
on the closest PC. If none are within range, it ma-
neuvers to attack unarmored opponents first. The 
gargoyle performs a full attack whenever possible. 
If present, the cockatrice avoids the PCs and does 
not attack unless it is cornered or they attack the 
gargoyle. If the gargoyle is destroyed, or it has less 
than 10 hit points remaining, the cockatrice flees 
back to Room C16.
Treasure: Except for the murals, which cannot be 
removed, the room is empty.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add an additional damage die to each of the 
gargoyle’s attacks. To decrease the challenge, the 

217
217
gargoyle begins the encounter wounded 
(-40 hit points).
C20-C21 . PATH OF 
DESTRUCTION
The demon imprisoned in room C21 has 
many names. His true name is still unknown, 
and this is perhaps the main reason he has 
been so consistently elusive. He is most often 
referred to as Falortuligo, which translates 
into Common as “the clever ash,” or “Ash, the 
Trickster.” In addition to his ability to escape impris-
onment of any kind, Ash is renowned for being a 
malicious tormentor.
That reputation was the primary reason he earned 
a special place in this prison. His cell was designed 
with no exit and its entrance is a specially constructed 
gateway, set inside two archways to create a one-way 
portal into the cell. The cell was flooded with water 
and eight massive cold iron chains were designed to 
seek and clamp down on any heat source entering 
the place. When the chains found purchase on the 
demon that was transported here, the runes on the 
walls of the cell activated and froze everything solid.
Ash was discovered by a group of angels and 
captured. He was then transported to the cell’s entry 
chamber after construction was completed (room 
C110). The demon offered little resistance until the 
last moment, when he pushed a solar angel named 
Amarantiel into the prison portal. Right before he 
was forced inside himself, Amarantiel (which means 
“Unfading Vigilance” in the Celestial tongue) knew 
there would be no escape from the cell. He accepted 
his imprisonment, fighting to subdue Ash in order 
to hasten the freezing process. Though unable to 
prevent one chain from attaching itself to his body, 
Amarantiel directed the other seven chains to Ash. 
The magical walls then froze them both in solid ice 
for millennia.
If Amarantiel thought his unjust interment would 
be spent in quiet contemplation, he was quickly 
corrected by Ash. From the first hour of their con-
finement, Falortuligo initiated a telepathic dialog 
with Amarantiel. Over the centuries, Ash embedded 
thoughts and voices into Amarantiel’s mind, convinc-
ing him that the angel had been falsely imprisoned. 
During the last hundred years of their imprisonment, 
the demon twisted his soothing words until Amaran-
tiel believed Ash was another solar angel.
The final key to unlocking Ash’s prison came when 
the wizard Arum arrived. A decade or so ago, Arum 
built a laboratory (in room C20) and Ash took the 
opportunity to speak telepathically with the wizard. 
Arum believed Ash was a falsely imprisoned angel, 
caught when the demon Falortuligo was placed in his 
cell within the prison complex. The demon told Arum 
it was impossible for him to gain freedom with-
out also setting the demon free. Arum was warned 
against telling anyone they had spoken, to prevent 
the possibility of someone freeing the angel, because 
it would also release the demon. Ash’s steadfast re-
fusal of all offers of assistance, lest the demon be set 
free, convinced Arum that the voice in his head was 
that of the angel Amarantiel.
Posing as Amarantiel, Ash asked nothing of the wiz-
ard, but occasionally conversed with Arum during his 
studies. These conversations became more frequent 
as Arum asked “Ash” for advice on magical theories 
and practices while working in his lab. It was during 
one such discussion about the creation of magical 
weaponry that Ash set in motion a plan that would 
lead to his inevitable release.
Arum complained about spending too much time 
maintaining his forge to generate sufficient heat, 
and that his research was suffering as a result. Ash 
suggested placing wards on the front of the forge to 
reflect the heat back into the walls. A higher level of 
heat would then be maintained. Not coincidentally, 
this would also focus a great amount of heat on the 
stone wall surrounding the prison. Arum, however, 
did not know how close he was to Ash‘s icy prison cell. 

218
218
It was this mixture of intense cold from the prison 
and constant heat from the forge that eventually 
cracked the wall separating Rooms C20 and C21 and 
melted the ice to water, which boiled away into the 
forge. Once the wall was weakened, Falortuligo and 
Amarantiel broke free.
When they broke through the wall of the prison, 
the members of the Order of Merunda confronted 
them. At first, Amarantiel believed Ash was another 
angel, and he did not understand why the Paladins of 
Merunda fought him. For millennia, the demon de-
ceived Amarantiel, who now believed Ash was his kin.
While the brave followers of Merunda fought the 
demon, Arum used several illusions to trick Amaran-
tiel into activating his true sight. It was then that the 
veil was lifted from the angel’s eyes and he under-
stood the nature of Ash’s treachery. The Paladins of 
Merunda gave their lives to allow Amarantiel to see 
through the demon’s lies. Their sacrifice allowed the 
angel to regain his senses and slay the demon.
The events leading up to the final confrontation 
between the demon and Amarantiel is recorded in 
Arum’s account of the battle in Room C64.
This Section has no random encounters.
C20 . ARUM'S FORMER LABORATORY
Piles of rubble and cracked stone blocks along the 
walls take up most of the floor of this chamber. 
Inside the room, an immense mound of debris is 
splayed out upon the ground in front of a gaping 
hole in the eastern wall. The rest of the chamber 
is a jumble of crushed timber and broken glass 
strewn about the larger pieces of stone. The west 
wall is scorched, especially around the entrance to 
the room where an overturned forge lays cold and 
broken against the wall.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is the former laboratory and 
living quarters of the wizard Arum. Judging by the 
ground and dispersal pattern of the explosion, 
the hole in the eastern wall is where the forge 
was located before the wall broke. There is a faint 
residue of abjuration magic coming from the 
crushed forge. If PCs examine the forge closer, they 
can attempt a DC 23 Intelligence (Arcana) check to 
decipher the magical runes written inside as wards 
that reflect the heat and energy of the forge back 
into itself.
PCs succeeding at DC 19 Wisdom (Perception) 
checks find several books wedged under the mass 
of stones and boulders. It is clear the books are 
damaged, but they may be of some use, if the 
PCs can find a way to move the massive blocks to 
retrieve them. Most of the blocks of stone in the 
room weigh more than 500 lbs. each, and many 
smaller boulders must be removed before the larg-
er ones can be pushed aside. Anyone attempting 
to clear the rubble must make three separate DC 
17 Strength checks. For each Strength check made, 
one book can be recovered. No more than one 
Strength check can be made every 15 minutes. PCs 
failing to rest after each check suffer cumulative 
points of Exhaustion every half hour.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There is no treasure here unless the PCs 
remove at least three of the undamaged books from 
under the stones. Anyone proficient with Intelli-
gence (Arcana) gains a permanent +2 with the skill 
after spending one month reading the fragments 
of these three books. No further advantages are 
gained for reading more books, but a total of seven 
can be recovered.
Scaling: N/A
C21 . BROKEN PRISON OF FALORTULIGO
This enormous, one hundred ft. tall room is 
noticeably colder than other rooms in the area. 
Four massive chains hang like pillars from the 
ceiling at even intervals in the center of the 
chamber. Coiled upon the ground amid the last 
few links hanging from the ceiling are four more 
impossibly huge chains. The shackles at the end of 
each chain are twisted and warped, as if something 
of immense strength broke its way free. The rest 
of the vast room is surprisingly empty, save for 
the large blue runes encircling the chamber and 
an ornate archway on the north wall. The runes 
emit a faint, steady, and oscillating glow, as if 
imitating the breathing patterns of an enormous 
sleeping beast.
Initial Attitude: Friendly

219
219
Encounter: PCs succeeding at a DC 17 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check realize the chains have prop-
erties of cold iron and adamantine. The PCs who 
make such checks also know it should not be 
possible to combine those two metals, since one is 
forged at low temperature and the other at ex-
tremely high temperatures.
The ornate archway on the north wall has intri-
cate designs surrounding a curtain-like interior. 
The surface of the archway is solid, but has a fluid 
sensation to it. There is no way to pass through the 
archway from this side.
A few minutes after the PCs enter the room, 
Zrino (a lantern archon) arrives through the arch-
way from Room C110. PCs succeeding at a DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check see the creature pass 
through the magical entrance. The archon gives 
the PCs information regarding the prison and its 
current state , as well as providing background 
information about this room (including what little it 
knows about its former occupants).
Zrino’s primary task is to inform the PCs that a 
special key (in Room C105) lends access to anoth-
er door in the dungeon. The archon describes the 
key and indicates it lies to the southeast, but to get 
there, the PCs need to deal with danger along the 
way. The PCs also need the Mark of the Righteous, 
for only those who are blessed with this mark can 
open the door leading into the room where the 
key lies. The archon is able and willing to give the 
mark to those who want it, except for evil-aligned 
characters.
The Mark of the Righteous endows a permanent 
+1 bonus on all saving throws for good characters. 
Neutral characters are unaffected by its effect. If a 
character with the mark ever becomes evil, he loses 
the bonus and suffers a -2 luck penalty on all saving 
throws for as long as they remain evil or until the 
mark dissipates. The archon Zrino gives the mark 
by shining a light on the palm of any non-evil char-
acter wishing to receive it. Close examination of 
a marked hand shows a faintly glowing sigil upon 
the palm. A DC 25 Intelligence (Religion) check 
reveals this sigil as an ancient symbol denoting 
righteousness or proven goodness. The mark lasts 
for 1d3+1 months, after which time it disappears 
from the character’s palm entirely. The Mark of the 
Righteous also grants the bearer the ability to read 
and understand Celestial, but not speak it.
If the PCs ask for aid, the archon replies in a 
musical voice, “I can give you light for your eyes 
and illumination for your mind, but our paths do 
not cross.” Zrino casts continual flame (up to twice 
per PC) on any item the PCs want enchanted. Aside 
from the information regarding the prison and the 
special key, he knows little about the inhabitants 
of the region or the current state of affairs in any 
region other than C and G.
If questioned about Arum, Zrino simply says, 
“The wizard is long gone.” Zrino is one of the 
few inhabitants of the region who knows this. If 
asked about a cure for petrification, the archon 
states, “Gahrr’k has what you seek, but does not 
help others.”
Encounter Condition: [Fear 15], Fearless, Hallowed 3, 
Positive Energy
Tactics: If anyone attacks Zrino, he activates Aura 
of Menace and then flies out of range. If the PCs 
pursue, he attacks with a scorching ray each round 
after the first. Since Zrino cannot be fully killed 
(returning in one month‘s time due to the magic of 
the dungeon), he fights to the death.
In the event the PCs halt their attack, a DC 20 
Charisma (Persuasion) check convinces the archon 
to cease fighting as well. Evil PCs receive Disadvan-
tage to that check.
Treasure: PCs searching the room for at least 1 hour 
are allowed a DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check to 
find a single loose stone in the floor. The stone is 
protected by a glyph of warding (Explosive Runes) 
and a lock that requires a DC 27 Dexterity (Thieves’ 
Tools) check. If opened, the stone can be lifted up. 
Under the tile is a long strongbox, large enough to 
store a longsword. The strongbox has another glyph 
of warding (Explosive Runes) on it and requires a DC 
27 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to open it. Both 
the tiles and the box are indestructible. Inside the 
box is a magical +3 longsword.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two lantern archons. To decrease the challenge, 
remove the Fearless Condition.

C22-C28 . NEUTRAL ZONE .
Originally, the section comprising Rooms C22-C28 
was a processing station for the smaller prison cells 
to the east and west. When an enormous earthquake 
tore a jagged chasm into the foundation of the dun-
geon prison hundreds of years ago, this region was 
all but abandoned.
For the last ten years, the rooms in this section 
were claimed by different inhabitants, including gob-
lins (from Region B) and gnolls from the Gnashing 
Fang Tribe (Rooms C29-C42). Before then, it was 
patrolled and monitored by the Paladins of Merun-
da, though they lived elsewhere in the region. To-
day, however, the section is primarily a buffer zone 
between the goblin and gnoll factions.
The rooms in this area are spattered with long-
dried blood and gore, showing signs of many battles. 
Though the halls are much cleaner than the rooms, 
most doors have crude markings upon them.

2d8+8 goblins from Region B and four gnolls from the Gnashing Fang Tribe are engaged in 
combat. The sound of battle is abrupt and loud enough to wake sleeping PCs. Another 2d6 gnolls 
arrive to support the battle 1d4 rounds after the PCs are made aware of it. The goblins sound a 
retreat if the PCs join the fight. The gnolls attack the PCs, regardless of their actions or intent. If 
the PCs do not interfere, the goblins lose half their forces and retreat, while the gnolls suffer 1d3 
casualties and carry off all dead gnolls and goblins back to their territory.

The PCs stumble upon a trap. Two sword blades strike from each side of the room when a PC steps 
on a 10-ft. square pressure plate. The blades are 3 ft. long and 4 ft. from the ground. They alternate 
directions after each attack, automatically resetting 1 round later.
Double Blade Trap. Detect: DC 15 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 16 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools); 
Characters in a 10-ft. square area DC 15 Dexterity save or take 1d6+8 piercing damage each.
19
The PCs stumble upon a trap. An audible alarm goes off, followed by confusion, affecting everyone 
within a 15-ft radius. The alarm can be heard by everyone within 120 ft. Immediately roll for a second 
encounter, ignoring results of 17, 18, and 19.
Confusion Trap. Detect: DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana); Disable: DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters 
in a 10-ft. square area DC 16 Wisdom save or suffer from confusion.

Whether these marks are warnings, territorial 
boundaries, or something else does not seem to mat-
ter, as they have been crossed out and written over 
countless times. These marks extend to some of the 
walls in the area, but are primarily focused upon the 
doors and archways.
C22 . GREASE TRAP
There are two words written on the door. One is a 
small Goblin marking and the other is a large rune 
written in Gnoll. Both say “TRAP.”
The walls of this room are black, but the floor is 
covered in a greasy residue that has an unpleasant 
smell. There is a small, black, unmoving shape lying 
near the opposite corner of the chamber. The dark 
color of the walls and floor makes it difficult to pick 
out any other features in the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: After the door is opened, the trap trig-
gers. There is a 1d6-round delay, before burning 
hands is cast from the corner nearest the door, 
directly towards the floor. Anyone standing in the 
doorway is hit and must succeed at a DC 14 Dex-
terity save for half damage or suffer 3d6 fire dam-
age. In addition, the trap simultaneously lights the 
grease on fire, causing 1d6 points of fire damage 
per round to anyone caught inside the room. The 
grease fire burns itself out in 10 rounds and the 
trap resets itself after another 10 rounds.
Burning Hands and Grease Trap. Detect: DC 19 
Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 17 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools)
Anyone searching the room, before or after it is 
set on fire, must make a DC 10 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check to notice that the walls are heavily caked 
soot. PCs succeeding at a DC 13 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check also find charred bits of bone and metal 
about the floor.
Encounter Condition: [Smoke]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add lightning bolt to the trap, 1d10 rounds into the 
fire. To decrease the challenge, remove the grease.
C23 . KILLER TRAP
The stench of decaying flesh lingers here. The 
nauseating odor is almost certainly caused by the 
rotting gnoll and goblin corpses lying upon the 
floor. They appear to have no wounds on them, but 
the look of terror on their faces is a testament to 
the violent nature of their deaths.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A phantasmal killer trap is set in this room 
that affects the first person entering it. Anyone wit-
nessing the spell sees only a vague shadowy shape. 
This trap resets itself one minute after being trig-
gered, but is only sprung again when PCs re-enter 
the room. PCs already in the room do not trigger 
the spell again.
Phantasmal Killer Trap. Detect: DC 25 Intelli-
gence (Arcana); Disable: DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Characters entering room must succeed on a DC 16 
Wisdom save or suffer from phantasmal killer.
Encounter Condition: [Smoke]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs searching the bodies find various per-
sonal effects.
The gnoll has four knucklebones used for gaming in 
a belt pouch, but one has slightly different mark-
ings. Anyone finding the bones can make DC 15 
Intelligence (Arcana) check to identify the odd bone 
as an archaic (but functional) thunderstone (thrown 
against a hard surface it casts thunderwave at 3rd 
level. Destroyed upon use). Amidst the remains of 
the two goblins the PCs find a short sword, a rusted 
dagger, and 1d4 cp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a burning hands to the phantasmal killer trap. To 
decrease the challenge, replace the phantasmal killer 
trap with a magic missile trap.

C24 . DEAD GHOUL ROOM
This door seems normal at first, but it’s locking 
mechanism is partially melted. The hinges of the 
door seem intact, if a bit rusted. Were it not for the 
mangled lock, this door would not be worth noting.
There is a desiccated corpse in the middle of the 
room. It is so skeletal and unnatural that it must 
be an undead creature. It was leaning against 
the door, as if trying to claw its way out, but it 
is no longer moving. The only thing remarkable 
about the corpse is the fascinating silver necklace 
around its neck.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These are the remains of a ghoul trapped 
here by the wizard Arum. It is still alive, although 
the necklace is constantly draining its strength. 
Thus, the ghoul remains helpless even if the 
necklace is removed, as it has been trapped here 
for years.
Encounter Condition: Haunted, Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The necklace is a simple silver medallion 
with the word “sloth” written in Elven. It is cursed 
and affects any creature with a Strength score that 
wears it. Every day it’s worn, the necklace deals 1d4 
points of Strength damage (at midnight). If this 
reduces the character to 0 Strength, the character 
dies. The strength loss is permanent for as long 
as the necklace is worn, and it cannot be removed 
by any means save remove curse. A restoration spell 
restores all lost Strength provided the necklace has 
been removed. Without the aid of magic, Strength 
lost this way returns at a rate of 1 per day once the 
item has been removed from its victim.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the necklace deal 1d6 points of Strength 
damage. To decrease the challenge, allow the victim 
to attempt a DC 18 Charisma saving throw each 
morning, removing the necklace on a success.
C25 . OPEN HALLWAY
The hallway opens into a small chamber before 
continuing to the east. There is a dark red stain 
smeared on the floor, as if something were dragged 
down the eastern corridor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The red stain is a trail of smeared blood 
leading to Room C28.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 2

C26 . SMALL CLOSET
The door to this small room squeaks open. 
Inside is a goblin. The creature is dressed in dirty 
clothes and sobs.
Initial Attitude: Neutral
Encounter: The goblin’s name is Ratul, which means 
“stupid weakling.” He was a scout for the Goblin 
King (Room B5), but never provided satisfactory 
information. In truth, Ratul is an exceptional scout. 
But he’s timid and less evil than his kin and there-
fore unwilling to help the Goblin King in his quests.
Ratul continually pulls up a glorified rag that skirts 
his waist. He is covered in cuts and scars consistent 
with the lashes of a whip. Ratul is too shocked to 
speak at first, but he’s ultimately relieved to meet 
someone who isn’t a gnoll or goblin.
If the PCs question him, Ratul pleads for mercy, 
offering his services as guide and scout. Anyone 
who makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check sens-
es Ratul’s sincerity. If the PCs threaten him, Ratul 
becomes afraid and unresponsive once more. If the 
PCs attack, he offers no defense. Ratul is familiar 
with the layout of Rooms C19-C31 and will not 
willingly travel west into Region B, east past Room 
C29, or into Room C32. Unless the PCs succeed at 
a DC 25 Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Per-
suasion) check, nothing convinces him to travel 
to those rooms. If the PCs treat him as a captive, 
or force him to go where he doesn’t want, Ratul 
escapes the first chance he gets.

223
223
If the PCs talk to him, Ratul gives out any 
information he has about the area. He describes a 
great “army of dogmen” to the east, and their war 
with the Goblin King to the west. He also knows 
the “dog king,” named Gahrr’k, has “a small jar 
of grease that makes statues come to life.” Ratul 
witnessed Gahrr’k using the stone salve on one of 
his lieutenants in Room C19, but he never saw the 
cockatrice or gargoyle. Finally, Ratul knows that the 
gnolls and goblin armies avoid this area because of 
the ghouls in Rooms C27 and C28. He chose this 
region as a hiding place because he does not be-
lieve anyone else knows the ghouls were destroyed.
If Ratul joins the PCs, he refuses to assist in 
combat. In fact, the person who is most kind to 
Ratul suffers a -2 AC penalty in any combat situ-
ation, as the goblin clings to that character’s leg 
while in battle. Ratul, however, remains true to his 
word as long as the PCs do not betray him or leave 
him unprotected.

C27 . GHASTLY MURAL
Aggravation emanates from crude drawings on 
the walls here. The images are barely recognizable, 
as the paint used to draw them has faded over 
time. In the southeastern wall of the chamber 
is a tiny structure built from gnawed bones. The 
roof of this miniature house is incomplete, but is 
otherwise surprisingly detailed. Along the eastern 
wall, nine white carved figurines are lined up next 
to the house.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Anyone studying the paintings upon the 
wall is eventually able to discern terrible pictures 
of horrifying acts of violence. Each PC studying 
the murals imagines they see something differ-
ent. The pictures are not magical, but made to 
inspire the most dreadful imaginings of those who 
behold them.
PCs searching the wall behind the bone figurines are 
allowed DC 24 Wisdom (Perception) checks to find 
a 5-ft.-tall secret door leading to Room C28. The 
cramped, cobweb-filled corridor should unnerve 
all but the most seasoned adventurers. Medium 
or larger PCs must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving 
throw or become shaken while inside the passage-
way. Anyone failing the initial save must make 
another DC 20 Wisdom saving throw to prevent 
becoming frightened when they find the secret 
door on the other end of the corridor wedged shut 
(see room C28 for further details).
Anyone succeeding at a DC 15 Intelligence 
(Nature) or a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check can 
identify the bones as those consistent with human-
oid creatures. The corpses are those of three gnolls 
and a human, but the latter has dry and sickly flesh 
mashed almost beyond recognition.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions 4, Haunted
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A PC succeeding at a DC 15 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) check determines the miniature house 
or bone figurines hold no value.
Scaling: N/A
C28 . GHAST TOMB
A pile of crushed rocks is piled in the southeast 
corner of this chamber, blocking the hidden panel 
behind and making it impossible for anyone to enter 
this room via the secret corridor beyond. PCs clearing 
the debris are allowed a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to notice the secret wall panel, which opens 
into the narrow corridor beyond (see Room C27).
A cloud of stench lingers close by. The trail of blood 
leading from the corridor to the door continues 
into the chamber, past the half-opened doorway. 
The room seems empty except for a pile of crushed 
stone boulders in the southeast amid the remains 
of several creatures lying upon the floor in the 
northwest corner.
Entering the room disturbs a cloud of flies hovering 
above the corpses. A closer look inside reveals the 
former occupants were smashed into a mealy pulp. 
The stench obviously emanates from the corpses.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Anyone succeeding at a DC 13 Wisdom 
(Medicine) check determines there are at least three 
gnoll corpses in the pile of bones in addition to the 
remains of the ghast. The gnolls have been dead 

224
224
less than a month, and were torn apart before be-
ing left to rot. The gnoll corpses seem to have been 
purposely dismantled to prevent reanimation.
Gahrr’k, the gnoll chieftain (see Gnashing Fang Tribe 
and room C37), destroyed the ghast a few weeks 
ago, but no one other than the chieftain and Ratul 
knows that. Gahrr’k plans to use this room, but is 
airing it out until it’s hospitable.

C29-C42 . GNASHING FANG TRIBAL GROUNDS .
Nine years ago, a hunting party from the Howling 
Fang Tribe stumbled upon the entrance to the prison. 
The tribal Chieftain, Hag-grt, decided the tribe need-
ed an additional lair and sent one-third of his tribe 
into the dungeon to pave the way for the rest of his 
people. Hag-grt, however, never intended to enter 
the underground prison.
The Howling Fang Tribe was now too large to 
control, and Hag-grt too old to fight off younger and 
stronger gnoll challengers. Wise as he was, he sent 
the toughest gnolls into the dungeon and remained 
with a smaller tribe; one he could control without 
competition.
So it was, that a band of 85 gnolls entered the dun-
geon. They had great success at first, scaring off or 
killing many humanoid races and fiendish beasts sur-
rounding the entrance. But over time, they 
found the dungeon’s massive, sprawling 
tunnels too difficult to navigate and 
soon became lost. Discord broke out 
among the gnolls and a demand for 
leadership reared its head. Two vile 
gnoll brothers, Gahrr’k and Yie-ar’k, 
barked challenges, each claiming 
leadership of the group.
After some discussion, Gahrr’k 
agreed to support his brother, Yie-
ar’k. But the gnolls did not all agree 
that he should lead, and one by one, 
the gnolls stepped forth to contest 
his leadership. After six challeng-
ers, a young hot-headed gnoll 
named Attuk’k stepped forward 
and, in a ferocious battle, crippled 
Yier-ar’k. Although Attuk’k was de-
feated, Gahrr’k stepped forward and 
decapitated both of them, assuring 
his place as leader of the tribe. After that, no one 
challenged Gahrr’k’s right to lead.
Gahrr’k (Room C37) took the remaining gnolls 
and formed what became the Gnashing Fang Tribe. 
Gahrr’k then led his tribe further into the dungeon 
prison. By the time the gnolls realized that he never 
intended to leave the vast underground complex, they 
had little choice but to follow their chieftain.
Sometime after 
entering the 

225
225
dungeon, Gahrr’k met the Goblin King, Argliss. 
Though unafraid of the goblin, he worked out an 
immediate agreement with Argliss rather than fight 
(especially without a lair of their own yet). Gahrr’k dis-
covered Argliss was fearful of the wizard Arum (to the 
east), and volunteered to kill the wizard in exchange 
for a vague alliance between their two tribes. Thinking 
either the wizard or the gnolls would be destroyed 
by such an alliance, the Goblin King agreed, send-
ing along 20 of his own warriors to assist. Gahrr’k 
left the Goblin King’s domain and paused in Room 
C29 to inspect his new forces. He charged forward to 
fight the wizard, but soon realized Arum had left the 
region long ago.
Gahrr’k then took 14 goblins as slaves and killed 
the other six as an example. In the next few months, 
Gahrr’k sent several reports to the Goblin King. These 
reports described deadly battles fought against the 
wizard Arum, but in truth Gahrr’k’s tribe never found 
the wizard.

Nurganar (Room C9) searches for treasure. When encountered, he asks for a tribute of 100 gp from 
each PC. If the PCs pay up, Nurganar talks with them. Since he travels everywhere, he knows about 
the region.
As the months went by, the gnoll chieftain request-
ed more goblin reinforcements, and each time the 
Goblin King sent to their deaths. Gahrr’k, however, 
grew careless with the arrangement and a goblin 
eventually escaped slavery, and returned to tell his 
king of the gnolls’ treachery. The goblins and gnolls 
then waged war against one another, and both fac-
tions lost a great number of warriors. Now, the two 
groups have troubles of their own and avoid each 
other almost entirely. 

226
226
The first encounter between the PCs and the 
Gnashing Fang Tribe might not be a surprise meet-
ing at least not for the gnolls. They guard the eastern 
access (Room C38) and regularly patrol the various 
western entrances. Despite their chaotic nature, dis-
cipline is high among the gnoll warriors. With so few 
remaining their very survival depends on it.
The gnolls do not attack unless the PCs strike first. 
They parley with PCs and will listen to offers of diplo-
macy or trade. If the PCs convince the gnolls that they 
mean them no harm, they are escorted directly to 
Gahrr’k (Room C37). The chieftain is willing to parley 
with non-hostile PCs and cut a deal with them (see 
Room C37).
If the PCs attack any gnoll before being allowed 
passage, the remaining gnolls overwhelm the PCs 
and take them prisoner. If combat occurs, the gnolls 
capture the PCs first, using non-lethal damage. If 
the PCs killed at least one gnoll (and the gnolls know 
about it), every further encounter with the Gnashing 
Fang Tribe is hostile. If the PCs gain an upper hand 
and corner Gahrr’k, he challenges a single PC to an 
honorable duel. If he wins, he offers amnesty to any 
other PC who swears fealty to him.
C29 . WESTERN GNOLL MUSTERING 
ROOM
This large room has a door in each corner and one 
set into the eastern wall. The floor suggests a high 
traffic volume, with several scuffed paths worn 
out between each door. The walls are completely 
covered in filth, as if painted in blood.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Regular traffic from the gnoll encamp-
ment moves through here. A group of gnolls on 
patrol pass through the room once every two to 
three hours. A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check 
will determine that the walls have been spattered 
with blood repeatedly. The blood is thicker near the 
doors, but is fairly even throughout the room. The 
blood seems to be nothing more than a warning 
to enemies.
Though this room serves as a means of passage, 
the gnolls from Rooms C33 and C35 remain alert. 
When the PCs are in this chamber, allow the gnolls 
a Wisdom (Perception) check (Disadvantage for 
distance) to notice their presence. Once they notice 
the PCs, the gnolls from Room C33 enter this room 
using the eastern door 1d4+1 rounds later. 1d3 
rounds after they arrive, more gnolls from Room 
C34 come through the southeastern entrance. 
These warriors are well trained. However, like all 
members of their tribe, they are willing to parley 
with PCs that come in peace.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If a fight breaks out, the gnolls take the PCs 
prisoner rather than fighting to the death. If this is 
not possible, they fight ferociously, sending gnolls 
one at a time for reinforcements if the battle goes 
poorly for them.
If the PCs keep quiet and are not discovered, 
roll for a random encounter after 30 minutes in 
this room.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
allow the gnolls in Rooms C33 and C35 Percep-
tion checks without Disadvantage. To decrease the 
challenge, do not allow them to make a percep-
tion check.
C30 . WEAPONS STORAGE
Nothing can stop the rusted hinges from squeaking 
when the door is pushed open. The sound alerts the 
gnoll guards in Rooms C33 and C35 if they succeed 
at DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks. If they hear 
the distinctive sound, the gnolls from Room C33 will 
enter Room C29 using the eastern door 1d4+1 rounds 
later. More gnolls from Room C35 come through the 
southeastern door 1d3 rounds after the warriors from 
Room C33. These warriors are prepared for anything 
and remain in Room C29 to block the only available 
exit from this storage area.
The door to this room squeals loudly when opened. 
The place seems to be an armory or storage area 
holding a range of weaponry. A few of the larger 
weapons are placed in unevenly constructed wall 
mounts, but most are simply piled up on the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This is the Gnashing Fang Tribe’ stockpile 
of unused weapons. Since the members of the tribe 
train exclusively with only a few different types of 
weapons, the items gathered here (gathered from 
the surrounding areas over the years) are seldom 

227
227
used. Many of the weapons are in excellent con-
dition, but after years of abuse and neglect, none 
can be considered masterwork quality anymore. 
The gnolls have no use for these weapons, but 
they do not allow anyone to take any of them 
without permission from their chieftain Gahrr’k 
(Room C37).
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4, [Safe]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: With the exception of warhammers, battle 
axes, great axes, and clubs, nearly any type of stan-
dard melee weapon can be found in this room. 
The weapon sizes range from small to large and 
there is a 25% chance of any particular weapon 
being present (roll once per weapon type).
Scaling: N/A
C31 . HAUNTED ROOM
The floor of this large chamber is scattered with 
piles of crushed stone, bits of broken weapons 
and furniture, as well as rotting wood. Amidst 
the rubbish, the shape of four humanoids can be 
made out. One of these silhouettes looks human, 
but the other three are tall and have canine faces. 
The creatures’ bodies are pale where their flesh is 
exposed, and their gaze is empty.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: About a week ago, a lone wight entered 
Gnashing Fang Tribe territory, killing three gnolls 
on patrol and turning them into mindless servants. 
With the help of its newly created spawn, the crea-
ture took control of the room.
The powerful wight and its three spawn haunt this 
room. The creatures are causing major problems to 
the Gnashing Fang Tribe. Most of its warriors dare 
not face these horrors, fearing that they, like their 
former comrades, might be turned into mindless 
undead servants. Because of this, PCs who destroy 
these undead creatures and tell the gnolls about 
their deed will benefit from Advantage on their 
Charisma (Persuasion) checks while dealing with 
any member of the Gnashing Fang Tribe.
Encounter Condition: Desecration 2 or Unhallowed, 
Distracting Visions
Tactics: The four wights attack anyone entering their 
new domain. These fiends do not wield any weap-
ons in combat, preferring to close into melee as 
soon as possible.
Treasure: The original wight wears a tarnished silver 
chain (worth 10 gp if cleaned) upon which hangs an 
ivory amulet carved to look like the face of a hawk. 
This item is worth only 10 gp, but could be sold to 
historians or sages for 200 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the wight spawn’s damage by 1 die. To 
decrease the challenge, remove two wights.

C32 . WESTERN GNOLL MUSTERING 
ROOM
This large hall contains three mounds of crushed 
rock. This refuse is lined upon the southern wall, 
forming six-ft-high piles. It is obvious by the state 
of disrepair of the ceiling as well as the east and 
south walls that the rubble was once part of the 
walls and ceilings of this room. The door in the 
middle of the north wall is wide open, revealing the 
dark and narrow corridor beyond.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: It is obvious that this room suffered some 
sort of damage, but whether it was caused by a 
minor cave-in or a great battle is difficult to say. 
Though the southern wall, eastern wall, and ceil-
ing are uneven, the stone of these surfaces looks 
identical to that of the other walls and floor, which 
is relatively smooth and worn.
Before the wights took over Room C31, this area 
was used as a mustering place for the gnolls of the 
Gnashing Fang Tribe and, with the exception of the 
regular patrol passing through the chamber, it re-
mained mostly empty the rest of the time. Current-
ly, a cunning gnoll ranger guards the place.
Verk’nek, a respected gnoll ranger and loyal 
lieutenant, took it upon himself to set up a per-
manent vigil in this hall. Fearing the wights in 
Room C31 might come deeper into Gnashing Fang 
territory, Verk’nek hides behind broken stones 
in the southeast corner. He remains hidden and 
silent when patrols of Gnashing Fang warriors pass 
through the hall or if his compatriots escort the 
PCs to Gahrr’k.
If the PCs enter unescorted, Verk’nek remains 
hidden but demands in a clear voice that the PCs 
identify themselves and their business in Gnashing 
Fang territory. Verk’nek’s voice is loud and clear, 
alerting gnolls in Room C31 that succeed at a DC 
16 Wisdom (Perception) check. Four gnolls enter 
the hall 1d3 rounds later, while the other warns the 
gnolls in Room C35, who arrive 1d3 rounds after the 
group from Room C31 arrives.
Unless provoked, Verk’nek does not engage the 
PCs. Like most members of his tribe, he prefers 
diplomacy. Verk’nek’s most immediate concerns are 
the wights. If he knows the PCs destroyed the crea-
tures, his attitude shifts to friendly and he reveals 
himself. Otherwise, he remains hidden and waits 
for his tribemates to join him.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Cover, Hazardous 
Footing 16
Tactics: In battle, Verk’nek remains mostly hidden 
behind rubble, which grants him cover. He shoots 
arrows, targeting the more highly armored PCs 
first, until forced into melee. To reach Verk’nek, the 
PCs must maneuver around the rubble in the east-
ern portion of the southern wall.
Treasure: The large quiver Verk’nek carries holds 40 
arrows and is made of boiled leather and decorated 
with a multitude of tribal designs, each more intri-
cate than the next. Because of its artistic value, it is 
worth five times the value of other items of its kind 
to most people, and up to ten times that amount to 
any gnoll.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give Verk’nek 2 potions of invisibility and +5 damage 
on ranged attacks. To decrease the challenge of this 
encounter, reduce his hit points by 20.
C33 . FIRST GUARDROOM
Both doors to this room are open.
Eight long bunks are lined up on the walls of this 
chamber, taking up most of the southwestern and 
northeastern corners. There is a low wooden table 
with several stools in the middle of the room, as 
well as simple weapon racks near both entrances. 
These racks contain a variety of clubs and axes.
Initial Attitude: Neutral
Encounter: This guardroom once housed eight 
gnolls, but only six gnolls are currently here. 
While off duty, these warriors remain vigilant. 
They pay particular attention to any noise coming 
from Room C29 or Room C32. Like most of their 
tribesmen, these gnolls are content to speak with 
PCs wishing to trade information or goods. If the 
PCs wish to pass through Gnashing Fang tribal 
grounds, the gnolls insist that they speak to their 
chieftain Gahr’r’k (and escort them to Room C37).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If fighting ensues, the gnolls will charge the 
PCs. They target the warriors of the party first and 
flank them whenever they can.

229
229
The gnolls in Room C35 are automatically aware of a 
fight, and join 1d3 rounds later. Allow the sleeping 
gnolls in Room C36 a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) 
check. If they hear trouble, these warriors aid their 
fellow tribesmen in 1d4+2 rounds.
Treasure: In addition to the weapons they carry, each 
of these gnolls have 1d4 gp worth of small, uncut 
semi-precious gemstones and silver coins. Addi-
tionally, one wears a decorative bronze armband. 
Carved upon its surface in simple lines is a mighty 
bear. This trinket is worth upwards of 15 gp. The 
weapons racks near the doors holds two clubs, a 
great club, and three battle axes; all average quality. 
A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Search) check in this 
room also reveals a dagger with a jewel-embedded 
hilt worth 100 gp tucked under a crude mattress of 
a bunk, as well as a pouch containing 41 cp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two gnolls. To decrease the challenge, remove 
two gnolls.
C34 . SECOND GUARDROOM
This wide room contains the wooden frames of 
twelve bunk beds. A thin layer of dust covers the 
frames and floor of this chamber, suggesting that 
the place has not been used in a while.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room used to house gnolls from the 
Gnashing Fang Tribe, but none have used it in over 
two years.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: While this room is safe to rest in, the con-
stant traffic of gnolls just outside the doors is 
nerve-racking.
Treasure: A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) 
check spots a silver coin tucked under the leg of 
one of the bunk beds.
Scaling: N/A
C35 . THIRD GUARDROOM
A stone slab dominates the southeast corner of this 
chamber. The slab is cracked in many places and its 
surface is covered with crude but colorful graffiti. 
Several wooden stools have been placed around the 
painted flat stone “table,” and a number of empty 
jars rest upon it. There are a dozen bunk beds lining 
the north and west walls, as well as a simple iron 
rack holding several weapons beside the southern 
door, which is wide open.
Three gnolls sit in a circle in the middle of the 
room: one is holding a handful of bones while the 
others are eagerly looking on. In front of each of 
the canine-faced humanoids, stacked upon the floor 
before them, are piles of copper coins.
Initial Attitude: Neutral
Encounter: Three gnoll warriors are sitting in a 
circle in the middle of the room, playing a game 
of chance. Though their attention is focused on 
their game, they keep their ears open to any noise 
coming from Room C29. They suffer Disadvantage 
to any checks made to notice the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4
Tactics: These gnolls are more interested in acquir-
ing copper (or silver!) for use in gambling, rather 
than fighting. But, if the PCs pose any threat to 
them, or if they learn that they have harmed any 
member of their tribe, they grab their weapons and 
attack them.
In combat, two gnolls stand in the middle of 
the room, preventing the PCs from reaching their 
companion, whose task it is to alert the warriors 
in Rooms C33 and C36, as well as their chieftain in 
Room C37. This gnoll stays behind his companions 
and barks loudly. He continues to bark until he is 
either forced into melee or reinforcements arrive, at 
which point he joins the fighting.
The gnolls in Room C33 are instantly alerted and 
arrive 1d3 rounds later. Allow the sleeping warriors 
in Room C36 a DC 26 Wisdom (Perception) check 
to notice the ruckus. If they are awakened, these 
gnolls enter this guardroom 1d3 rounds later. 
Gahrr’k (Room C37) will notice the fighting if he (or 
anyone else in his throne room) succeeds at a DC 
18 Wisdom (Perception) check. They then rouse the 
warriors in Room C36 and arrive within 1d3 rounds.

230
230
Treasure: There is a total of 151 cp lying upon the 
ground of this chamber. The tokens the gnolls 
are using for their game are six elaborately carved 
bones with several designs printed upon them. 
Though these are mostly useless, a gnoll might pay 
upwards of 5 gp for them.
The stone tablet is used as both a table and canvas 
for painting. The jars lying upon it are empty save 
for a thick layer of dried paint. Most of the images 
represent animals and magical beasts hunted by 
bands of gnolls. They are crude and worthless to all 
but gnolls.
The weapons rack near the southern entrance holds 
a great-axe, two battle-axes, a warhammer, and a 
masterwork great club.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each gnoll the Second Wind Bonus Action (1/
rest: recover 1d10 + 2 hit points). To decrease the 
challenge, remove one gnoll.
C36. Fourth Guardroom
There are four humanoids in this chamber. These 
creatures are tall, with their furry bodies and 
canine-like faces exposed as they slumber upon 
large bunk beds. Though there are more bunks 
here than there are inhabitants, twelve beds in all, 
only nine of these have mattresses and woolen 
blankets upon them. There is a pair of well-polished 
great axes resting upon the wall close to the 
northwestern door.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This guardroom normally houses nine 
gnolls, but some are out on patrol. There are four 
gnoll warriors currently sleeping here. If intrud-
ing PCs rouse them, they rush out of their beds 
and ready for battle. Unlike most other members 
of their tribe, they are prone to attack PCs enter-
ing their private chamber uninvited, but PCs who 
successfully change their initial attitude through the 
use of a Charisma (Persuasion) check might avoid 
any combat.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: In battle, these warriors will fight savagely, 
and flank the more heavily armed and armored foes 
as often as they can manage.
While in combat, these gnolls utter loud barks 
to alert the rest of their tribe. Allow the gnolls in 
Room C35 and the chieftain in Room C37 a DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the ruckus. If 
they do, these gnolls join the fight in 1d3 rounds. 
Similarly, allow the gnolls in Room C33 a DC 18 
Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the commotion. 
These warriors join the battle 1d4+2 rounds after 
they are made aware of it.
Treasure: Each gnoll in this chamber carries 1d4 gp 
worth of gemstones and assorted coins. One of 
them also has a masterwork warhammer, which 
he keeps at the foot of his bed. The two great axes 
lying upon the north wall near the western door are 
sound weapons of ordinary quality.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each gnoll the Second Wind Bonus Action (1/
rest: recover 1d10 + 2 hit points). To decrease the 
challenge, remove one gnoll.
C37. Gahrr'k's Chamber
A wide black pelt covers a good portion of the floor 
in the middle of this large chamber. A bed and an 
iron chest lie in the northeast corner of the room, 
while a narrow wooden desk takes up most of the 
northwest corner. A stone chair that resembles a 
kingly throne sits upon the floor. ln the middle of 
the northern wall, the flames from several torches 
set amidst this wall burn, bathing the room in a 
warm golden light.
Upon the throne-like chair is a large figure with 
the features of a wild dog, with one ear missing, 
replaced by scar tissue. The fur of the humanoid, 
dark and disheveled, is visible where its burgundy 
clothing and polished scale mail armor do not 
cover it. The fiery eyes of the inhuman face burn 
brightly. Another male humanoid bearing similar 
features stands near the creature on the throne. 
Three other gnoll warriors are standing by the 
southern door, as if awaiting orders.

231
231
Initial Attitude: Neutral
Encounter: Gahrr’k One-Ear, the powerful, savage 
gnoll chieftain of the Gnashing Fang Tribe, lives in 
this room. Gahrr’k is a fierce and proven warrior 
who won the respect of his peers long ago. He rules 
the Gnashing Fang Tribe and his ambitions include 
the invasion of the goblin tribe to the west, for the 
war he waged against the Goblin King caused his 
tribe to suffer terrible losses. Though Gahrr’k real-
izes this is a long-term endeavor, he continues to 
dream of the day when the territory of Argliss’ the 
Goblin King falls under his control.
If members of his tribe escorted the PCs to 
Gahrr’k’s chamber and they offered no resistance 
or threat to his people, the chieftain is eager to talk 
and negotiate with them. Gahrr’k is more than will-
ing to trade information and safe passage through 
the territory controlled by the Gnashing Fang Tribe 
in exchange for weapons and other valuables. He 
is most interested in hearing what the PCs have 
learned about the other regions of the dungeon, 
especially if they have news of Argliss or his lowly 
goblins. If the PCs inform Gahrr’k that they dis-
posed of the goblin king, the chieftain is much 
more willing to help the PCs.
A cunning gnoll, Gahrr’k negotiates with the 
PCs, hoping to gain their assistance in getting rid 
of the hill giant family to the east, as well as the 
goblins to the west (should they still remain). If 
the PCs show no interest in any of these endeav-
ors but are respectful of Gahrr’k and his people, 
the chieftain will agree to grant them safe passage 
through his domain. If the PCs are interested in 
slaughtering the goblins or routing out the giants, 
Gahrr’k offers all the gold he possesses (kept in his 
chest) in exchange for the head of the three giants 
or the goblin king. The gnolls do not actively help 
the PCs in such a mission, but they offer them aid 
with menial tasks and a safe haven.
When questioned on the wizard Arum, Gahrr’k 
reveals he has never seen him and suspects he is ei-
ther dead or long ago left the dungeon. He has ex-
plored most of the wizard’s domain, and even used 
portions of it in the past to house the warriors of 
his tribe. Though he abandoned any claims he had 
on the wizards territory long ago (because of the 
many traps found therein, but also because of the 
diminished number of warriors under his control), 
Gahrr’k occasionally sends scouts to investigate. As 
far as he knows, no one lives there.
If asked about the goblin king, Gahrr’k explains 
that the goblins have long been a thorn in his 
side, but that in recent years the fighting between 
Argliss’ people and the Gnashing Fang Tribe almost 
ceased mainly because Gahrr’k does not have the 
manpower to wage a constant war against the 
little vermin.
If the PCs barter with Gahrr’k, he offers any of 
the weapons stored in Room C30 in exchange for 
axes, clubs, hammers, bows and arrows, crossbows 
and bolts, ropes, or oil flasks. Gahrr’k One-Ear has 
a small jar of stone 
salve with 
two appli-
cations left, 
enough to 
restore two 
people 
back to 
flesh. 
He is willing 
to trade it for weap-
ons or various other goods 
valued at 8,000 gp or more. Gold 
coins alone cannot account for more than half of 
this deal, however, as coins are nearly worthless 
down here. The chieftain has little else to offer, but 
listens to any offers of diplomacy the PCs make.
If the PCs barge into his chamber unescorted, 
or if the chieftain learns they killed members of 
his tribe, he picks up his enchanted great club and 
attacks. His lieutenant and three bodyguards react 
instantly.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: In combat, Gahrr’k lets his men handle the 
PCs while he drinks a draught of his potion of speed. 
The following round, he attacks heavily armored 
PCs first. Meanwhile, the bodyguards engage 
the PCs in melee and the lieutenant attacks the 
spellcasters.
These warriors bark loudly in combat, and their 
cries alarm the gnolls in Room C33 if they make a 
DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, as well as those 
in Rooms C33 and C36 if they succeed at a DC 20 
Wisdom (Perception) check. These warriors come 
to aid their chieftain 1d4+2 rounds after they have 
been made aware of the ruckus.
Treasure: In addition to the weapons they carry, the 
three gnolls have 1d4 gp worth of small jewels and 

232
232
coins. The pelts upon the chieftain’s bed are in good 
condition and could be sold for upwards of 30 gp. 
Gahrr’k carries a variety of magical items and a 
small silvery key hangs from a golden chain (worth 
35 gp) at his neck. This key unlocks the chest at the 
foot of the bed.
Gahrr’k’s chest is made of iron. It is locked and 
requires a DC 22 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check 
or the chieftain’s key to unlock. Inside, there is a 
total of 754 gp and 1,312 sp. On top of the coins 
there is a green velvet pouch containing three 
small diamonds (each worth 750 gp), a tarnished 
silvered dagger, and an empty ivory scroll case. 
When closed, this scroll case can be submerged in 
water without risk of damaging any parchment held 
inside. This object is worth 20 times the value of 
similar items of its kind.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a fiendish darkmantle (Region A), that Gahrr’k 
befriended with wild empathy. To decrease the 
challenge, remove two gnolls or the lieutenant from 
the encounter.
C38 . CELLBLOCK
The door on the eastern wall is locked and requires 
the jailer’s key (see below) or a successful DC 22 
Dexterity check. It can be unlocked from either side, 
but PCs coming from the east automatically alert the 
inhabitants.
This wide hallway contains four wooden doors with 
small windows and iron bars upon both the north 
and south walls. These eight doors open into what 
appears to be eight small cells, but only one of 
them is closed. There are two double doors made of 
wood and reinforced with iron plates in the center 
of the north wall. Similar doors appear in the 
middle of the south wall.
In the center of the room is a long table made 
out of wood with six comfortable-looking wooden 
chairs set around it. There are four gnolls in this 
room. Three of them hold great axes and shields 
while a third is armed with an axe and a whip.
Initial Attitude: Neutral
Encounter: Five of the cell doors have no locks and 
there is no obvious way to lock them. The other 
cells have workable locking mechanisms, but only 
the door to the southeastern cell is closed and 
locked. Inside this cell is the recently expired body 
of a goblin. The creature’s skin is taut and scarred 
with countless whip marks. It probably died from 
both malnutrition and abuse.
Ramk’mva, the gnoll jailer, and three gnolls are 
in charge of securing the prison, as well as pro-
tecting the borders of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. 
Ramk’mva is an old and cunning gnoll who earned 
the trust of his chieftain long ago. He is content 
with his position within the tribe and happy to 
oversee the prisons, especially since so little needs 
to be done.
To help control their territory, the gnolls keep 
the eastern door locked at all times. Ramk’mva 
holds the key, but does not let anyone through, 
unless Gahrr’k orders it.
If the PCs enter this room from the east, they 
must first pick the lock of the door. The gnolls 
stand ready to face them in battle when they enter, 
but Ramk‘mva is willing to talk. He informs them 
that this marks the boundary of the Gnashing Fang 
tribal grounds and has his warriors escort the PCs 
to Gahrr’k (in Room C37). If the PCs refuse, but 
agree not to disturb the tribe, Ramk’mva is happy 
to bid them goodbye. If the PCs threaten or attack 
the gnolls, combat ensues.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If combat is inevitable, Ramk’mva lets the 
three warriors handle the PCs while he makes his 
way to Rooms C36, C35, and C37 to alert the other 
gnolls of intruders. Though he does not wish to 
fight, if cornered or unable to escape, Ramk’mva 
fights until defeated. In combat, he uses both his 
battle-axe and whip to disarm the PCs every chance 
he gets. Meanwhile, the three warriors engage in 
melee, targeting the strongest first, using gang 
tactics whenever possible.
If fighting breaks out in the cellblock, allow 
the gnolls in Rooms C33, C34, C36, and C37 a DC 
22 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the sound 
of battle. If they do, they come to aid their fellow 
tribesmen 1d4+2 rounds thereafter.
Treasure: The cells hold nothing valuable, but each 
of the warriors in this room carries a pouch with 
1d4 gp worth of small gemstones, silver coins, and 
copper pieces. Ramk’mva the Jailer has a ring of 
keys that unlocks the eastern door as well as each 
of the three cells that still have a working locking 
mechanism upon their doors. One of the keys 

233
233
he carries also unlocks the doors of Rooms C40, 
C41, and C42, as well as the double doors south 
of Room C40.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
double the number of gnoll warriors present and 
give Ramk’mva Sneak Attack (4d6). To decrease the 
challenge, remove three gnolls.
C39 . LIEUTENANT'S QUARTERS
The doors opening into this chamber are unlocked. 
Inside the small room, cast in the heavy shadows, 
are two narrow but comfortable-looking beds. The 
beds are covered with thick animal pelts.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is the quarters of two power-
ful members of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. Verk’nek 
holds the title of lieutenant and guards’ Room C32, 
and Nirk’na is the chieftain’s right-hand man (in 
Room C37). Both are feared by the warriors of the 
tribe and trust Ramk’mva (Room C38) to protect 
their private chamber.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) 
check made in this room uncovers a small wooden 
chest hidden under one of the beds. This chest is 
unlocked and holds 37 sp, a large chunk of golden 
amber (worth 95 gp), and a bronze bracelet large 
enough to cover the entire forearm of a medium 
sized creature (worth 50 gp).
Scaling: N/A
C40 . SECURED AREA
All the doors to this room are locked. Ramk’mva 
(Room C38) possesses the only key. A DC 23 Dexterity 
check is required to unlock any of the doors.
This hallway is cast in total darkness. Upon closer 
examination, the floor here has several scuff marks 
imprinted on the cold stone. The floor, however, is 
covered with a thick blanket of dust, suggesting 
that although there once was heavy traffic in this 
area, this hall has not been entered in years.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room and the locked double doors 
leading into it serve as a safety buffer between the 
cellblock (Room C38) and the jail cells holding dan-
gerous creatures to the south (Rooms C41 and C42).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
C41 . RUST MONSTER'S PRISON CELL
The doors of this cell are made of heavy oak and 
several wooden beams nailed into the stone wall 
block it. Anyone wishing to enter this room must 
first remove the wooden planks that block the en-
trance. Each of the five beams can be pulled with a 
successful DC 20 Strength check. This action reveals a 
rusted-but-functional iron lock mechanism. A DC 19 
Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check is required to unlock 
the door unless the PCs have acquired its key from 
Room C38. The PC opening this door must succeed 
at a DC 20 Dexterity check. Failing this check results 
in the door falling off its hinges, which are completely 
eaten by rust.
Inside this large, shadowy chamber is an insect-like 
creature with four squat legs, long antennae, and 
a squat body protected by an odd hide. The walls 
of this chamber are made of stone, and, like most 
of the dungeon, seem to have been carved out 
from the sheer bedrock. These walls, however, have 
turned into a deep rust-colored shade, as if every 
speck of metal within them had rusted.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A Large rust monster is locked in this 
room. The creature has been feeding on the tiny 
residues of iron found within the walls of its prison. 
It is maddened and hateful, standing ready to 
charge anyone fool enough to unlock its cell.
While the room itself is not haunted, remaining in it 
for more than 24 hours can have damaging effects. 
Soft, almost imperceptible echoes bounce from the 
walls of the room. As time goes on, these echoes 
become harder and harder to block out, until the 
creature inside begins to think the sounds are part 
of their own mind. Anyone failing a Wisdom save 
(DC 15 + 1 per previous save) suffers 1 point of Wis-
dom damage, which takes twice as long to heal as 

234
234
normal. This save must be repeated every two hours 
beyond the first 24.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4, Fearless, [Safe]
Tactics: The monster has become mindless as a result 
of being trapped in the cell too long. It attacks the 
closest PC in metal armor and fights ferociously. It 
continues to attack the PC until his armor is beyond 
repair, then targets weapons, before moving on to 
the next PC. While rust monsters themselves do 
not normally act like trapped animals, this one has 
suffered too much from its lengthy imprisonment.
Treasure: Anything of value is now a pile of rust, 
although there is a masterwork cudgel on the floor 
in the corner of the room. Allow the PCs to dig 
through the piles all they like, however.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one rust monster. To decrease the challenge, 
have the rust monster wounded (-30 hit points).
C42 . IMPRISONED OCHRE JELLY
The doors leading into this cell are locked. The key to 
unlock them can be found in Room C38. Otherwise, a 
DC 15 Dexterity check is enough to bypass the lock.
This chamber contains a mass of yellowish 
ooze. The strange entity is oddly shaped and, 
in the darkness, moves slowly. Its slick surface 
undulates, reflecting light against the black of the 
dungeon walls.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: An ochre jelly is trapped in this cell. The 
creature has been imprisoned here for decades, and 
not even the gnolls could say who is responsible for 
imprisoning it here. Its corrosive jelly eats away at 
the stonework, turning it black.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Fear-
less, [Safe]
Tactics: As soon as anyone opens the door, the ochre 
jelly strikes the first target that gets in its way. In 
combat, it grapples and constricts its prey. If a PC 
is stunned, it moves on to the next, so it can escape 
without fear of reprisal. If the PCs leave it a way out, 
it moves into the corridor outside the door. It does 
not fight unless it has to.
Treasure: Any treasure that may have existed 
is slag now.

C43-C59 . THE WIZARD'S DOMAIN
Following the brutal deaths of the knights and pala-
dins of Merunda, and the destruction of his former 
laboratory (see Rooms C20 and C21), the wizard 
Arum established a home for himself in this section 
of the dungeon. The wizard is responsible for the 
accidental liberation of the demon Falortuligo (Room 
C21). Though Arum left long ago, this section is still 
considered his, as few creatures dare venture here 
and most inhabitants assume he is still around.
GMs wishing to complete the saga of Arum can 
place his corpse in one of the rooms where he com-
mitted suicide, somewhere in Region O. Alternatively, 
place a wraith, ghost, lich, or wight somewhere in this 
region to represent his remorse and eternal damna-
tion manifested into evil.

C43 . EMPTY STOREROOM
As the PCs approach this door, allow them each a DC 
19 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear moaning from 
inside the room.
Most of the stone floor of this room is hidden 
under thick wooden crates. Though these crates 
are sturdy, and their wood is mostly undamaged, 
many of them are opened and empty. The walls 
are blackened by age and magic. In the darkness 
of a nearby comer, the spiny silhouette of a beast 
hunkers down behind a crate.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Like many rooms in this section, this 
area was once claimed as part of the Gnashing 
Fang Tribe’s territory. Over the last decade, the tribe 
gradually relinquished control of this section, which 
was once used to store goods. Now millipedes 
and other bugs hunt through the cracks of the 
stonework.
However, before the gnolls left, they mercilessly 
chained a howler to the wall, leaving it for dead. It 
has refused to go quietly and moans pitifully. How-
ever, the room’s magical nature absorbs a great 
deal of the sound and muffles it into white noise.
The room absorbs light and sound and reduces 
their effective range to half.
Encounter Condition: Cover, Echoes 5, Fearless
Tactics: Allow the howler a Wisdom (Perception) 
check to notice the PCs enter the room. If suc-
cessful, it barks loudly, targeting everyone with its 
Mind-Breaking Howl. The howler cannot move, but 
pitifully yanks at its own chain in an attempt to free 
itself. It has no choice, but to fight to the death.
If the PCs try to befriend the creature rather than 
kill it, allow Wisdom (Animal Handling), but since 
the beast is unnatural they suffer Disadvantage.
Treasure: Though most of the crates are empty, 
some contain gear that could be helpful. The PCs 
find three tinder-twigs, a flask of antitoxin, seven 
empty glass vials, a large clay jug, a bullseye lantern, 
three pints of oil, two rusty miner’s picks, 200 ft. of 
hempen rope, and a heavy sledge.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this trap, add 
two vargouille which torment the howler, but turn 
their attention to the PCs when they enter. To 
reduce the challenge, have the howler asleep when 
they arrive.
C44 . MODIFIED CHAMBER
This oddly shaped chamber is vacant. The walls 
here are smooth and undamaged. A closer look at 
the floor reveals that its surface is spotless, save for 
a narrow space, some 10-ft. square, linking the only 
door with the southern wall. The skeletal remains 
of two goblins and one gnoll rest in one corner.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was once a tiny cell, but the 
wizard Arum changed the layout with powerful 
magic after settling in. Though no one knows what 
he intended, those with expertise with stone or ma-
sonry, as well as those accustomed to the geogra-
phy of the dungeon, can tell that something is not 
quite right with the walls of this room.
Aside from the 10-ft.-wide portion of the south 
wall directly in front of the doorway and a narrow 
frame surrounding the door on the north wall, the 
walls of this room have a different texture than the 
other walls in the dungeon. Though most of the 
walls in this region have the same stone surface, 
these are smoother, paler, and (most importantly) 
show no sign of wear. A successful DC 16 Intelli-
gence check confirms that the stone used here is 
not only different, but also that it is strange to find 
it in the dungeon. A successful DC 22 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check reveals the entire room was shaped 
with magic.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 1, Hallowed 1, [Positive 
Energy], Safe
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Buried within the walls are several wands of 
sleep, that Arum built into this chamber. The wands 
were corrupted by the chaotic magic of the region, 
and constantly target the occupants with a desire 
for restful sleep. The walls radiate strong Abjuration 
and Enchantment.
PCs spending more than 5 hours in this room, 
feel a calming peace come over them. The energy 
is soothing and beckons the PCs to stay a while. 
After 5 hours, however, they lose the will to leave. 
PCs trying to leave, must succeed at DC 16 Wisdom 
saves, or rest in a quiet corner for another 8 hours. 
This is a very good rest for the PC but it is hard to 
resist. While they heal at twice the normal rate in 
this room, a DC 16 Wisdom save is required every 
morning to summon the will to leave.

237
237
The key to escaping this perpetual trap is for 
PCs that can leave, to either carry out the ones 
who won’t leave or sleep in another room, until the 
“trapped” PCs gain the will to escape. PCs sleeping 
in the hall (waiting for their comrades) are subject 
to random encounters (once every two hours), while 
the occupants of the room are not.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the slumber take effect in 2 hours rather than 
5 hours. To decrease the challenge, the PCs only 
need to sleep one day here and can leave freely 
the next day.
C45 . FALSE TREASURE ROOM
The floor of this small room is littered with gold 
pieces, though these fail to hide the dusty floor 
beneath. In the center of the chamber is a simple 
stone altar upon which a long double-edged sword 
lies. The sword is fashioned from a silver alloy that 
shines brilliantly when light is cast upon it.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was converted into a false 
treasure chamber by the wizard Arum. A successful 
DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check is required to 
unlock the only door leading into this room, and 
the key that once served that purpose was de-
stroyed long ago.
Anyone touching the sword or the altar triggers 
the trap, which was created by Arum years ago.
 '
Magic Missile Trap. Detect: DC 15 Intelligence 
(Arcana); Disable: DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Characters in a 120-ft. range suffer 4d4+1 force 
damage each.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The longsword is endowed with a perma-
nent magic aura, making it appear as a +3 vorpal 
longsword. In truth, it’s a -2 cursed longsword. The 
gold scattered upon the floor is real and to-
tals 327 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage by 2d4. To decrease the chal-
lenge, the trap triggers only once.
C46 . TRAPPED DOORWAYS
The corridor leading south ends in a strange 
intersection. Upon the eastern wall is a wide 
doorway opening into a dark room. To the west and 
south, short hallways lead to closed doors, each 
with a locking mechanism set above their knob.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The two doors on the southern end of 
this corridor are traps. The first of these doors is 
real, but the second is fake. It is stuck inside the 
stone wall and cannot be opened by any means. 
Both doors have a complex locking mechanism set 
upon them. A successful DC 18 Dexterity check is 
required to unlock either of them.
The first door is rigged with a crushing despair trap, 
which is triggered as soon as any creature passes 
through the doorway.
 '
Crushing Despair Trap. Detect: DC 14 Intelligence 
(Arcana); Disable: DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana); Char-
acters in a 20-ft. square area must make a DC 15 
Charisma save or suffer from bane for 1 hour.
The second door, which is impossible to open – 
though its lock can be picked normally – is trapped 
as well and triggers when anyone touches it.
 '
Acid Fog Trap. Detect: DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Disable: DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters in a 
20-ft. square area must make a DC 15 Dexterity save 
for half damage or suffer 3d6 acid damage.
Though no creatures live in this room, the vargouilles 
in Room C47 are alerted when the trap is sprung.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air, [Smoke]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add cloudkill to the crushing despair trap and 
have the vargouilles (room C47) ambush the PCs 
as they exit. To decrease the challenge, remove the 
acid fog trap.

C47 . ROGUE VARGOUILLES
Both doorways leading into this chamber are wide 
open. Though these once held doors, they were taken 
out long ago. A closer inspection of these archways 
reveals the rusted remains of strong iron hinges.
If the PCs fought the chained howler (Room C43), 
the vargouilles cannot be surprised.
Beyond the empty archway is a large chamber. 
The room is dark and an undisturbed blanket of 
dust covers the floor. The stone floor is scuffed and 
marked under the dust, suggesting that traffic was 
once common here.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Four vargouilles hide in this chamber. 
These creatures recently ventured into the wiz-
ard’s domain and decided to turn this room into 
their new home. They are content to remain in the 
darkness, but attack anyone entering what they now 
consider their lair.
If the PCs use a light source, the vargouilles 
automatically notice them. Otherwise, allow the 
vargouilles the appropriate Wisdom (Perception) 
checks. They remain hidden, waiting for the PCs to 
enter. If it takes more than 10 rounds for the PCs to 
reach their lair after they were spotted, the var-
gouilles come after them instead.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Conceal-
ment, Fear 14, Fearless, Unhallowed
Tactics: The vargouilles use shriek as soon as they 
reveal themselves (or the moment they are spotted). 
They close in melee, biting their foes. Though they 
do not necessarily fight in unison, these creatures 
are savage and fight to the death. They target the 
weakest opponents first, and do not hesitate to 
attack the wounded.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the vargouilles’ hit points by 6.
C48 . FORMER GREAT HALL
Torches set amidst heavy bronze sconces are 
ablaze, their light revealing a massive stone table 
that dominates the center of this large hall. Broken 
wooden stools and a rotten tapestry (now piled 
in the corner of the room) complete the collection 
of furniture, which is covered with dust. Three 
corridors lead into this place, but the one opening 
in the middle of the eastern wall is blocked.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The Gnashing Fang Tribe previously used 
this room as a meeting hall. Though they have long 
abandoned the place, it remains unchanged.
This great hall is empty and has not seen use 
in years. Only the vargouilles in Room C47 have 
passed through it in recent months. The stone table 
in the center of the place is solid and its surface is 
scarred with various claw marks. These were de-
signed by the gnolls that once lived here, but mean 
nothing special.
The corridor leading east ends abruptly. When 
Arum defeated the hill giant in Room C97, he creat-
ed a permanent stone wall here to block the access. 
A successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
made here reveals that this portion of the wall is 
indeed a wall of stone. It is next to impossible to 
dig through this wall.
There is a barely noticeable irregularity in the 
center of the western wall. PCs succeeding at a 
DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check notices narrow 
grooves upon the stone surface, suggesting that 
a portion of the wall is actually a hidden panel. A 
close examination of this panel reveals a tiny hole 
in its center. The device is clearly some sort of 
keyhole, but its key is yet undiscovered (by the PCs). 
A successful DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check 
is enough to unlock the mechanism. Upon success, 
the panel sinks into the floor, revealing Room C51 
beyond. The secret door closes itself one minute 
after it is opened.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs observing the degraded tapestry dis-
cern faded colors, but no particular image comes to 
mind based on the design. The item is worthless. 
The torches have continual flame cast on them.
Scaling: N/A

C49 . FORMER BARRACKS
Both doors to this room are locked and require a 
successful DC 24 Dexterity check to open.
Eerie lights and dancing shadows project upon the 
walls, distracting you. The room beyond the door 
is in disarray, as if ransacked. Splintered wooden 
bunk-bed frames line the southern and eastern 
walls. Though no mattresses or bed sheets cover 
them now, they could once sleep twelve, and if 
suitable bedding could be acquired, they could 
still be used.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room once housed warriors of the 
Gnashing Fang Tribe. Over the years, the tribe 
suffered great losses and eventually abandoned the 
place. Before fleeing, they used this place to trap a 
feral ghoul they were unable to kill. The beast has 
been captive for many months and seeks to destroy 
anyone who enters (including the PCs).
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Fearless, [Safe]
Tactics: The ghoul is fearless and stronger than most 
of its kind. It waits above the door and descends 
on the last person to enter. The PCs need a DC 25 
Wisdom (Perception) check to notice it as they enter 
and gain Advantage only if they are looking straight 
up as they enter (the monster knows exactly where 
to hide in the room’s shadow).
During the first round, the ghoul takes full 
advantage of its abilities, attacking its victim with 
two claws, one bite, and its special rake attack. The 
ghoul’s claws are razor-sharp from many years 
of scratching and sharpening upon the dungeon 
walls, and its critical threat range is increased 
accordingly.
Treasure: A torch imbued with continual flame was left 
behind, perhaps to torment the nocturnal ghoul. 
The torch was broken into many pieces, but the con-
tinual flame still casts light from a single 3-in. piece 
of wood. A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) 
check discovers a gold earring (worth 25 gp) tucked 
between one of the bunks and the wall.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
allow the ghoul to sneak attack the first PC for +3d6 
damage. In addition, at the end of the first round, 
have the PCs make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw 
or be Frightened. To decrease the challenge, have 
the ghoul be surprised by the PCs.
C50 . THE TOMB OF NARR'KRR
Both doors leading into this chamber were sealed 
with thick wax, applied to the inside of the door 
frames long ago. Because of the wax, a successful DC 
17 Strength check is required to open each door.
The doors opening into this chamber are extremely 
hard to push open, but once done, a stench 
emanates from within. Inside this large room is a 
simple wooden desk, a large stool, an iron chest, 
and a wide bed. Upon the bed is the source of the 
powerful smell: a tall humanoid skeleton with bits 
of rotted flesh sticking to the yellowed bones. The 
corpse is dressed in rotten clothing, but a large gold 
torc hangs from a chain upon its neck.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Narr’krr, a powerful gnoll warrior, used 
this chamber as his private abode and office. 
Narr’krr suffered a crippling injury six years ago 
and, shortly after his death, was laid to rest in this 
chamber, and both doors were sealed.
With a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) 
check or DC 11 Intelligence (Nature) check, PCs ob-
serving the corpse can determine this creature was 
a particularly large gnoll.
Encounter Condition: N/A

240
240
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Upon the desk are a handful of blank scroll 
pages, which are dried and yellowed but still usable, 
and an empty vial of ink. The chest here contains 
rotted clothing and a +1 hand axe. Lastly, Narr’krr 
spent his last few months studying some arcane 
notes and while he never understood them, he hid 
them away in a cache under the table. A successful 
DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a small 
bone scroll case with an arcane scroll in it. The scroll 
contains the spells gaseous form, illusionary script, 
suggestion, and water breathing.
PCs searching the body automatically find a gold 
torc set upon a heavy chain. The chain is made of 
tarnished bronze rings and worth a mere 3 gp. The 
surface of its crescent shape is engraved with multi-
ple tribal designs. It is worth 250 gp in civilization, 
but at least twice as much to a gnoll. Members of 
the Howling Fang Tribe (that never ventured into 
the dungeon), and most Gnashing Fang gnolls 
would pay up to 1,000 gp for such a treasure, as it 
is an heirloom of their people.
If the PCs attempt a trade with Gahrr’k (Room 
C37), a DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check is nec-
essary to get both stone salves for the heirloom. He 
easily trades one for it.
Scaling: N/A
C51 . WIZARD'S LABORATORY
To enter this room, the PCs must find the secret pan-
el in Room C48. This panel resets itself one minute 
after being opened. PCs caught on this side instantly 
notice the irregularity in the center of the eastern 
wall, provided they know where to look. From this 
side, a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check is enough 
to notice the narrow grooves upon the stone surface 
as well as the tiny keyhole in the middle of the panel. 
A successful DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check is 
still required to unlock the mechanism, but the prop-
er key rests on the table in this chamber.
A low table lies in the middle of this chamber, 
which is illuminated by the flames of four torches, 
each set into wall sconces in the corners. Upon the 
table are a variety of clay flasks, glass vials, and 
pots, some of which contain liquids. Beside these is 
a minuscule silvery rod.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Shortly after the escape of the demon in 
room C21 and the terrible deaths of the knights of 
Merunda, Arum discovered this hidden chamber 
and built another laboratory here. Judging by the 
dust covering everything in this room, it’s clear it 
hasn’t been used in some time.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The narrow rod upon the table is the key 
that unlocks the secret panel leading into this 
room. The various flasks contain three potions of 
giant strength, five potions of speed, two potions of 
resistance ( fire), and two potions of cure disease. In 
addition to these items, there are seven empty glass 
vials, three clay jars, two small cooking pans made 
of blackened iron, an alembic, and a host of crude 
alchemical tools. The four torches have continual 
flame cast on them.
Scaling: N/A
C52 . WIZARD'S STUDY
Like the laboratory, the burning flames of torches 
set into each corner illuminate this room. A 
comfortable-looking chair rests at the foot of the 
southern wall, facing the chamber’s only door. 
Beside the chair is a small wooden table, on which 
is placed a thick leather-bound volume, two vials of 
black ink, and an ink pen.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Arum used this chamber to meditate and 
conduct magical research. Like most rooms in this 
part of the dungeon, the furniture is blanketed with 
dust. A closer look suggests that no creature has 
entered this place in years.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The most significant treasure in this 
chamber is an unmarked journal. Written in Dra-
conic (the first half ) and scrawled in Common (the 
second half ), the journal reveals a portion of the 
wizard‘s account.
While trying to gain insight into his future, 
Arum was contacted by a divine entity known as 
Merunda, a minor goddess of the oceans, trav-
el, and vigilance. The deity told him to come to 
the dungeon prison and wait for others to arrive. 

241
241
Shortly after Arum arrived, he performed exper-
iments to discover why extraplanar travel was 
impossible here. After successfully opening a tiny 
extraplanar rift, an angel confronted him (mental-
ly), forbidding him from ever attempting such an 
experiment again. Arum goes on to explain that 
the angel was imprisoned with a powerful demon 
in this area, and that it would not allow anyone to 
release this evil. The journal ends shortly after the 
arrival of three paladins of Merunda.
After several blank pages, the writing contin-
ues, only the handwriting is more chaotic and the 
verbiage more difficult to decipher. PCs succeeding 
at a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check can 
discover the following information.
Arum (now referring to himself in the third per-
son) communicated with what he believed was an 
angel trapped within the dungeon to learn how to 
make his forge more efficient. Following the angel’s 
advice, the wizard placed powerful wards to reflect 
the heat generated by his forge back to it. What 
the wizard had not realized, however, was that the 
wards he placed upon the wall would facilitate Ash‘s 
freedom. It was indeed the cunning demon that 
had communicated with him, not an angel. The de-
tails of the account are vague, but the text is filled 
with remorse. The author blames himself for Ash‘s 
escape, which ultimately led to the Paladins’ fall.
The two vials contain dried and unusable ink, 
but the ink pen is still in good shape. The four 
torches have continual flame cast on them.
Scaling: N/A
C53 . ARUM'S PRIVATE SANCTUM
A wide bed covered with dusty blankets lies at 
the foot of the southern wall of this chamber. 
Beside the bed is a wooden table with a lantern 
on it. There is an iron chest at the foot of the bed. 
Its locking mechanism is clearly visible from the 
room’s only entrance.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This chamber was Arum’s private bed-
room. When the wizard left the dungeon, he 
abandoned some of his personal effects, but did 
not deactivate the trap he placed here. Judging by 
the dust covering everything in this room, it is clear 
that no one has visited in a long time.
The doorway leading to Arum’s chamber is rigged 
with a magical trap (something Arum doesn’t even 
remember doing). Anyone entering the room 
must make a DC 13 Wisdom save or suffer from 
the bestow curse trap. The trap automatically resets 
after 6 rounds. It can affect the same person more 
than once.
 '
Bestow Curse Trap. Detect: DC 19 Intelligence (Ar-
cana); Disable: DC 19 Intelligence (Arcana); Charac-
ters entering the room must make a DC 13 Wisdom 
save or have disadvantage on all Wisdom ability 
checks and saving throws for 24 hours.
Encounter Condition: Cursed 5, Haunted
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The chest at the foot of the bed is locked 
and requires a DC 22 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) 
check to open. It contains two blank spell books, 
three sets of wizard’s robes in various shades of 
blue, and six oil flasks. The lantern upon the table is 
still in good shape. Copper and silver coins with the 
faces melted off are scattered along the bottom of 
the chest.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the bestow curse trap affect Intelligence as well 
as Wisdom. To decrease the challenge, replace the 
bestow curse trap with a burning hands trap.
C54 . GHASTLY GUARD POST
Half a dozen gnoll carcasses lie in the middle 
of this dark room. A closer look at the corpses 
indicates these warriors died years ago in brutal 
combat. The weapons they wielded remain 
with them.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This chamber was once a guard post 
used by the members of the tribe. The bodies are 
six gnolls from the Gnashing Fang Tribe. These 
creatures died at the hands of a powerful hill giant 
that ventured into this section. The tribe aban-
doned this room shortly after this battle, leaving the 
dead behind.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs searching the corpses find three rusty 
great axes, two great clubs, a morningstar, and four 

242
242
large steel shields. One of these shields is a mas-
terwork item. The gnolls also carry a total of 21 gp 
worth of semiprecious gemstones and coins.
Scaling: N/A
C55 . RIGGED FALSE DOOR
Four doors open into this dark intersection. Though 
the three doors set amidst the three different 
eastern walls do not seem to lock, a black iron lock 
is set in the one at the end of the western corridor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The door at the end of the western cor-
ridor is false. It is set in the stone of the wall and 
cannot be opened, but it nevertheless contains a 
complex locking mechanism. The western door is 
also trapped. It was designed to fool the inhabi-
tants into believing that some powerful creature 
was imprisoned on the other side. A successful DC 
21 Dexterity check is enough to unlock the mech-
anism upon the door, but it can unfortunately not 
be opened. Anyone touching the door or lock also 
triggers its deadly magical trap.
 '
Cloudkill Trap. Detect: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Disable: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters in a 
20-ft. sphere must make a DC 15 Constitution save 
for half damage or suffer 5d8 poison damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a cone of cold to the cloudkill trap. To decrease 
the challenge, replace the cloudkill trap with a slow 
trap; its effect lasts 1 day.
C56 . FLOODING ROOM
The floor of this intersecting corridor is surprisingly 
clean, but there is a layer of green moss covering 
the walls, which forms an almost straight line 
around the room some three feet from the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This intersection is rigged with a potent 
flooding room trap. Unfortunately, the powerful 
earthquakes that modified parts of the dungeon 
also damaged this device.
Four rounds after the PCs enter this room, the 
doors shut tightly and loud clicking sounds are 
heard as they are locked into place. Water then 
pours from minuscule cracks upon the floor, 
forming a pool in the room. The water rises at a 
rate of 1 ft. per round, but fortunately for travelers, 
the trap is not as effective as it once was, and the 
water stops rising after three rounds (at the level 
where the moss can be seen). The sound of running 
water continues to be heard until 10 rounds elapse. 
At the end of this period, everything is quiet for 15 
minutes before the water level drops. 10 additional 
rounds later, the water dissipates, and the doors 
instantly unlock themselves.
PCs unlocking any of the doors must succeed at 
a DC 23 Dexterity check or remain trapped inside 
the room. Disarming the trap requires a DC 25 
Dexterity check, which prevents the doors from 
shutting on their own as well as preventing water 
from pouring into the corridor.

C57. Hazardous Tunnel
A narrow tunnel was dug from the bedrock of the 
dungeon, connecting two small chambers together. 
The uneven corridor and the rooms it connects are 
filled with a multitude of stone debris. It’s clear the 
stone boulders tumbled from the walls and ceiling.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Demons imprisoned in the dungeon 
dug a tunnel linking both ends of this room, which 
were once separate. The demons eventually escaped 
when the geography of the dungeon changed, 
centuries ago. Now, however, this room is a dan-
gerous place to be and the ceiling looks like it could 
collapse at any moment.
PCs examining this room notice the precarious 
state of the place. A successful DC Intelligence 
check confirms that journeying through this place 
is dangerous and might result in an avalanche.

243
243
PCs moving through this room must do so care-
fully. They must succeed at a DC 15 Dexterity check 
to avoid a cave-in. Each PC failing this check causes 
several large blocks of stone to fall to the ground, 
dealing 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage to 
everyone in the room. This damage is cumulative, 
so anyone else failing the check adds another 3d6 
points of bludgeoning damage. PCs succeeding at 
a DC 15 Dexterity save cut the damage in half.
Encounter Condition: Tremors 18
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
double the damage caused by the cave-in. To de-
crease the challenge, no extra damage is suffered if 
more than one PC fails his Dexterity check.
C58 . SACKED BED CHAMBER
This room is filled with debris. There are many 
broken wood poles and planks, the remnants of 
a bed, as well as the broken remains of a small 
cabinet. The wooden pieces are scattered about 
the room, and it is obvious that someone, or 
something, smashed everything here.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This chamber once housed the only 
healer of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. This wise old 
gnoll died long ago, however, and his bedroom was 
sacked. PCs looking at the debris also find several 
strips of rotted cotton as well as the dusty remains 
of dried herbs. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Med-
icine) check made here confirms that these items 
were once part of a large healer’s kit.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 23 Wisdom (Perception) 
check through the debris here reveals a universal 
solvent and two potions of superior healing.
Scaling: N/A
C59 . HALL OF MIRAGES
This room is unlike anything encountered 
previously. The walls are made out of dark brown 
whole wooden logs, reminiscent of a comfortable 
log cabin. Upon the southern wall is a thick frame 
made of red bricks that outline a hearth. Flames 
burn within the hearth, raising the temperature 
of the room to a comfortable level. There are 
tables around the room, as well as stools, and 
the trophies of various hunting trips hanging on 
the walls.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Arum set a powerful illusion into this 
hall, as well as a lethal trap. This great chamber is 
reminiscent of a tavern, though without a bar or 
barkeep. Arum placed a powerful illusion here, and 
a DC 21 Intelligence save reveals that this room is, 
like most in the dungeon, cut from stone. Those 
who fail believe it to be a tavern, complete with 
darts, drinks, kegs, and the like. The room is totally 
empty, and the stone floor is cloaked in dust. PCs 
walking 10 ft. or more release a magical trap, which 
affects everyone one round later.
 '
Phantasmal Killer Trap. Detect: DC 22 Intelligence

acters entering room DC 18 Wisdom save or suffer

add fear to each phantasmal killer trap. To decrease 
the challenge, have the phantasmal killer trap target 
only a single creature.

C60-C68 . PATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS .
This section was originally designed as a deadly path 
preventing demonic and devilish creatures from 
venturing too far. The angel and archon wardens of 
the region could safely walk from Rooms C60 though 
Room C68 and even used some of these chambers 
to rest. However, non-lawful good creatures found it 
more difficult to make the journey.
When Arum discovered this area, he essentially kept 
it as it was. However, he used Room C64 to honor 
the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives 
in the service of their god and who died fighting the 
powerful demon of the dungeon. Arum’s testimony 
of the paladin’s battle is engraved upon the walls of 
this chamber in a maddeningly random combination 
of Common, Draconic, and Abyssal.
PCs will notice that the stone surfaces of the walls, 
floor, and ceiling are whiter in Rooms C61-C67. In ad-
dition, the material from which they had been hewn 
is different than in other parts of the vast complex 
and no dust has accumulated anywhere. Lastly, the 
spotless white stone surfaces of these halls are illu-
minated by an unknown light source, as if under the 
permanent effect of daylight.
C60 . SECRET ENTRANCE
The door leading to Room C61 is actually a secret 
stone panel that is very difficult to notice (DC 30 Wis-
dom (Perception) check). The secret panel upon the 
eastern wall is a 10-ft.-by-10-ft. section of stone that 
sinks into the floor when opened. The secret door 
opens instantly if a PC with the Mark of the Righ-
teous (see Room C21 and C103) walks within 5 ft. of 
it, revealing bright light on the other side. The panel 
remains open for 1 minute before rising back into 
place. A PC with the Mark of the Righteous caught on 
the other side of this doorway needs only to touch the 
secret wall panel to open it.
The corridor widens here but leads to a bare wall. 
There is no dust here, but the place is undisturbed, 
suggesting that no one has ventured into this 
hallway for years.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: If no one has the Mark of the Righteous, 
the PCs cannot gain access to this chamber, and 
thus they cannot reach the eastern rooms of this 
region. Most importantly, the special key in Room 
C103 is unavailable to them. If the PCs never met 
Zrino (Room C21), or if they refused the Mark of 
the Righteous, Zrino arrives, offering the Mark. If 
the PCs attacked the lantern archon, however, he 
is not here.

C61 . GOLDEN WEAPON RACK
The western wall of this chamber contains an 
empty weapon rack. The structure of this fixture 
is composed of four long bars that curve slightly. 
Each of these bars are made of pure gold, 
decorated with a feather pattern. The golden 
feathers are linked to one another and form an 
intricate design. Upon the northern door, written 
in golden Celestial runes are the words: “Leave all 
weapons behind.”
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was designed so that anyone 
entering Room C62 would do so unharmed. The 
weapon rack is enchanted and all those leaving 
their arms behind find the journey through Rooms 
C67 and beyond more pleasant than it has been. 
The rack is also the key to unlock the door leading 
to Room C62. Once a weapon is placed, it cannot 
be removed from the rack, but an exact duplicate 
awaits in Room C67. If the PC returns to this room, 

245
245
the weapon is gone (unless the weapon was placed 
again in Room C67).
A PC with the Mark of the Righteous (see Room 
C21 and C103) walking within 5 ft. of the doorway is 
instantly aware of its existence. They also know how 
to open it, by simply touching the hidden panel. 
Only those with the Mark of the Righteous can 
open it in this fashion, however. When opened, the 
stone panel sinks to the floor.
The secret panel upon the eastern wall of this 
chamber is 5-ft.-by-5-ft. It is made from the same 
white stone as the walls of the room from this side, 
but, on the other side, the surface is as ordinary as 
that of the dark corridor leading to Room C95. Like 
the secret doorway in Room C60, this panel sinks 
into the floor when opened. The panel remains 
sunk inside the floor for 1 full minute before rising 
back into place. PCs without the Mark of the Righ-
teous cannot open this door.
The door upon the north wall is locked. There 
are no obvious locking mechanisms, and it cannot 
be unlocked with normal means. The only way to 
unlock this door, and gain access to Room C62, is 
by placing weapons into the golden rack upon the 
western wall. A minimum of 1 weapon per PC must 
be placed in the rack. Once this is done, the weap-
ons disappear and the door opens by itself, allowing 
the PCs access to Room C62.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 4
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The weapons rack is made of gold and is of 
significant value (2,000 gp or more). It is, however, 
bolted to the wall and magically maintained. PCs 
may pull the rack out from the wall with a success-
ful DC 25 Strength check. Doing so not only cancels 
its enchantment, but also ruins the item, which 
crumbles into a fine black dust. Destroying the rack 
before unlocking the door prevents access to Room 
C62 permanently.
Scaling: N/A
C62 . ANTECHAMBER OF LAW
This square room is empty, but upon the perfectly 
smooth white stone floor is an intricate carving of 
an angel with outspread wings. The angelic figure 
sculpted into the floor holds a wide shield with a 
scale and sword design in its center.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A successful DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) 
or DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the 
symbol on the shield represents Order. This sym-
bol is used by angels and archons, as well as many 
religious orders that uphold the law.
This room contains a powerful device that affects 
all non-lawful beings. Any non-lawful creatures en-
tering this room must make a DC 23 Wisdom save 
or be poisoned for 4d6 minutes. Lawful-aligned 
characters are not affected by this and unarmed 
non-lawful characters who placed all their weapons 
in the rack in Room C61 or Room C67 gain advan-
tage on their save.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 6, Positive 
Energy, Safe
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the magical device’s saving throw by +3. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the save DC by -5.
C63 . THE HALL OF LAW
Silken sheets are piled up all along the floor of 
this large hall. There are eight silk blankets on 
either side of the room, placed near the eastern 
and western wall. Though there are no beds under 
them, the blankets look rather inviting. Their deep 
blue shades dramatically contrast the clean white 
walls of the Hall.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was a meditation hall. The 
silken sheets are surprisingly comfortable and lying 
on them feels like lying on a soft feathery mattress. 
Anyone stealing a blanket receives a deadly elec-
trical blast upon exiting through either door. The 
discharge deals 12d6 points of lightning damage, 
but a DC 22 Constitution save reduces it by half.

246
246
Lawful PCs resting here will rejuvenate lost hit 
points at a rate of 5 per hour. In addition, resting 
for 8 hours also recuperates 1d3+1 lost points of one 
ability score damage they suffered. Upon awaken-
ing, they are under the effects of bless for 24 hours. 
Non-lawful PCs do not benefit from these effects.
Chaotic PCs find no respite here. No matter 
how long they sleep, they gain none of the bene-
fits normally bestowed by rest. Furthermore, upon 
entering this room, chaotic-aligned PCs must make 
a DC 22 Wisdom save or immediately gain a level 
of exhaustion. Chaotic PCs who left all their weap-
ons in the rack in Room C61 or C67 gain advantage 
on the save.

Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have all chaotic creatures entering this room 
instantly gain a level of exhaustion and raise the 
damage caused by the electrical discharge to 16d6. 
To decrease the challenge, allow non-lawful PCs to 
rest normally in this room and reduce the damage 
caused by the discharge to 8d6.
C64 . AN ACCOUNT OF THE LAST BATTLE
Gouges scar the pure white walls of this hall. The 
markings are letters of exquisite quality carved 
into the stone. The writing is in Celestial, but 
under each phrase are Common runes translating 
the language.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Arum used this room to record the 
account of the brave, final stand of the Paladins of 
Merunda. The account was made by Arum, who 
used both languages to make sure any good soul 
traveling into this chamber would know the truth. 
PCs succeeding at a DC 22 Wisdom (Insight) check, 
can sense sadness in the words and the style of 
writing, as if the writer had given up hope.
PCs reading the inscriptions on the walls learn 
that Merunda (a minor goddess of the ocean, trav-
el, and vigilance) summoned the last of her follow-
ers to this dungeon. At first they did not know why 
the deity had called them to the forgotten place, 
but the servants of the goddess eventually learned 
they were expected to fight the great demon held 
within the confines of a special prison cell. They 
were also expected to die in their efforts. That is, all 
except Arum, whose signature can be found at the 
end of the account.
Moments before the tragic event, the paladins 
of Merunda were told the demon would escape 
its prison and that a mighty angel would slay the 
fiend, provided they sacrificed their lives to help 
it. When the time came, and the demon broke 
through the wall of its prison cell, the servants of 
Merunda stood ready to face the creature. They 
sacrificed their lives to allow the angel to kill the 
demon. Only Arum survived the onslaught, and the 
wizard saw the angel dissolve into thin air once the 
demon was dead.
Though the narrator does not explain the events 
leading to the demon’s escape, he does insist that 
without the efforts of the followers of Merunda, this 
evil would not have been destroyed. And he notes 
that he wrote the account upon the walls to honor 
the memory, valor, and sacrifice of the deceased.

C65 . THE HALL OF GOODNESS
Large sofas of deep blue velvet dominate the 
eastern and western walls of this large hall. In the 
center is a low blue marble table. The furniture is 
elegant and, like the white stone surfaces of the 
hall, surprisingly clean.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Good-aligned PCs entering this hall 
immediately feel relaxed. Those suffering from ail-
ments such as poison, disease, or a curse also feel 
that they could get better if they stay here a while 
longer. Every hour a good-aligned PC remains, they 
are cured of one of the following effects: poison, 
disease, blindness, deafness, curse, or paralysis. 
Non-good PCs do not gain any of these benefits.
For evil characters: this place is beyond unnerv-
ing, if not hostile. Upon entering the hall, they 

247
247
must succeed at a DC 30 Wisdom save or become 
blind and deaf. They also reduce their maximum 
HP by 4d8 for as long as they remain here. Remov-
ing blindness/deafness restores their sight and 
hearing. PCs who placed all their weapons in the 
rack in Room C61 or Room C67 gain advantage 
on the save.

Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter,

PCs either blind or deaf, not both, and reduce the 
save DC by 5.
C66 . ANTECHAMBER OF GOODNESS
An intricate pattern is carved into the center of 
this room. The design represents a handsome male 
angel with powerful wings protruding from its 
back. The angel upon the floor has one hand above 
his head, partly outstretched in front of him. His 
other hand holds a delicate lyre at his side.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Religion) 
or DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the 
pose of the angel signifies peace. Angels, archons, 
and members of religious institutions frequently 
depict their greatest heroes in this position.
This room is imbued with strong magic that 
affects all non-good creatures. Non-good PCs en-
tering this room must make a DC 22 Wisdom save 
or become frightened for 4d6 minutes and have 
their maximum hit points reduced by 3d6 until the 
end of their next Long Rest. Good characters are 
not affected and non-good characters who placed 
all their weapons in the rack in Room C61 or Room 
C67 gain advantage on the save.
Encounter Condition: [Fear 22], Hallowed 6, Positive 
Energy, Safe
Tactics: N/A

Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter,

age to 1d6.
C67 . SILVERY WEAPON RACK
The southern door is locked, but has no locking 
mechanism upon it. It cannot be unlocked through 
normal means and the only way to open it is by plac-
ing weapons onto the silvery shelves. Each PC must 
place at least one weapon in the rack. Like Room C61, 
these weapons cannot be removed.
An empty silver weapon rack is placed upon the 
western wall of this otherwise empty room. The 
rack is made from seven curved bars embellished 
with leafy patterns of wonderful design. The words, 
“Leave all weapons behind” are written in silver 
Celestial runes in the center of the southern door.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Like Room C61, this chamber was de-
signed to allow everyone entering Rooms C62-C66 
to leave their weapons behind. The weapon rack, 
although fashioned from a different material, func-
tions as the one in Room C61. It is also the key to 
unlock the door leading to Room C66.
PCs who left their weapons behind in Room 
C61, and vice versa, find their weapons here. When 
non-evil PCs take their arms from the rack in Room 
C67, they feel the weapons are charged with potent 
energy. The weapons of lawful good PCs become 
+2 weapons. The duration of these enchantments 
lasts for 1 day plus a number of days equal to the 
character’s Wisdom bonus (if any). Weapons may 
not be enhanced more than once per month, so 
PCs journeying through this section several times 
within a short period may not benefit from this 
more than once, unless they place different weap-
ons in the rack.
The magical rack does not enhance the weapons 
of non-lawful or non-good PCs. The weapons of 
evil PCs are imbued with powerful enchantments 
that bestow them a -2 penalty for 1d4+1 days. An 
evil weapon placed in the rack is destroyed and 
never reappears.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 4

Treasure: The weapon rack in this room is made of 
the purest silver (it is worth approximately 2,000 
gp). PCs can pull the rack from the wall with a suc-
cessful DC 22 Strength check. Doing so, however, 
cancels its magical effect and ruins the item, which 
instantly crumbles into a fine black dust. Destroying 
the rack before unlocking the southern door also 
prevents access to Room C66.
Scaling: N/A
C68 . SECRET DOORWAY
The secret stone panel sinks into the floor, revealing 
a brightly lit hallway leading south. The spotlessly 
clean corridor is narrow and illuminated by an 
unnatural, unseen source. It leads to a simple door.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A hidden panel opens into the narrow 
corridor leading south. It is impossible to notice, 
but those with the Mark of the Righteous automat-
ically learn of its existence. The secret door is a 5-ft.-
by-5-ft. panel that sinks into the floor when opened. 
It opens automatically if a PC with the Mark of 
the Righteous (see Room C21 and C103) touches it 
and remains open for 1 minute before rising back 
into place.
If no one has the Mark of the Righteous, the PCs 
cannot gain access to this room. If the PCs never 
encountered Zrino (Room C21), or if they met the 
lantern archon but refused the Mark of the Righ-
teous, Zrino appears her now to offer the Mark, 
unless the PCs attacked him before.

C69-C79 . BLACK DRAGON TERRITORY .
Before Arum fled the dungeon, his scattered mind 
created several monstrosities in this section, bring-
ing to life inanimate objects (like the furniture) and 
turning mindless mold into powerful, destructive 
oozes. Months and years passed as Arum hid under 
the shadow of the dragon, before fleeing the region 
in search of clarity and to ease his worried mind.
Over the years this section became home to a 
number of creatures, including hill giants (too stupid 
to stay away), and a number of gnoll patrols who 
eventually learned to leave well enough alone. Now, 
uncontested, a mighty black dragon named Nardarik 
controls Rooms C69-C79. This cunning dragon is 
aware of every secret door and hidden passage in his 
territory. Nardarik is smart and agile, and frequently 
patrols his lair to ensure no other inhabitants enter 
it. While journeying through Nardarik‘s territory, the 
PCs notice several scuff marks upon the floor and 
walls. Nardarik’s claws and scaly body created these 
marks. They are especially obvious in narrow corridors 
and chambers.
When Nardarik encounters the PCs, he is hostile. 
Unless they offer great treasures, the dragon attacks. 
He wants nothing to do with the PCs. However, if 
they buy their way out, Nardarik will honor the bar-
gain and show them to the exit.

the region.
C69 . FIRST MARKED ROOM
The surface of the stone floor and walls here is 
heavily pitted and scarred. A closer examination 
suggests that part of the rock face was burned. 
There are also several marks upon the floor, 
suggesting frequent traffic.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The walls and floor of this room are dam-
aged. Their stone surfaces are melted and uneven, 
as though a potent acid had eaten through the rock. 
Nardarik (Room C77), the black dragon that makes 
his lair in this area, is responsible for the markings.
There is nothing special in this room aside from 
the acid-damaged floor and walls. A successful 
DC 12 Intelligence check made here confirms the 
walls and floor were damaged with a strong acid. 

250
250
Another check (DC 15) suggests the acid was thrown 
or projected against the stone surfaces, as though 
through a jet or thrown flask. A third check (DC 
18) reveals the acid’s source was monstrous and 
unnatural.
A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check 
uncovers a simple secret panel at the end of the 
western corridor. This panel is made from the same 
stone as the walls and is just as damaged. It tilts 
precariously upon hidden hinges towards the inside 
of this room when opened. A narrow groove into 
the stone surface allows PCs to pull it open, but a 
successful DC 15 Strength check is required.
Encounter Condition: [Fog 10 or Smoke]
Tactics: After the PCs spend 30 minutes in this room, 
roll for a random encounter.

C70 . DEVASTATED CHAMBER
The three secret doors leading into this room are 
simple stone panels that can be noticed with DC 20 
Wisdom (Perception) checks. When pushed with a 
successful DC 15 Strength check, they swing open, 
revealing strong iron hinges hidden within the 
archway. PCs opening the panels from the outside 
must use a narrow groove that grips the panel (also 
requiring a Strength check).
The two secret doors in the corridor to the north-
west are identical to those from this room.
This room is filled with broken furniture, crushed 
boulders, and bone fragments. The debris is piled 
at the foot of the western wall, and a simple 
looking door separates them in two mounds. 
Within the debris are bits of rusty iron, thorns, and 
rotted clothing.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: When Nardarik took control of the sec-
tion, he fought powerful hill giant stragglers. The 
dragon wasted no time hunting down his enemies, 
and the giants made a brave, but futile last stand. 
Casting the room in darkness, Nardarik killed each 
giant, slowly, in turn. Now, only their bony car-
casses remain, along with the devastation wrought 
by Nardarik.
Searching the debris thoroughly takes 2 hours, 
but PCs succeeding at a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) 
check can determine that the bone fragments from 
the detritus resulted from the decay of a number of 
giant-sized creatures. Portions of these bones are 
pitted, twisted, or melted, as though acid had been 
thrown upon them. PCs studying the bones must 
succeed at a DC 16 Intelligence (Nature) check to 
ascertain they come from seven different hill giants.
A DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check made 
here also reveals that behind the debris, portions 
of the western wall are scarred and damaged, as 
though by acid.
Encounter Condition: [Deep Darkness], 
Echoes 4, Fog
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There is nothing of value in this hall, as 
Nardarik stripped the giants of any treasure they 
carried, including their weapons. PCs taking at 
least 20 minutes to search this room uncover large 
pieces of wood, broken iron nails, the dried remains 
of pine branches, and large-but-rotted animal pelts. 
These broken and useless materials framed at least 
ten very wide bunk beds.
Scaling: N/A
C71 . SECOND MARKED ROOM
The westernmost secret door is discovered with a suc-
cessful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The panel 
is simple and made from the same damaged stone as 
the walls. A narrow groove allows the PCs to grip the 
panel and pull it open. This action requires a DC 15 
Strength check.
The floor and walls of this chamber are heavily 
damaged. The stone surfaces are uneven and 
marked with unfamiliar patterns.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Like Room C69, a strong acid heavily 
damaged the walls and floor of this chamber. These 
cryptic marks are a warning to trespassers. A suc-
cessful DC 12 Intelligence check confirms the sub-
stance used to burn and melt the stone was acid.

C72 . HALL OF RUBBLE
A massive pile of stone rubble dominates this great 
hall. Boulders and chunks of broken rocks, all 
neatly put together in the center of the area, form a 
mound almost as tall as the 50-ft high ceiling.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Though the PCs can step into this room, 
it is extremely difficult to move inside it, due to 
the stone rubble scattered everywhere. PCs staying 
close to the walls can make their way around the 
hall, circling the mound, the summit of which is 
roughly in the center of the room. Once rubble has 
fallen, the PCs may move safely.
Encounter Condition: [Fog 10], Hazardous Footing 
16, Tremors 19
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs spend 2 hours searching through 
the rubble, they find several bone fragments 
(scarred by acid), a small pile of copper slag, and a 
bag of holding (although the sack looks like any oth-
er, only undamaged). It does not radiate magic.
After 3 hours, allow the PCs a DC 21 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check to discover a dragon slayer dagger 
(magical +1 dagger, deals an additional 3d6 damage 
against dragons). Nardarik could not destroy it, so 
he buried it under a massive pile of rubble.
Scaling: N/A
C73 . TRAPPED HALLWAY
The secret door on the northern end of the corridor 
is easy to spot. The grooves surrounding the stone 
panel are larger than most and there are obvious 
markings (wide scuffs) on the floor around it that 
disappear under the secret panel. A DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check is enough to spot these, and a sub-
sequent DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check is required 
to uncover the hidden button to the east of the panel. 
Pushing this button causes the panel to slide through 
the western wall, disappearing completely.
The westernmost part of the south wall of this 
60-ft.-high corridor is significantly damaged. The 
stone is broken and several piles of rubble lay 
scattered upon the floor, as though some powerful 
force had struck the wall. On the far end of the 
hallway, a single wooden lever juts from the stone.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: At the end of the hallway is a lever (that 
does nothing). It is designed to get someone to 
walk down the hallway. Two rounds after the secret 
door is opened, a potent magical trap is triggered. 
The magic affects the entire length of the corridor, 
from either side of the secret panel. PCs succeeding 
at a DC 19 Wisdom (Perception) check can find a 
tiny locking mechanism beside the secret door-
way. This lock can be picked with a DC 21 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools) check to safely bypass the trap.
When triggered, the trap remains active for 7 
rounds. On the first round, the reverse gravity sends 
all creatures and objects hurling toward the ceil-
ing. Creatures take 6d6 falling damage when they 
hit the 60-ft.-high ceiling. When the spell ends, 7 
rounds later, they fall to the ground as the reverse 
gravity effect ends, taking damage again. A DC 
16 Dexterity save for each fall reduces the dam-
age to half.
 '

C74 . MIMIC'S CHAMBER
This wide hall is vacant except for massive wooden 
shelves dominating the entire northern wall. The 
shelves are filled with vials, leather bound books, 
yellowed scrolls, clay pots, and silvery urns.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A mimic, fearful of Nardarik, remains in 
the form of a large bookshelf filled with trinkets 
to attract anyone foolish enough to enter. It lies 
in wait, ready to attack intruders. Having suffered 
years of torment at Nardarik’s hand, it is eager 
to vent its rage upon those who violate its lair. 

252

It attacks the PCs when someone steps within 5 
ft. of it.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Fearless, 
Poor Footing 4
Tactics: The mimic exudes a thick adhesive, hoping 
to grapple its prey or catch their weapons. Though 
angry, this creature fights intelligently and when 
given the chance, it concentrates its attacks upon 
less-armored opponents.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one mimic. To decrease the challenge, give the 
PCs an opportunity to spot the mimic.
C75 . FALSE DRAGON'S HOARD
This cross-shaped hall is filled with coins of all 
shapes and sizes. Upon the mounds of copper, gold, 
and silver are crystal candelabras, golden plates, 
silver cutlery, ivory cups, and multiple brightly 
colored jewels.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Nardarik is a covetous creature, with no 
understanding of his true lineage. His reptilian 
mind understands two things: “this is mine” and 
“how do I get more?” Therefore, to protect his 
valuables from gnolls, giants, and whatever beasts 
are too stupid to stay away, he built a false trea-
sure hoard.
The entire room is blanketed with a permanent 
illusional image (DC 20 Intelligence save) making 
visitors believe the room holds incredible treasures. 
PCs rolling a natural ‘1’ on their saves see whatever 
they most desire in the hoard (weapons, power, 
etc.). In reality, the illusion hides a pit trap covering 
most of the floor. Only those who see through the 
illusion can search for the trap (otherwise all search 
checks automatically fail). Anyone stepping on the 
floor triggers the mechanism, which opens a pit 
trap 2 rounds later.
 '
Wide-Mouth Pit Trap. Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 17 Dexterity; Characters in the 
room DC 15 Dexterity save or fall 100 ft. and take 
10d6 bludgeoning damage each.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There is nothing of value here, as the trea-
sure is just an illusion.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the depth of the wide-mouth pit trap 
to 150 ft. To decrease the challenge, reduce the 
depth to 60 ft.
C76 . GELATINOUS CUBE GUARDIAN
This hallway is completely dark. Like many other 
rooms in this region, the walls are scarred with 
scuffs and narrow markings, as though something 
was dragged across them.
There is a large cube made of bluish translucent 
gelatin in the middle of this hallway. Inside this 
weird cube is a wooden chest reinforced with 
golden brackets. The chest appears undamaged.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A huge gelatinous cube, born from the 
chaotic magic of Arum’s fractured intellect, has 

253
253
grown to enormous strength. It guards the hall-
way running around the Nardarik’s nests (Room 
C77), with a mimic posing as a treasure chest. The 
mimic’s acid immunity renders it invulnerable to 
the cube’s touch.
These creatures were already here when Nardar-
ik took control of the section and, seeing no need 
to destroy them, the dragon kept them alive for use 
as sentries. The gelatinous cube and mimic remain 
close to the door in the northern stretch of the 
corridor, but can appear anywhere in the room the 
GM wishes.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, [Fear 14], Fearless
Tactics: Should the cube suffer 50 or more points 
of damage, the mimic springs to life and attacks 
the PCs, surprising them (even if they are already 
engaged in combat) unless they succeed at a DC 25 
Wisdom (Perception) check.
The cube attacks mindlessly, engulfing the first 
PC it can. If the cube is successful, the mimic at-
tacks the PC from inside the cube, rather than wait-
ing for an opening. PCs witnessing such an attack 
must succeed at a DC 12 Wisdom save or become 
stunned for 2d4 rounds.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have there be two mimics inside the cube, each 
shaped like treasure chests or desks. To decrease 
the challenge, have the mimic surprise the PCs only 
after the cube suffers 60 points of damage.
C77. Nardarik's Nest
If Nardarik hears the PCs coming (highly likely), the 
room is already cast in darkness. Otherwise, read the 
following.
A great mound of copper, silver, and gold coins take 
up most of the floor space of this vast chamber. 
Among the coins are multiple pieces of jewelry, 
such as necklaces, rings, and bracelets, as well as 
a handful of tapestries, goblets, and utensils. What 
truly catches the eye, however, is the large dragon 
sitting atop his treasure. The creature’s scales 
are deep black, bearing several scars, and shaped 
like jagged diamonds. Fire burns within the pits 
of its eyes.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Nardarik lives here. Though he frequently 
patrols his own territory, he is found here most of 
the time. Like most of his peers, Nardarik is clever, 
cruel, and malevolent. He sees the PCs’ presence 
in his private realm as an affront to his power and 
does not hesitate to attack anyone entering its nest.
In order to negotiate with Nardarik, the PCs 
must first be able to change his initial attitude 
through the use of Charisma (Persuasion) or Cha-
risma (Deception) checks. Unless the PCs tempt 
Nardarik by promising great riches to the black 
dragon, they suffer from a -4 penalty to all Charis-
ma (Persuasion) checks made to change its attitude. 
If the PCs successfully change the dragon’s mind, it 
listens to what they have to offer hoping to acquire 
treasure from them. If the PCs fail to pay at least 
2,000 gp worth of treasure to Nardarik, com-
bat ensues.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), [Deep 
Darkness], Fearless, Fog 10, Smoke
Tactics: In battle, Nardarik is merciless. If he hasn’t 
already done so, he casts the room into darkness, 
unless the PCs surprise him, in which case he starts 
fighting immediately. Before engaging in melee, 
he uses his line of acid breath (60 ft.), targeting 
spellcasters. Due to his ferocious nature, he does 
not breathe acid as often as he can, repeating this 
action every 1d4+1 rounds.
Once engaged in melee, Nardarik tears into the 
PCs with claw and bite attacks. If too many PCs 
surround him, he tail slaps the largest, reducing his 
opponent’s numbers before returning to his breath 
weapon and claw attacks.
Due to the size of the room, Nardarik keeps his 
distance when necessary and jumps about for a 
better position whenever possible. In the darkness, 
he attacks like a cat, attacking powerful PCs before 
slinking away to stalk them again.
If the PCs are too strong for Nardarik, he uses 
darkness and his powerful breath weapon to escape 
to Room C72.
Treasure: Nardarik‘s treasure hoard includes 8,500 gp 
worth of small gemstones, assorted coins, and var-
ious pieces of jewelry. In a locked (DC 22 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools) check) wooden chest are a number 

254
254
of unmarked vials. A potion of bless and three po-
tions of healing can be found.
In another locked (DC 22 Dexterity (Thieves’ 
Tools) check) chest, strapped closed with bands of 
cold iron, the PCs find one large delicate jade Bowl 
of Commanding Water Elementals, a small lacquer 
box (wrapped in silk) containing brushes and Mar-
velous Pigments, a dark blue Ioun stone, a clear Ioun 
stone, a plain-looking ring of evasion, a ring of three 
wishes (with 0 wishes remaining), a ring of resistance 
( fire) (with a faceted fire opal set in a three-part 
crown), and an amulet of health that only fits small 
or smaller creatures.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give Nardarik an additional Legendary Action. To 
decrease the challenge, allow the PCs two rounds 
before Nardarik notices them.
C78 . CONVERTED HALL
This oddly shaped hall was probably two rooms 
once, but there are now wide gaps in the east and 
south walls, which open into the second part of it. 
Though there is nothing special here, the walls and 
floor bear many scars. The horizontal scarring of 
the walls suggests that something was dragged up 
them, and it is obvious that the floor was scarred 
with claws or sharp tools.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This hall was once two separate cham-
bers, but the doors, and indeed the entire doorways 
that separated them were destroyed long ago. The 
oversized archways are scorched and a good portion 
of the stone walls surrounding them has melted 
under the effect of an acidic substance.
The secret door in the southernmost portion of 
the east wall is a simple stone panel that has seen 
much use in recent years. Because of this, it is easy 
to discern its discolored shade and the large marks 
around it. A successful DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) 
check is enough to notice it. When pushed, the 
panel opens into the narrow corridor and wide 
chamber beyond.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: After the PCs spend 30 minutes in this room, 
roll for a random encounter. On a 6-14, a gray ooze 
or ochre jelly shuffles into the room.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
a gray ooze is already here, dissolving the stone. To 
decrease the challenge, remove the possibility of a 
Random Encounter.
C79 . GRAY OOZE PRISON
The narrow hallway opens into a wide room. This 
dark chamber is empty except for a puddle of water 
in the northeastern corner.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Nardarik keeps a gray ooze prisoner in 
this room. This creature unwittingly ventured into 
the black dragon’s lair over a year ago and now 
Nardarik frequently visits the ooze to torment it. 
The ooze remains motionless and does not attack 
unless the PCs move within 5 ft., striking the clos-
est target.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Cover
Tactics: The gray ooze does its best to conceal itself, 
hiding under cover when possible and generally 
avoiding outright confrontation. While mindless, 
months of torture have taught it to lie still and not 
attract unwanted attention.
If combat is inevitable, unarmored PCs are per-
fect targets, suffering the gray ooze’s acidic touch.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one gray ooze. To decrease the challenge, 
have the ooze recently tortured by Nardarik (-20 
hit points).

C80-C85 . TRICKS AND TRAPS .
Once serving as powerful prisons for demons and the 
like, these rooms fell out of favor when the celestials 
were forced into Regions E and G. Each room in this 
section is trapped with powerful magic, capable of 
bringing the strongest PC to his knees. For thousands 
of years, these rooms have stood as cells, holding 
pens, and “torture” chambers to remind evil creatures 
of the price of disobedience.
Since the area is devoid of inhabitants, and filled 
with traps that discourage travel, Nardarik (Room 
C77) makes no challenge to annex this territory. Most 
inhabitants of the region know about this section and 
avoid it at all costs, leaving the dragon to focus his 
energies elsewhere. The stone floor is covered with 
a thick layer of undisturbed dust, suggesting that 
nothing has entered here in some time. There are no 
random encounters in this section.
C80 . THE WEARINESS OF THE TRAVELER
This room would be perfectly square if it were not 
for a thin wall separating it into two sections. 
Though this wall seems out of place, its surface is 
exactly like the other stone walls in the area. The 
only difference is that it is narrower than what 
would be expected.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is rigged with a potent magi-
cal device that causes a level of exhaustion to those 
journeying through it. Anyone traveling through 
this room, in either direction, falls under its effect. 
Merely entering the room through one door is not 
enough to trigger the enchantment, but PCs enter-
ing the room from one door and exiting through 
the other instantly become Exhausted. This effect 
takes place regardless of the amount of time spent 
inside the room. There is no save and the condition 
persists for 24 hours.
Encounter Condition: [Fear 16], Haunted, Nega-
tive Energy
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add fear to the exhaustion effect. To decrease the 
challenge, allow each PC a DC 16 Wisdom save to 
avoid exhaustion.
C81 . THE BURDEN OF THE WEAK
The floor in this room is covered in a layer of thick 
dust and dirt. With the exception of the seven 
burning torches set upon the eastern wall, the place 
is completely empty. A beautiful sigil crisscrosses 
the stone pattern of the floor, forming an ellipse 
with intersecting circles.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is trapped with a permanent 
symbol (stunning) spell that affects anyone who steps 
on or reads the symbol printed on the center of 
the floor.
If the symbol is touched or read, everyone in 
the room must make a DC 16 Wisdom save or be 
stunned for 1 minute. Anyone who exits the room 
must save again upon re-entering the chamber and 
viewing the symbol.
 '
Symbol of Stunning Trap. Detect: DC 22 Intelligence 
(Arcana); Disable: DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana)
Encounter Condition: [Fear 18]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a symbol (pain) to the symbol of stunning. To 
decrease the challenge, replace the symbol (stunning) 
with symbol (sleep).

C82 . THE STAGGERING STRENGTH
The floor of this room is covered with dust, but 
this substance is darker than most of the dust 
blanketing the other chambers and hallways of 
this region.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: 1 round after the PCs enter this room, a 
powerful gust of wind erupts from tiny cracks in the 
floor. The gust of wind affects everyone in the room 
and sends poisonous ungol dust into the air. Living 
creatures inhaling the dust begin choking immedi-
ately and must succeed at a DC 14 Wisdom save or 
become frightened for 2d6 rounds.
 '
Gust of Wind and Ungol Dust Trap. Detect: DC 18 
Intelligence (Arcana); Disable: DC 18 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools).
Encounter Condition: [Drafty], [Fear 16], Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add chain lightning to the gust of wind and ungol 
dust trap. To decrease the challenge, remove the 
ungol dust and instead have the PCs pelted with 
pebbles and debris (2d6 bludgeoning damage to 
each player).
C83 . THE MIRROR OF TRUTH
This small room is empty except for a large mirror 
mounted on the diagonal northwest wall. The 
mirror is framed in an orange copper alloy that 
reflects light nicely. It is a large but otherwise 
simple piece of furniture.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This tiny chamber is actually a portal to 
Room C84. To pass through the secret door (or even 
discover it), the PCs must face the mirror in the 
northwest corner.
Anyone entering this room must make a DC 17 
Wisdom save to resist the Zone of Truth coming 
from the mirror. Those standing directly in front of 
the mirror, so as to see their reflections, trigger a 
magic mouth. Everyone in the room hears “Shelter 
and comfort await friends who wish it. What is your 
name?” To everyone else, the mirror is empty, but 
those who answer, the mirror see through to the 
other side.
On the other side of the mirror is a lush, yet 
confined room filled with two three-tiered bunk 
beds, a modest table, two chairs, and a wash- basin. 
The mirror is a doorway to Room C84.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
C84 . RESTFUL NIGHTMARE
A pair of three-level bunk beds dominates this 
small room. The beds can easily accommodate 
six medium-sized creatures and thick sheets rest 
upon them. In addition to the bunks, there are 
two small chairs, an ivory wash basin, and a large 
wooden chest.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The basin in this room is filled with cool 
fresh water. When water is taken out of it, the basin 
magically refills itself. Regardless of the quantity of 
liquid taken out of it, the basin constantly refills. 
The basin is mounted to the floor and cannot be 
moved or tipped over.
This room was designed to attract demons to 
safety, instead targeting them with a powerful 
nightmare. Any PC trying to rest here is subjected 
to the nightmare.
 '
Nightmare Trap. Detect: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Disable: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters 
resting in the room must make a DC 17 Wisdom 
save or suffer from the nightmare. Those who ut-
tered their true names in Room C83 receive person-
alized nightmares, based on events from their past. 
Those who lied (as demons are apt to, lest they give 
away their true name) suffer Disadvantage to Wis-
dom checks and saving throws for 24 hours due to 
visions of a future that is horrific and inexplicable.
Encounter Condition: [Distracting Vi-
sions], [Haunted]
Tactics: N/A

257
257
Treasure: The wooden chest contains extra blankets 
and pillows for six beds.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add phantasmal killer to the nightmare trap. To 
decrease the challenge, replace the nightmare trap 
with a crushing despair trap.
C85 . ANGELIC STATUE
The door to this room is locked. A DC 21 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools) check is required to open it.
A beautiful statue representing a large female 
humanoid with mighty wings issuing from her 
back stands in the middle of this room. Though the 
statue is cloaked with dust, it is clear her eyes are 
made of the purest emerald stones.
PCs who did not steal the emeralds are blessed when 
they leave the room and may rest here as long as 
they like (so long as the emeralds are untouched).
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is anachronistic in relation to 
the rest of the section. It looks and feels alien to 
anything else the PCs have seen so far. Evil-aligned 
PCs must succeed at a DC 14 Wisdom save or 
become frightened for 2d4 rounds after entering 
the room. While this effect is not devastating, it is 
intimidating.
The celestial angel statue in this room is made 
of the same stone as the rest of the dungeon. 
Despite the obvious valueless nature of its material, 
it is a truly impressive work of art. The emeralds 
that make its eyes are priceless and foreign to 
this world. A successful DC 21 Intelligence check 
confirms these gems are entirely unique and alien, 
fetching upwards of 10,000 gp each.
The PCs can remove the emeralds from the 
statue by prying them out with a successful DC 15 
Strength check. Three rounds after the precious 
stones are taken out, they turn into a dull black 
shape and crumble to dust. Soon after, the real 
terror begins.
First, when the gems turn to dust, the bearer 
must succeed at a DC 18 Dexterity save or swallow 
some of the dust, losing 1d8 maximum hp for 1 
week. Second, everyone in the room suffers bane 
for 2d8 days (no saving throw). Third, a beastly howl 
fills the room, chilling the PCs to the bone (eyebite). 
They are allowed a DC 18 Constitution save to 
negate the effect. Fourth, a wave of exhaustion (no 
saving throw) strikes everyone in the room.
Each trap effect triggers one after the other in 
successive rounds.
Encounter Condition: [Fear 18], Fearless, Hallowed or 
Unhallowed, Haunted or Safe, Negative Energy or 
Positive Energy
Tactics:
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the hit point reduction to 2d8. To decrease 
the challenge, reduce the duration of all effects 
to 24 hours.

C86-C94 . NARROW MAZE .
A multitude of narrow corridors make up most of this 
section. Because the outlying territory is so danger-
ous, inhabitants of the region usually avoid this area. 
Two years ago, a group of adventurers found their 
way into the dungeon and entered this region, estab-
lishing a base of operations in Rooms C86-C91. They 
passed away soon after. Signs of their passage can be 
found throughout these isolated chambers.
PCs venturing into the narrow hallways of this area 
must walk single file.
While Room C94 is technically part of Arnuk’s 
(Room C96) section, she avoids it and commands her 
sons to do the same. There are no random encoun-
ters in this section.
C86 . FORMER ADVENTURERS' CHAMBER
Though this small room was originally designed to 
hold a prisoner, the lock was destroyed long ago.
The stench of decay prevails in this room and a 
glance inside instantly reveals the source of the 
foul smell. The body of a dwarf, curled up in the 
fetal position, lies in the southwest corner. Almost 
no meat remains upon the skeletal corpse, but the 
odor of rotted flesh lingers.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Long after its original captive was gone, 
the room was used as a bed chamber. A dwarven 
male lies on a rotted blanket in this bed chamber, 
his cancerous form so diseased it doesn’t even 
attract flies.
Anyone touching or examining the dwarf ’s 
body must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution save 
or contract demon fever. Normally demon fever is 
spread through injury, but this strain is deadly even 
centuries after the demon’s fled the dungeon.
 '
Demon Fever. Incubation period of 24 hours, reduces 
the infected character’s maximum hit points by 2d6 
until the disease is cured.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (demon fever) 14, 
Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There are three old bedrolls in the cor-
ner, plus a diseased and rotted blanket on which 
the dwarf is sleeping. A successful DC 16 Wisdom 
(Perception) check reveals a leather scroll case and a 
small copper holy symbol (worth 5 gp) hidden in the 
closed skeletal fist of the dwarven corpse. The case 
contains three divine scrolls: calm emotions, freedom 
of movement, and protection from evil.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the hit point damage to 3d6. To decrease 
the challenge, return lost maximum hit points 
after 1 hour.
C87 . OLD HEARTH
A circle of blackened stone lies at the heart of this 
room, with a small pile of gray ashes in its center. 
It is obvious that this was used as a hearth where 
fire once burned, but there is no trace of wood 
anywhere in the chamber.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The adventuring band who lived here 
used this chamber as a common hall.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (demon fever) 14
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) 
check uncovers a half-burnt piece of parchment 
among the ashes. The last words of what must have 
been a long paragraph remains intact: “No one 
knew why they were brought together in the bowels 
of this forgotten place, except that they would 
be needed to turn the tide at some forthcoming 
event. Yet the priests and paladins serving Merunda 
obeyed the will of their deity.”
This parchment is part of Arum’s notes and 
anyone reading “Arum’s Journal” and succeeding at 
a DC 13 Intelligence check notices that the writing 
on the parchment is identical to that of the wizard’s 
journal in Room C52. This is another fragment of 
the accounts of the servants of Merunda who lost 
their lives fighting Ash (Room C21).
Scaling: N/A

C88 . ANCIENT STOREROOM
Five small crates and two large sacks crowd 
this chamber. Though the wood from the 
crates is rotted, some of the items they contain 
appear sound.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Before their demise, the adventurers 
dwelling here stored extra gear in this room.
The door on the west wall is hidden by an illu-
sion, making it appear like the wall. Anyone touch-
ing the “door” must succeed at a DC 16 Wisdom 
save to disbelieve the illusion. Failing this save 
means the PC is fooled by the illusion.
Those succeeding the save realize the stone wall 
is an illusion. The illusionary wall never disappears, 
but those making the save can open the door to 
Room C89. Due to the nature of the illusion, those 
who fail their save will never see it as anything 
but a wall.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (demon fever) 14
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The large sacks contain several long cords 
of rotted ropes, as well as torches, arrows, and 
bolts in similar states of decomposition. Within the 
crates, the PCs uncover the rusty end of a grappling 
hook (with a rotted cord), a well-oiled tent in sur-
prisingly good shape, a hooded lantern, seven oil 
flasks, flint and steel, and a rusted (but still useful) 
masterwork climber’s kit.
Scaling: N/A
C89 . FORMER TREASURE ROOM
In order to enter this room, PCs must first bypass the 
illusory wall in Room C88.
The rotted remains of shelving line the walls of this 
small room. Some of the shelves have fallen atop 
others, crushing whatever items were displayed on 
them in their wake. Others remain in place, but it is 
obvious that they are extremely fragile.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was once used to store the 
adventurers’ most precious treasures. When the 
surviving members of the band abandoned their 
base of operations, they took most of what was 
valuable in this room.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There are several broken glass vials, clay 
pots, and wax candles lying among the debris of the 
shelves and at first glance there is nothing of value 
here. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check 
uncovers three unbroken vials of holy water as well 
as a +1 battleaxe laying under the crushed shelves of 
the western wall. The axe’s blade is decorated with 
thick dwarven runes.
Scaling: N/A
C90 . FUNERAL CHAMBER
The only door leading to this chamber is locked but 
not trapped. A successful DC 18 Dexterity check is 
enough to unlock it.
Two stone altars are lined up on the eastern and 
western walls of this chamber and anyone entering 
the chamber sees that something rests upon each. 
Closer inspection reveals two man-sized corpses 
wrapped in gauzy layers of yellowed wool.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Inside are the bony remains of two 
human males and their gear. Sigils were paint-
ed on the wool, but the paint has faded from red 
to yellow.
Anyone touching or examining the bodies must 
succeed at a DC 14 Constitution save or contract 
demon fever.
 '
Demon Fever. Incubation period of 24 hours, reduces 
the infected character’s maximum hit points by 2d6 
until the disease is cured.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (demon fever) 14
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs searching the corpses find a master-
work battleaxe, a +2 throwing axe, a rusty, but func-
tional breastplate, a pouch containing 71 gp worth 
of assorted coins, and a small chunk of amber 
(worth 15 gp).
Each of the items is also riddled with disease 
and the GM should determine if the PCs can leave 
without making several Constitution saves.

Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the hit point damage of demon fever to 
3d6. To decrease the challenge, return lost maxi-
mum hit points after 1 hour.
C91 . EMPTY CELL
There is a lock upon the door, but it is busted and 
completely useless.
The door leading to this room has a barred window 
set into it, allowing anyone to gaze inside. The 
floor is cloaked in a thick blanket of undisturbed 
dust. A closer look reveals that the walls of this cell 
have discolored into a dull brown shade, as though 
someone or something had painted them long ago.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This prison cell has not been used in cen-
turies, but once contained a minor demon. A DC 
15 Intelligence check made here confirms the walls 
were painted with blood. The substance dried long 
ago, but its dark shade can still be seen.
Anyone touching or examining the blood must 
succeed at a DC 16 Constitution save or contract 
this powerful strain of demon fever.
 '
Demon Fever (Intense). Incubation period of 24 
hours, reduces the infected character’s maximum 
hit points by 4d6 until the disease is cured.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (demon fever) 14

Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the hit point damage of demon fever to 
5d6. To decrease the challenge, return lost maxi-
mum hit points after 1 hour.
C92 . CRUSHING WALL TRAP
This room is devoid of light or furniture, but a 
narrow pile of broken bones takes up most of the 
central area in this chamber. Crushed skeletons 
are lined up in the middle of the area, forming 
an almost straight line from north to south, as 
if connecting the two corridors opening into this 
room together.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is rigged with a deadly mecha-
nism designed to hold any creature that escaped its 
original cell. The bony remains in the center of the 
room are those of the unfortunate creatures that 
unwittingly ventured here and never escaped.
Three rounds after anyone enters this room, 
the east and west walls quickly move towards the 
center, crushing everyone within one round after 
this trap is sprung, the walls move back into their 
proper places.
A minuscule hidden switch can be found with a 
DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check upon the north 
wall just east of the archway. Pressing this switch 
prevents the trap from functioning for 10 minutes.
 '
Compacting Room Trap: Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 23 Dexterity; 3-round delay. No 
saving throw. All characters suffer 12d6 bludgeoning 
damage after 1 round.
Encounter Condition: [Deep Darkness]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) 
check is enough to notice an ivory ring on one of 
the fingerbone remains in the center of the room. 
The ring is simple, but it is ancient and undam-
aged. It fits any medium creature and is worth 
upwards of 750 gp to a collector.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the crushing wall trap’s damage to 16d6. To 
decrease the challenge, make the trap deal only 8d6 
points of damage.
C93 . IMPRISONED SPECTER
Due to the design of this room, opening either door 
is not easy. There are four different locks on each 
door. Subsequential DC 18, DC 22, DC 25, and DC 
28 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) checks are required to 
unlock them. If any check fails by 10 or more, all the 
locks reset and the PC must start over. In addition, 
each lock is trapped with a powerful ward that acti-
vates if the lock is tampered with. Each ward is ex-
tremely difficult to notice, as the tiny rune is written 
inside of the locking mechanism.
The first ward is a bestow curse trap.
 '
Bestow Curse Trap: Detect. DC 21 Intelligence (Ar-
cana); Disable: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); Charac-
ters in the room must make a DC 15 Wisdom save 

261
261
or have disadvantage on all Strength ability checks 
and saving throws for 8 hours.
The second lock is protected by a symbol (sleep).
 '
Symbol of Sleep Trap. Detect: DC 17 Intelligence (Ar-
cana); Disable: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); Charac-
ters in the room must make a DC 15 Wisdom save 
or fall asleep for 10 minutes.
The third lock is protected by symbol (stunning).
 '
Symbol of Stunning Trap. Detect: DC 21 Intelligence 
(Arcana); Disable: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); Char-
acters in the room must make a DC 17 Wisdom save 
or be stunned for 1 minute.
The fourth lock is guarded by feeblemind.
 '
Feeblemind Trap. Detect: DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Disable: DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters 
in the room suffer 4d6 psychic damage and must 
make a DC 12 Intelligence save or their Intelligence 
and Charisma scores become 1. At the end of every 
30 days, the characters can repeat the saving throw 
until they save. The effect can be ended by greater 
restoration, heal, or wish.
Opening the doors from inside this room requires 
the PCs to unlock only the last two locks, but the 
wards protecting these two are still present.
Five massive columns carved from bedrock support 
the fifty-foot-high ceiling of this great hall. Like 
most chambers in the dungeon, the area is bathed 
in shadows, but the disquieting murmurs of some 
hidden menace echoes through the wide place. 
Strange mirrors on the floor, ceiling, and walls 
reflect light in every direction, casting shadows 
into every corner and distorting the apparent size 
of the room.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This chamber holds one of the few orig-
inal inhabitants of the dungeon: a mighty specter 
named Aslur’thyn, whose cell was so secure, he 
never escaped. Magical wards upon the entire stone 
surfaces of the walls, ceiling, and floor keep him 
inside. Powerful magic imbues the walls of this spe-
cial prison cell, trapping all sound inside. This effect 
acts as silence.
Aslur’thyn has been confined to this cell since 
the dungeon was first built and has lost all hope 
of ever escaping. When the PCs open one of the 
doors leading into its cell, he stares in disbelief for 
one round. Allow him a DC 20 Wisdom save on the 
second round. If successful, he rushes for the door, 
otherwise he waits until the third round to make 
his escape.
Unless the PCs prevent Aslur’thyn from exiting 
the room, he flies past them. If the PCs stand in his 
way or attack him, Aslur’thyn fights back, vent-
ing centuries of accumulated anger. If the doors 
close, trapping him once again inside, he becomes 
furious and gains the benefit of barbarian rage for 
3 minutes.
Encounter Condition: Cursed 4, Distracting Noises, 
Distracting Visions
Tactics: Once engaged in battle, Aslur’thyn is relent-
less and fights until destroyed. He targets the weak-
est PC, drawing him away or sequestering him from 
the rest of the party. He continues to attack a single 
target until either of them is dead. If Aslur’thyn suc-
cessfully kills a PC (who will return as a spawn 1d3 
rounds later), he flees so the PCs are forced to fight 
one of their own.
If Aslur’thyn flees into the dungeon, he escapes 
via the fastest route possible, hiding from the PCs if 
they give chase. If the PCs allow him to escape, he 
immediately looks for victims to convert to spawns 
and within 24 hours commands 1d6 specters. This 
pattern continues until everything is converted 
or the specter finds an adversary more powerful 
than himself.
Aslur’thyn heads north, avoiding the dragon and 
oozes, but attacking any humanoids he finds. If the 
PCs emptied this region, he heads west in search of 
goblins in Region B before heading toward Region 
N. If the PCs chase him to Region F or G, he flies 
across the lava.
Treasure: The specter’s cloak is a black robe of the 
archmagi. The benefits of wearing this robe are 
bestowed to the wearer against corporeal and 
incorporeal creatures. If the PCs destroy Aslur’thyn 
they can take the robe, understanding that it is, of 
course, evil. The cloak is semi-incorporeal and part 
of him, but it becomes substantial when Aslur’thyn 
is destroyed.
The angels hid a powerful tome in this room, 
keeping its secrets from the world. The mirrors 
along the walls are part of the specter’s torment, 
reminding him of these trappings, no matter where 

262
262
he looks. But they also serve a second purpose. If 
the PCs succeed at a DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) 
check, they see a series of nodes on the four out-
side pillars in the mirrors that they cannot see on 
the pillars themselves. The center pillar is devoid 
of these nodes. Clever PCs should note that this 
means something, but a DC 21 Intelligence reveals 
the nodes are part of a grand puzzle.
It takes a while for the PCs to study the nodes 
and note subtle differences in their shape and 
color. After an hour, allow the PCs a DC 21 Wisdom 
(Perception) check to confirm the four nodes that 
are identical. If the PCs can find a way to touch 
them all at the same time (they are all placed in 
such a way that no two can be touched at once by 
a large or smaller being), the center pillar slowly 
opens from top to bottom like a giant puzzle box. 
As each stone shifts, more and more light from the 
pillar’s core releases until 5 minutes later the room 
is bathed in daylight.
Once the pillar is completely opened (a process 
that takes 30 minutes), a small pedestal remains, 
with a book resting on it. This process also disables 
the traps on the locks, until the pillars are reset by 
pressing the nodes again (which closes the pillar). 
The book is shielded by great magic and any PC 
touching it sets off a divine word trap which resets 
in 5 rounds.
 '
Divine Word Trap. Detect: DC 17 Intelligence (Ar-
cana); Disable: DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana); Char-
acters touching the book must succeed on a DC 17 
Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature 
is deafened for 1 minute. On a 15, the creature is 
deafened and blinded for 10 minutes. On a 10 the 
creature is blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 
hour. On a 5 or lower, the creature is killed instant-
ly. Celestials, elementals, fey, or fiends that fail are 
forced back to their plane of origin and cannot 
return for 24 hours.
If the PCs find a way to bypass the divine word 
trap, they can take the book, which is in fact, a vile 
tome containing every arcane necromancy spell 
ever written. Every necromancy spell from the 
wizard, sorcerer, or cleric spell lists in the Player’s 
Handbook is here. It is up to the GM if these spells 
are from other open source material or just so 
powerful and incomprehensible the PCs can never 
learn them. The book radiates strong Necromancy 
and evil. If they do not disable the divine word trap, 
the book can only be removed from the pedestal by 
a lawful good character.
In addition, the surface of the book is protect-
ed by a glyph of warding, which goes off once the 
PCs read the cover. If they open the book to the 
first page, the character must succeed on a DC 17 
Dexterity saving throw, or a magical snake leaps out 
and sinks its teeth into the character, and vanish-
es. The character suffers 6d8 poison damage and 
must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On 
a failure, the damage reduces their maximum hit 
points by an amount equal to the damage taken for 
24 hours. Neither effect can be dispelled or disabled 
and neither harm the book.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a specter or wight, neither of which wants to 
leave but instead intends to convert the PCs into 
the undead. In addition, they can use ‘life drain’ on 
animals as well as humanoids. To decrease the chal-
lenge, place daylight in the center of the room in a 
20-ft. radius that affects Alsur’thyn as sunlight.
C94 . CRUSHING GRATE TRAP
The floor of this great hall is arranged with a 
multitude of square tiles. Gray dust covers most of 
the floor, but it fails to hide the dented and chipped 
stone surface. Within each of the cracks separating 
the floor tiles, caked blood can be seen.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The floor of this chamber is rigged with 
countless pressure plates. Each 5-ft.-by-5-ft. stone 
square making up the floor of the hall is part of a 
deadly mechanism that sends a heavy stone grate to 
the ground. This grate is made of the same stone as 
the rest of the region, is as large as the room, and 
is supported from the ceiling by massive iron poles. 
When more than 50 lbs. are put upon one of the 
pressure plates, the grate descends to the floor and 
crushes everyone inside.
When not activated, the grate looks like it is part of 
the ceiling. The only differences being that there are 
a multitude of small holes (some six inches in di-
ameter) cutting through its surface and dried blood 
is all over it. It can be spotted with a successful DC 
16 Wisdom (Perception) check, which also alerts 
anyone proficient with Thieves’ Tools of the danger.

C95-C102 . HILL GIANTS' LAIR
This section is the home of Arnuk, a hill giant cleric, 
and her two sons. Arnuk’s family was part of a tribe 
that once dominated a large section of this region. 
But when Nardarik (Room C77) came, he killed off 
most of the tribe and drove the survivors away. Arnuk 
and her sons are the only remaining hill giants from 
this once-proud tribe.
To make matters worse, Vernir, one of Arnuk‘s sons, 
once made a deal with the king of the goblins (Room 
B75) to fight the wizard Arum for them. Even in his 
maddened state, Arum was too much for the giant 
and Vernir nearly lost his life. Fortunately, the wizard 
showed mercy and only trapped the giant behind 
several layers of stony walls, rather than kill him. 
Arnuk and her other son now bear a deep grudge, but 
are unaware that Arum is gone. Lastly, the giants no 
longer trust the goblins and seek vengeance, should 
they ever find a way to escape.
Though they are content with their existence, these 
hill giants are trapped in the region and have little 
hope of ever emerging from the dungeon. They do 
not know about the secret door in Room C61, nor 
can they get past the imprisoned specter (Room C93). 
If they ever escape, Arnuk plans to destroy the black 
dragon Nardarik (Rooms C69-C79), the entire goblin 
tribe (Region B), and Arum.
Unless the PCs are Hostile, Arnuk asks them to do 
her bidding by talking about the great riches stolen 
from her people by the evil dragon Nardarik, as well 
as the treachery of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. If the 
PCs agree to help Arnuk get rid of her enemies, they 
are welcome in her lair. If the PCs do not want any-
thing to do with the hill giants, Arnuk and her sons 
insist that they exit their private domain. If the PCs 
know a way out, they handsomely reward them and 
offer an alliance.
Due to the size of the corridors, the giants are rare-
ly found outside Room C97. Their speed is cut in half 
in these tight hallways.

C95 . PRISON CUBICLES
This room is divided into smaller sections by a 
number of walls. Though these walls are made 
from the same stone as the rest of the chamber, 
and indeed most of the dungeon, they are thinner 
and obviously designed to break the room into 
small cubicles. Within each of these cubicles, rusted 
iron chains and manacles hang from the walls.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is segmented into smaller 
alcoves where minor demons were kept in chains 
centuries ago. There are enough chains and man-
acles in this chamber to keep 14 medium creatures 
shackled. Though the chains are rusty, they remain 
solidly encased within the walls. The manacles, on 
the other hand, have all been forced open and are 
now completely useless.
The secret door on the northeastern wall is 
seldom used nowadays, but the stone is marked 
with several dents and its edges are beginning to 
crumble. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) 
check is enough to notice the stone panel, which 
can be easily pushed open.

C96 . BONE ROOM
Large bones litter the floor of this room, covering 
most of its stone surface. The bones seem old and, 
judging by the accumulated dust upon them, have 
not been disturbed in a while. Within the debris are 
several skulls, which resemble humanoid heads, 
only bigger.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Arnuk and her sons piled the remains of 
some dead hill giants here. A successful DC 15 Intel-
ligence (Nature) check confirms the bones are those 
of hill giants. Twelve corpses can be found.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: This room is filled with hill giant bones 
from Arnuk’s former tribe. A successful DC 25 
Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a golden tooth 
in a giant’s jaw. The tooth is large and made of pure 
gold (150 gp).
Scaling: N/A
C97 . BROKEN WALLS
PCs in Room C48 can hear a soft clamor of metal 
on stone, coming from the other side of the wall 
of stone. However, because the stone is so dense, 
they cannot determine that a hill giant is pounding 
away at it.
The sound of stone breaking upon stone echoes 
throughout this chamber and beyond. Inside the 
wide hall is a large giant in tattered hides. The male 
giant stands in the middle of the room, surrounded 
by massive mounds of stony rubble. One of its eyes 
is swollen shut, as though it suffered a tremendous 
blow. The creature seems hard at work, as it 
takes heavy boulders, raises them above its head, 
and throws them as hard as it can against the 
surrounding walls, which are heavily damaged from 
years of such abuse. Each time the giant throws 
a boulder, it refuses to fragment into smaller pieces.
Initial Attitude: Varies
Encounter: A small portion of the east wall is a cor-
ridor blocked with a wall of stone. A DC 18 Intel-
ligence (Arcana) check identifies it. When Arum 
fought the hill giant Vernir, he encased him in 

265
265
stone in this great hall. Though his family eventu-
ally freed him, Vernir frequently visits the cham-
ber, hoping to demolish the stony remains of his 
former prison.
Vernir spends most of his time in this hall 
smashing the stone walls created by Arum. The 
rubble is from the damage Vernir dealt to the 
stonework over the years. Because Vernir is working 
and not paying attention to what goes on around 
him, he suffers from Disadvantage to any Wisdom 
(Perception) checks.
If one of the PCs is a male human spellcaster 
(in dark-colored robes), Vernir is hostile and at-
tacks him on sight. Otherwise, his initial attitude 
is unfriendly, as he is suspicious of humanoids. If 
the PCs talk to Vernir, the hill giant mutters “You 
should not be here. This is mother’s territory.” 
To reinforce his comment, he demands a 20 gp 
toll from each of them. If the PCs pay the toll, or 
if they convince Vernir they mean no harm, he 
brings them to his mother in Room C98. If the PCs 
promise to leave the hill giant’s domain, Vernir still 
insists they pay the toll.
Encounter Condition: Cover, Echoes 5
Tactics: If there is a battle here, Vernir’s mother 
and brother do not come to his aid. Both giants 
are accustomed to the constant din of breaking 
boulders and crashing rocks. Unless the PCs make 
some kind of unusual noise the other hill giants 
remain in place.
In combat, Vernir takes cover behind a stone pile 
and throws boulders at the party. He targets the 
spellcasters first. If forced into melee, he handles 
the enemies within his reach, using his massive 
steel maul.
Treasure: Vernir carries a pouch with 11 bloodstones, 
worth 20 gp each.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a damage die to each of Vernir’s attacks. To 
decrease the challenge, Vernir becomes Frightened 
when a PC casts an offensive spell at him or uses 
magic to do anything “obvious.”
C98 . HILL GIANT SHRINE
If the PCs make any noise or use a light source in the 
corridor leading to this chamber, Arnuk automatically 
notices them.
A stone altar dominates this chamber. Upon the 
altar is a pair of human skulls inside of which 
yellow candles are set. The candles burn with a 
pale golden light, illuminating portions of the 
room. Behind the altar is a giant female. Her long, 
disheveled hair is tangled with small bones and 
a scorched human skull hangs from a thick gold 
chain around her neck.

266
266
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Arnuk built a crude shrine to her deity 
in this wide chamber, and the hill giant priestess 
spends most of her recreational time here. Unless 
the PCs have harmed one of her sons or they attack 
her immediately, Arnuk is more than willing to 
negotiate. She is especially interested in the drag-
on’s hoard (Room C75) and killing the black drag-
on guarding it. If the PCs appear interested, she 
reveals where it is and even warns them about the 
deadly creature in Room C76 and the trap in Room 
C94. She does not know Room C75 is a false hoard.
If the PCs offend her god or harmed one of her 
sons, Arnuk attacks immediately.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If battle ensues, Arnuk casts divine favor on 
herself followed by shield of faith. She then pro-
ceeds to cast an offensive spell to harm or hamper 
the PCs, targeting the warriors of the party first. 
Since she has a 10 ft. reach, she keeps the PCs at 
bay for a round or two, at least, before using her 
magical mace to crush her enemies. She continues 
to cast spells when not engaged directly with two 
or more PCs.
Arnuk utters loud cries and curses while com-
bating the PCs, which automatically alerts her son 
Mourgir (Room C101). Mourgir comes to defend 
his mother 1d3 rounds later.
Treasure: In addition to the magical items Arnuk 
carries, she also has a pouch with 79 pp, 51 gp, and 
19 sp, as well as three glass vials of unholy water. The 
unholy symbol upon her neck is made from a paint-
ed human skull and worth upwards of 25 gp to any 
follower of the faith. The golden chain upon which 
it is set is also worth 25 gp.
Scaling: To decrease the challenge, take away Arnuk’s 
warhammer.
C99 . VERNIR'S CHAMBER
A massive bed made of broken logs, crushed tree 
branches, and dried leaves occupies most of the 
floor area of this room. The crude bed is covered 
with tattered animal pelts and is large enough to 
accommodate a pair of giants. Beside it are several 
perfectly round rocks.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is the private bedchamber 
of Vernir, Arnuk’s youngest son. Vernir uses this 
chamber to rest, but spends most of his time in 
Room C97 . Since he does not trust Mourgir (Room 
C101), he carries his bloodstones with him, leaving 
only battered skins on his bed.
If the PCs make noise, Arnuk (in Room C98) 
automatically hears them and investigates 1 round 
later. Also allow Mourgir the appropriate Wisdom 
(Perception) check to notice the PCs. If he hears 
them, Mourgir arrives in 1d3 rounds.

C100 . ARNUK'S CHAMBER
Four old beds are arranged in the middle of this 
room, taking up most of the floor. The beds are 
lined up against one another and a thick layer of 
animal skins covers them. On top of the pelts is a 
human skull, neatly placed at the exact center of 
the four beds.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This is Arnuk‘s private abode and she 
does not tolerate anyone coming into her bedroom. 
Although she is only here when she rests, the room 
is close enough to her shrine that she can keep an 
eye on it. She investigates 1 round later and does 
not hesitate to attack would-be thieves. Allow Mour-
gir (Room C101) the appropriate Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check to notice the PCs. If he does, the hill 
giant comes out of his bedchamber and arrives here 
1d3 rounds thereafter.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) 
check reveals a wooden coffer tucked under a bed. 
This chest is unlocked and contains various robes 
fashioned for a giant as well as a total of 541 gp 
worth of assorted coins and gems, a well-wrought 
sapphire (worth 500 gp), and a wand of mag-
ic missiles.
Scaling: N/A

C101 . MOURGIR'S CHAMBER
A large pile of crushed stone rubble covered 
with broken twigs and branches dominates the 
northern area of this room. A dark-haired giant 
dressed in hide armor sits atop the uncomfortable-
looking bed.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This is the private bedroom of Mourgir, 
Arnuk’s eldest son. Though the hill giant sometimes 
patrols his mother’s domain, he spends most of his 
time in this chamber, dreaming about the fresh air 
of his mountain home. For such a savage crea-
ture, he is (at times), noticeably sensitive. As such, 
his mother is more protective of him than Vernir 
(Room C97).
Although suspicious, Mourgir is curious about 
the PCs and eager to talk with them. He is especial-
ly interested in tales of the open country and the 
mountains surrounding the dungeon. If the PCs 
are friendly and tell stories, his attitude automat-
ically shifts to friendly. If, on the other hand, they 
harmed his brother or mother, or if they tried to 
steal from Room C102, Mourgir does not hesitate 
and attacks.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: Mourgir does not throw rocks, preferring 
instead to charge the strongest warriors and en-
gage in melee. He fights until his hit point total 
is reduced to 25 or less, at which point he flees for 
Room C98. If combat breaks out here, Arnuk (in 
Room C98) arrives 1d3 rounds later.
Treasure: Mourgir wears a large necklace made of 
carved bone fragments (worth 20 gp) and carries a 
pouch with 97 gp worth of small gemstones.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a damage die to each of Mourgir’s attacks. To 
decrease the challenge, have him frazzled by a re-
cent argument with his brother, and thus suffering 
from the effects of bane.
C102 . HILL GIANTS' STOREROOM
A rounded, flat boulder blocks the only entrance 
leading to this room, which is used by the giants to 
store the various goods they found in the dungeon. A 
successful DC 22 Strength check is required to move 
the boulder in front of the door. This action, however, 
automatically alerts Mourgir that someone is trying 
to enter the store. Since he is in charge of it, the giant 
comes out of his chamber (Room C101) to investigate 
1 round later. If Mourgir engages the PCs in battle, 
his mother (in Room C98) joins the fray 1d3 rounds 
after combat begins.
Three piles of round rocks and a wide mound of 
broken bones take up most of this room, which is 
used for storage. Upon the southernmost wall is a 
collection of weapons and other gear. Trinkets lie in 
an untidy pile near this equipment.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: There are piles of boulders here, as 
well as skull trophies and the like. The body of an 
adventurer can be found among the debris as well, 
stripped of its gear and left to rot. Fiendish GMs 
can make the adventurer a familiar face from one of 
the PCs’ past.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Along the south wall are three large great-
clubs, a rusty greatsword, two disheveled halberds, 
an ornate masterwork falchion, a medium suit of 
masterwork full plate armor, a +2 large steel shield, 
three coils of 50-ft.-long hempen rope, two empty 
backpacks, and a small wooden box containing 16 
wax candles.

C103-C105 . THE KEY
The doors of this section of the dungeon have not 
been breached since the angel wardens abandoned 
it. Built within the vast prison complex, this area was 
used to store an important key. This special key opens 
the door in Room B21 (and thus gives access to Re-
gion F). It can be found in Room C105, but can only 
be handled by PCs bearing the Mark of the Righteous 
(see Room C21), as it is an animated object; attacking 
anyone not bearing the Mark who touches it.
To complicate things, the angel builders of the 
dungeon designed a false key (in Room C103) as well 
as a series of six interconnected rooms (C104) made 
to deceive would-be robbers.
There are no random encounters in this section.
C103 . THE FALSE KEY
Both doors leading into this room are locked. Anyone 
succeeding at a DC 23 Dexterity check unlocks them.
The walls of this room are beautifully painted. 
The pictures depict various angels performing 
blissful tasks. Some hold weapons and stand at 
attention. Others are sculpting great works of 
art or designing tall buildings. Though thick dust 
covers the floor of this room, its painted walls 
are surprisingly clean. What truly catches one’s 
attention, however, is the glowing silvery key 
resting upon a simple stone altar in the southern 
nook of the chamber.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The only purpose of this room is to 
deceive others into believing a false key is the key 
needed to unlock the door in Room B21. Unlike the 
keys found in Room C104, this false key is a perfect 
replica of the one fitting into the lock of Room B21. 
When inserted into this lock, however, a powerful 
sonic blast is triggered and the fake key melts into 
the mechanism, preventing anyone from unlock-
ing the door.
Anyone with the Mark of the Righteous (see 
Room C21) is allowed a DC 15 Intelligence save to 
learn this key is a fake.
The secret panel upon the south wall is impos-
sible to notice or open by normal means. A PC with 
the Mark of the Righteous is automatically made 
aware of the secret door and only needs to touch 
it to watch the panel sink into the floor. The secret 
doorway remains open for as long as someone with 
the Mark of the Righteous stands within Room 
C103 or the adjacent Room C104.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The only treasure in this room is the false 
special key upon the altar.
Scaling: N/A
C104 . RIGGED FALSE KEYS
The only door leading into these six interconnected 
rooms is locked. A PC succeeding at a DC 21 Dexter-
ity check unlocks it. Each of these rooms holds 20 
different keys, hanging at varying heights from the 
ceiling on strands of wire above a simple stone altar. 
The keys vary in size, shape, and color. Each is made 
from a unique material.
A small altar lies in the middle of the south wall. 
Hanging from the ceiling are several keys of various 
sizes, shapes, and materials. Some are made of 
silver, gold, bronze, copper or steel. Some of wood, 
granite, ivory, colored glass, semi-precious stone, 
and alien material you’ve never seen before.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These six chambers hold a total of 120 
false keys (20 per room) made to confuse, hamper, 
or harm trespassers. Each key is different. Some 
are trapped, while others are mere trinkets serving 
no real purpose. Every time a PC picks up one of 
the keys, roll on the following table to determine 
its effect:

This key looks like the perfect key for the task at hand. The wielder must succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom 
save or believe he carries the true key.
9
This key is made of glass and reflects light like a prism. The wielder believes he gains true seeing 
from it, but instead cannot lie while holding the key.
10This key makes everyone else appear invisible when held.
11
This key projects legend lore in the mind of the wielder, reciting the entire history of the dungeons. 
It takes 100 years to watch the entire vision, but the PC is allowed a DC 15 Wisdom save each day to 
stop watching.
12
This key is cursed and a trap is triggered when the key is touched. The curse continues as long as 
the key is held and for 10 hours after.
 '
Bestow Curse Trap. Detect: DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters holding the key must make a DC 
13 Wisdom save or have disadvantage on all Charisma ability checks and saving throws.
13
This key releases a potent thunderous discharge.
 '
Thunderwave Trap. Detect: DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters holding the key must make a DC 
15 Constitution save for half damage or suffer 4d8 thunder damage.
14
This key is coated with poison.
 '
Key Smeared With Poison Trap. Detect: DC 17 Wisdom (Perception); Characters holding the key must 
make a DC 15 Constitution save for half damage or suffer 4d6 poison damage.
15
This key grants the wielder water breathing, but the inability to breathe air. A DC 15 Wisdom save is 
required to drop the key. Only one save is allowed per day.
16
This key turns the wielder’s hand incorporeal, allowing him to only touch the key and incorporeal 
creatures. A DC 16 Wisdom save is required to drop the key. Only one save is allowed per day.
17This key alerts all lawful and good creatures in a 500-ft. radius of the wielder’s presence.
18
This key can open any one mundane lock, but drains the wielder of 1 hit point (permanently) after 
doing so. Afterwards, it turns to fine sand.
19
This key casts disintegrate when touched. A DC 15 Dexterity save is required or suffer 10d6+40 force 
damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the character turns to dust.
20
This key radiates strong magic. It bestows a curse on the bearer, who can only get rid of it with a 
wish, or similar spell-like effect. The curse is up to the GM but should minor, like stumpy fingers or 
constant dry mouth.

272
272
All keys (except 20) radiate strong Abjuration and 
Evocation. A PC with the Mark of the Righteous (see 
room C21) is allowed a DC 16 Wisdom save in each of 
these six rooms to determine all 20 keys are useless.
If at least one PC already has the Mark of the 
Righteous, he is instantly made aware of the secret 
doorway in the north wall in the easternmost room. A 
PC with the Mark touching the panel watches it sink 
into the floor.
Otherwise, this secret door is impossible to see.
C105 . TEST OF CHARITY
The door of this room opens when the PCs step into 
Room C104, but remains open only for 5 rounds. PCs 
need to succeed at the Test of Humility in order to 
discover this door. However, this secret panel also 
shuts as soon as one person enters this room. It is 
impossible to open once it is closed, but PCs on ei-
ther side succeeding at a DC 28 Dexterity (Acrobatics) 
check can move in or out of the room before the door 
closes. The door opens by itself once a PC selects an 
item from one of the cubby-holes.
There are three items in the cubby-holes against 
the northern wall of this otherwise empty room: 
a chest filled with gold pieces, a beautiful golden 
rose, and an intricate sword with a strange runic 
mark on it. Above the items are the words “Choose 
from the Heart”, written in silvery Celestial runes.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: In order to pass the Test of Charity, the 
PC must select an item and explain why he chose it. 
The actual item chosen by the PC is not important, 
but what they plan to do with it is.
There is no correct answer.
It is up to the GM to determine as best they can 
what motivated the PC in their selection. Charita-
ble motives include taking one of the treasures to 
offer it to another, to a faith, or a cause. If the PC 
was charitable, they pass the test. If they were not, 
they fail.
Once any item is touched, the rest disappear. 
Failing the test sends a powerful electrical dis-
charge of chain lightning through the room. All 
characters must make a Dexterity save for half dam-
age or suffer 10d8 lightning damage.
Succeeding the test results in the PC receiving 
the Mark of the Righteous (as explained in Room 
C21) and all benefits it bestows, including being 
allowed to enter Room C103.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: It is recommended that this encounter be run 
individually with each PC. The answer to each ques-
tion should not be heard by the others, to gauge 
the honesty of their remarks.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the electrical discharge to 
16d6. To decrease the challenge, reduce the dam-
age to 8d6.
C105 . THE REAL SPECIAL KEY
The secret panel leading into this room is impossible 
to see or open by normal means. A PC with the Mark 
of the Righteous is automatically made aware of this 
secret doorway. They need to touch the panel to make 
it sink into the floor. The secret door remains open 
as long as someone with the Mark of the Righteous 
stands in Room C105 or the adjacent Room C104.
An untraceable light source simulating daylight 
illuminates this chamber. The walls, floor, and 
ceiling are painted white and their surfaces are 
surprisingly clean. In the center of the room is a 
simple altar made from the same painted stone. 
A silver key, glowing brightly in the magical light, 
rests upon it.
Initial Attitude: Helpful or Hostile (see below)
Encounter: This room holds the real special key 
allowing the angels and archons that built the 
dungeon to move from Room B21 to Region F. The 
only way to gain access to this room is by having 
the Mark of the Righteous. Once the door opens 
for a PC with the Mark, others can accompany 
them inside.
The silvery key on the altar is a special animated 
object. When picked by someone with the Mark of 
the Righteous it remains inanimate, just as any oth-
er key. However, if someone without the Mark takes 
the key at any time or place, it becomes animated 
and flies around the room trying to avoid capture. 
If destroyed, the key becomes useless. Otherwise, it 

273
273
can be used to unlock the door in Room B21, thus 
giving access to Region F.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: This animated object targets creatures not 
bearing the Mark of the Righteous and never strikes 
those blessed with such a Mark. It fights until de-
stroyed, but if a full round elapses without anyone 
trying to strike it, it ceases to attack and falls prone 
(as if it were not animated). If this happens, a PC 
with the Mark of the Righteous can pick it up. If 
someone without the Mark takes it again, however, 
it becomes animated again and flies off.
Treasure: The special key rests upon the altar. It is the 
only key that unlocks the door in Room B21.
Scaling: N/A
C106-C110 . THE FINAL MILE
Rooms C106-C110 are isolated from the rest of the 
region. Though they connect with Region G, and the 
base of the angels and celestials inhabiting this part 
of the dungeon, no creatures have graced this area in 
many years.
There are no Random Encounters in this section.
C106 . THE ANGELS' INSIGNIA
The floor of the corridor is blanketed in undisturbed 
dust. The double doors at its northern end are 
cast from solid bronze. Upon them is a design: a 
flaming sword encircled by a ring of feathers.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These corridors connect Region C and 
G together. Though there are no traps here, the 
bronze double doors in these corridors are locked. 
A successful DC 21 Dexterity check is required to 
unlock them. The insignia upon them is the symbol 
of the Order of the Children of the Inner Light, the 
group of angels and celestials in charge of protect-
ing Region G. The symbol marks the beginning of 
their territory.

C107 . TRAPPED CORRIDORS
This hallway is dusty, dark, and empty. A closer 
look at the floor reveals a rune in the center of the 
corridor. Though covered with dust, the design is 
easily spotted, as it is over 10-ft. in diameter. The 
marking represents an angel holding a wide blade, 
its feathery wings spread wide behind its back.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The corridors to the east and west of 
Room C108 are trapped. The designs upon the floor 
in each of these corridors are meant to attract the 
attention of travelers. The patterns take the entire 
width of the hallways and are at least 10 ft. long. 
Anyone stepping upon the markings or touching 
them automatically triggers the magical trap placed 
upon them. There is no way to bypass these traps, 
and creatures flying above the designs automatical-
ly trigger them.
 '
Glyph of Warding (Explosive Runes). Detect: DC 19 
Intelligence (Arcana); Disable: DC 19 Intelligence 
(Arcana); Characters in the hallway DC 14 Dexterity 
save for half damage or suffer 5d8 thunder damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the save DC of the glyph of warding trap by 
+4. To decrease the challenge, replace the glyph of 
warding trap with a burning hands trap.
C108 . INTRICATE MOSAIC
A large and perfectly round mosaic made out 
of stones of varying shapes and colors takes up 
most of the floor of this chamber. The mosaic is 
exquisitely designed and its many patterns are 
abstract and fascinating. They are somewhat 
reminiscent of the complex patterns made by the 
artisans who fashion the marvelous carpets in 
the Southern Realms, yet a thousand times more 
elaborate.
Initial Attitude: N/A

274
274
Encounter: The floor of this chamber is rigged with 
a simple but effective pit trap. A closer look at the 
mosaic reveals the colorful stones composing it are 
not attached to the floor and could be extracted 
from the pattern. Anyone touching the stones from 
the mosaic or stepping upon them automatically 
triggers the pit trap. When activated, the floor of 
the entire room opens, sending all the stones from 
the mosaic inside a deep pit.
PCs who do not disturb the mosaic can 
move safely through the room without trigger-
ing the trap.
 '
Pit Trap. Detect: DC 18 Wisdom (Perception); Dis-
able: DC 22 Dexterity; Characters in the room DC 17 
Dexterity save or fall 100 ft. and take 10d6 blud-
geoning damage each.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: At the bottom of the pit trap are bony 
remains of a dead unidentifiable creature. A golden 
armband (worth 190 gp) is attached to one of the 
bones and a +3 halberd rests under them.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add another 40 ft. to the pit trap. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the trap to 60 ft.
C109 . DISPIRITING HALL
A series of torches set 20 ft. from the floor into 
thick bronze sconces burn here. The dancing flames 
illuminate the great hall, but fail to keep the eerie 
shadows very far.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This great hall is empty but endowed with 
powerful angelic magic meant to discourage living 
creatures from venturing through it. Lawful good 
creatures are not affected by the enchantment, but 
all other living beings are, including outsiders such 
as demons.
Upon entering, all non-lawful good PCs must 
make a DC 21 Wisdom save or become disheart-
ened for one full week. A disheartened character 
suffers from a -2 morale penalty to attack rolls, 
damage rolls, AC, saves, and skill checks. A remove 
curse is not strong enough to lift this effect, but 
each one reduces the duration of the effect by 1 day.
Encounter Condition: Cursed 5, Fear 16
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: All 40 torches are imbued with con-
tinual flame.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the Wisdom save DC by +2 and add one 
week to the disheartening effect. To reduce the 
challenge, reduce the effect to 1d4 days. Alternative-
ly, it only affects non-lawful characters.
C110 . THE GATEWAY
A wide ornate archway dominates the southern 
wall of this great hall. The archway opens into a 
surprisingly vast room, but the rest of the hall is 
empty and dark. A close examination of the cloak 
of dust upon the floor here reveals that no one has 
walked here in years.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This chamber has a magical gateway that 
allows travel to Room C21, but offers no means 
of exiting.
This hall has a portal identical to the large ornate 
archway in Room C21, with the exception that the 
interior of the archway is not solid. Instead, it opens 
into Room C21, just as if the two chambers were 
connected. This is the one-way entrance into the 
prison cell where a great demon was once held 
prisoner. Any object that goes through the archway 
from Room C110 instantly comes out the other 
archway in Room C21. Inanimate objects that par-
tially pass through the portal can be retrieved, but 
anything living or organic is stuck in Room C21. 
Nothing from Room C21 can travel back through 
the portal in this hall.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the PCs lose limbs if they stick their hands 
through the portal and pull them back. To decrease 
the challenge, allow the PCs to move back and forth 
without fail, indicating the wards protecting this 
prison vanished decades ago.

Region D . The Tartarean 
Depths of the Xill Master
Chtrax is a diabolic xill of such caliber that his so-
ciety willingly cast him out to wander the planes 
for the remainder of eternity. Desperately seeking 
revenge, the xill searched for a good way to destroy 
his people outright. During his roamings, he came 
upon information which confirmed the existence of 
a malevolent, exiled god, Asrakhor the Undying, a 
terrible threat to the stability of the planes if freed. 
He understood from the depths of his madness that 
Asrakhor could help him get his revenge, but he did 
not know where to find him. All his searching yielded 
no clues, no evidence, nothing concrete enough to 
substantiate its existence.
The only way to reach this god, Chtrax realized, was 
through the mighty power of a wish spell. Moreover, 
the xill knew where he could find one at minimal 
cost. Aware of the world’s largest dungeon, and its 
original purpose, he suspected the devil’s vault still 
contained a powerful pit fiend named Kator. If Chtrax 
could see this beast, he was certain he could gain the 
wish. A mad plan to be certain, Chtrax has been espe-
cially careful not to reveal the truth behind his goals, 
for he knows breaching the walls of the vault would 
surely result in the deaths of all his servants.
The wicked xill traveled a myriad of Material 
Planes, but for all his searching, he could not locate 
the place, though many had heard of it, and several 
dusty tomes spoke eloquently of it. ln frustration, 
he tortured and maimed many a sage and scholar 
in his efforts to locate the massive complex. Final-
ly, one brutalized soul gave him a name – Allmnan. 
Even Chtrax had heard of this ancient lore master, 
but he had believed, like most beings in the planes, 
the old man to be dead. He quickly tracked down the 
sage, finding him deep within the Astral Plane. After 
torturing the old man for two years, the sage finally 
revealed the location of the dungeon. Not trusting 
the information, Chtrax took the crippled scholar 
with him. When they finally reached the sprawling 
complex, he killed the old man and left his bones to 
rot on the surface, before descending into the dun-
geon’s tunnels.
Unable to locate the vault on his own, he suspected 
it remained concealed and intact. He also realized he 
could never hope to uncover the vault on his own, 
as the labor would be too overwhelming for just one 
creature, so he turned to the derro for assistance. In 
their warrens, they had uncovered extensive veins 
of truesilver, a substance especially useful for con-
trolling and containing devils, and deposits of ada-
mantine – two things Chtrax knew the celestials used 
to create the vault holding the fiends. With the recent 
geological instability, more and more clues revealed 
themselves to the malicious, self-serving xill, turning 
suspicion into solid evidence.
Before the inevitable assumption of control over 
the mad derro, Chtrax approached a trapped formian 
queen. Weakened and injured from a costly war with 
the derro, and desperate to be back in touch with 
the hive on her native plane, the xill’s honeyed words 
swayed her, and she agreed to transfer control over 
her most trusted myrmarchs in exchange for her 
freedom. The xill lied, of course, and murdered her 
in the shadows of an obscure cave with her eggs all 
around her, stealing her essence and trapping it in a 
special phylactery.
Considering the unusual nature of the region, 
Chtrax organized his minions with brutal efficiency. 
He commands the entire operation, answering to 
none. Serving him are three formian myrmarchs, 
each with specific duties. The only resistance to his 
authority comes from a rebel derro, the savant Souiji.
The first myrmarch oversees security of the min-
ing outfit and truesilver extraction in the Great Hall. 
Chtrax, not content with the truesilver extracted by 
the other myrmarch’s crews, started drilling into 
the Great Hall for more truesilver, entrusting this 
operation to the first myrmarch, in addition to his 
responsibilities for security. In fact, the Great Hall 
has transformed from this region’s central nervous 
system to a massive drill, refinement and transporta-
tion site. Hence, security is thinner there than it was, 
just a few short weeks ago. He also procures stone 
golems from the gnome, positioning the golems at 
checkpoints throughout the complex, and maintain-
ing existing ones. Finally, he has a squad of formian 
warriors serving him, some of whom ride gorgons. 
These guards oversee extraction caverns, patrol the 

276
tunnels, and ensure traps and sentry towers are in 
working order.
The second myrmarch controls the security and 
excavation of the northern mines. With the recent 
waves of plague and rogue xill ambushes, the place 
has collapsed into chaos. Furthermore, the myrmarch 
here does not trust the xill master, and bides his time, 
waiting for proof of his suspicions to surface. Most of 
the remaining labor there works to build a giant bore 
to expedite mining. 
The last myrmarch oversees excavation. A typi-
cal extraction crew consists of a taskmaster, derro 
leaders, a lesser savant, three handler crew and three 
teams. Each group of handlers control one of the fol-
lowing: bulette, destrachan or yrthak. Each monster 
digging team crushes the rocks, and the teams are 
responsible for removing the rubble. Two teams are 
composed of a grimlock foreman and duergar slaves, 
who clear away much of the debris created by the 
handler crews. The third team consist of a grimlock 
foreman and deep dwarf sounders. This crew uses a 
magic device created by the evil gnome to test the 
depth of the rock, search for dead caves, and material 
compositional changes. Their efforts are hazardous 
and futile; it’s dangerous to use the device because 
it occasionally unleashes crackling electricity, almost 
always vaporizing a slave or two; it is futile because 
the device only has an accurate range of about 5 to 10 
ft. due to the vault’s inherent warping nature.
Fortunately, the recent collapses and instability of 
their excavations severely reduced the derro’s com-
mand structure, allowing Chtrax to easily ingratiate 
himself, slipping past the paranoia and the xenopho-
bia that describes the psychology of this degenerate 
race. He rose quickly through the ranks to become 
the trusted advisor to the only remaining high savant, 
eventually supplanting the leader and taking control 
of the entire region. 
Chtrax amassed a large excavation force. The derro 
captured duergar and deep dwarves to serve as slaves. 
A legion of destrachan and several yrthak act as living 
tools to wear away the rock with their sonic attacks, 
while the formians offer security and additional labor 
for digging. The derro high savant tenuously controls 
a tarrasque, urging it to break through the bands of 
adamantine warding the vault. Chtrax has also gained 
the help from Korus, a particularly evil gnome who, 
though cruel enough to appreciate Chtrax’s plan, is 
not worthy in the xill’s eyes to be in possession of 
such guarded information. The gnome produces the 
wailing guardians, stone golems capable of creating 
a terrific noise, regular stone golems, tools to handle 
the truesilver, and all manner of other mining equip-
ment. Finally, Chtrax secretly injects eggs into the 
derro and slaves to replace his flawed subjects with 
reliable xill.
The warping effects of the vault impede divination 
spells, and even go so far as to disrupt magnetic im-
pulses rendering mechanical direction sense useless 
and confusing those with a propensity for navigation. 
For these reasons, Chtrax commands the workers to 
tunnel through the whole place. He knows the vault is 
close, but exactly where, he cannot say. The desperate 
digging undermines the entire complex, destabilizing 
it. Earthquakes ripple through the place, along with 
the aftershocks, collapsing tunnels and killing more 
slaves and servants daily. Each collapse sets back the 
operation, as Chtrax must commit labor to building 
and rebuilding retaining walls to allow the excavation 
to continue. Despite the losses, Chtrax is committed 
to uncovering the vault, capturing the pit fiend and 
discovering for himself where the dark god lies.
HIVE MIND
Formians normally share a collective consciousness 
when within 50 miles of the formian queen, 
allowing them to react to danger as if they all faced 
it simultaneously. Chtrax realized if he killed the 
formian queen, the formians would be useless to him 
and they would be aware of their queen’s death. To 
galvanize his command over these outsiders, Chtrax 
trapped her essence in special phylactery, which 
allows the formians to communicate through the 
myrmarchs, but only to the extent of their respective 
sections. Though the hive mind is intact, albeit to a 
lesser extent than before, the myrmarch would have 
been understandably suspicious, if it were nor for the 
queen’s mental missive to her minions commanding 
them to serve the xill. Now, the queen retains a 
presence in the minds of the myrmarchs, but it is 
only an echo from the past.

277
If a myrmarch controls a section, its death confuses 
the remaining formians, imposing disadvantage to 
all attacks, saves and checks. In addition, they lose 
access to their hive mind ability. If the PCs shatter the 
phylactery, the formians realize Chtrax duped them, 
and fight against Chtrax and his minions, turning on 
slaves, derro, giants and PCs. For more details, see 
Room D49 in the Great Hall.
XILL EGGS AND THE DERRO
Chtrax injected eggs into the derro and slaves serving 
him. Consequently, the derro and dwarf population is 
on the decline, as more and more of these outsiders 
hatch. Left alone, xill would eventually replace all the 
derro and slaves, being a far more disciplined work 
force for the evil master.
This affliction has interesting side effects. Whenever 
the PCs encounter a derro or dwarf, there is a 25% 
chance the creature is host for a xill egg. Infected 
derro and dwarves are at risk of premature hatching 
whenever they take damage. When the infected’s hit 
points fall below half their normal total, roll 1d20. If 
the result is more than his hit point total, a full-grown 
xill immediately erupts out of its host’s chest, killing 
him in the process. The xill spends 1 round assessing 
its situation before attacking the nearest non-derro. 
Any dwarf slaves witnessing the “birth,” must succeed 
DC 15 Wisdom saves or become frightened for 1d4 
minutes – derro see a xill hatching as a sign of their 
foul goddess’ blessing.
CONSTANT EFFECTS
The proximity to the vault makes negotiating these 
tunnels a challenge. The magical emanations have a 
warping effect on magnetic north, imposing dis-
advantage on all Wisdom (Survival) checks made to 
determine direction, Wisdom (Perception) checks to 
determine approximate depth below ground, and any 
other check involving navigating the depths.
The warping field extends to magic too; spells 
determining direction (locate object, for example) 
automatically fail. Worse, it effectively impedes all 
other divination spells. Whenever a spellcaster casts 
a divination spell, that caster must succeed at an 
Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 20 + the spell’s level) 
or the spell is lost. In addition, the field immediately 
deals 3d12 psychic damage to the caster and drains 
2d6 spell slots (starting with the highest), as unset-
tling images of devils standing in a sea of blood beat 
against walls or some invisible barrier. If the caster 
succeeds, the spell dissipates without effect, and they 
become aware of something ominous.
Given these impediments, neither Chtrax nor his 
minions have any sense of where they dig, causing 
them to backtrack, dig towards the lava, up or down, 
just about in any direction. Moreover, because of the 
haphazard digging, the entire complex is unstable. 
Each hour the PCs spend in this region, there is a 
10% chance of an earthquake, as per the spell, cen-
tered on their position (save DC 19).
Finally, all rooms are dark unless otherwise noted. 
The creatures here are accustomed to working in total 
darkness. The gnome designed a special alchemi-
cal material lighting areas without affecting other 
creatures with light sensitivity, thereby allowing a few 
creatures to work alongside the duergar and derro.

278
A Race Against Time
Chtrax is close to achieving his goals. Every day, his servants come closer to stumbling across the 
vault. The region is highly organized, but the unusual permutations emitted by the vault distort 
and confound their magical efforts to locate it. The likelihood of its discovery is random; no effort, 
aside from random continued digging, can guarantee its breach. Realizing this, Chtrax commands 
his forces to dig. Their perseverance should ultimately result in the discovery and consequent 
breech of the unholy tomb, releasing the devils into the world once more.
TIMELINE
Day 0: PCs enter the derro mines.
Day 1: Nothing
Day 2: Derro miners in Room D22 break through to Room D27. The stone giant chief leads a force 
and exterminates the derro, slaves and beasts in the Old Mines except those derro in Room D19.
Day 3: Tarrasque reaches the first adamantine bands. All surviving formian warriors and gorgons 
move to Room D58.
Day 4: Tarrasque breaches first band. 
Day 5: Tarrasque breaches second band. 
Day 6: Guards and wards effect in the Old Mines ends. Tarrasque breaches the third band.
Day 7: Tarrasque breaches the vault itself, unleashing the hordes of devils contained within.
Day 12: The miners at Room D79 breach the vault, if the tarrasque does not.
The derro and the monsters serving them dig- unworked stone. To reflect the progress through 
most of these rooms, expect the depth of each tunnel to continue 10 ft. each day, except in rooms 
near the tomb (Room D59 though Room D63, Room D78 to Room D80). These rooms are magi-
cally treated and require the tarrasque for much of the digging. In these rooms, mark progress by 
5 ft. each day. Once the tunnels cross an existing tunnel the digging stops and the formian myr-
marchs redistributed crews to other rooms. 
Three days after the PCs first enter the complex the tarrasque reaches the adamantine bands 
(see the Tomb of the Devils). When this happens, Chtrax realizes he is close to his objective. At this 
point, he moves all formian warriors and gorgons from their respective locations to Room D58, 
letting those unsupervised crews do as they wish. The tarrasque breaches one adamantine band 
per day, finally cracking the vault and releasing the devils into the region. 
The PCs have about seven days to stop Chtrax and his minions from achieving their goals. It 
is important to convey urgency, but without directly telling them what is afoot. While there are 
clues through the locations, feel free to add details to keep the PCs on track. If the PCs fail to stop 
Chtrax, the devils break free and pour through the tunnels, bent on killing and enslaving. For 
details on the devil’s actions if they break free from their prison, consult the Introduction to the 
Vault, below.

D1- D6 . FOREBODING
D1 . SENTRY TOWER
Standing on the broken plain is a 100 ft. tower. 
Instead of a roof, a large spike bears the impaled 
effigy of an unrecognizable humanoid. Three bas-
reliefs of demonic faces decorate the surface of the 
structure. On the brows of each of the faces is a 
bright blue, red and yellow gemstone, each about 
a foot in diameter. Aside from the opened maws 
spilling reddish fluid, perhaps blood, there are no 
entrances into the building. A few scattered piles 
of broken bones litter the immediate vicinity, some 
partly submerged in the crimson runoff.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This encounter refers to all three watch-
towers positioned at the perimeter of the derro 
mines. Derro savants created these towers to deter 
unwarned attention. With the towers complete and 
the savant derro dead from the flooding, Chtrax 
commanded his gnome servant to upgrade each of 
them. The gnome constructed special stone golems 
for the derro, placed on a spike, making the golem 
appear to be nothing more than part of the struc-
ture’s obscene decor. Unlike normal stone golems, 
the gnome used petrified humanoids created by 
gorgon guards instead of a single block of granite, 
and their forms are visible in the golem’s bodies.
When the heroes approach within 100 ft. of 
the towers, allow each of them to make a DC 20 
Wisdom (Perception) check. A successful check in-
dicates scorch marks and deep impressions on the 
plain approaching the tower. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The tower itself is a proximity trap. The tower 
targets any non-derro approaching within 100 ft. 
with one of the following spells once each round: 
fireball, lightning bolt or ice storm. The tower can 
use each spell once per day (save DC 16). The spell 
resets in 24 hours.
Once the tower exhausts its spells, the impaled 
golem at the tower’s top animates and pulls itself 
off from the spike in a grisly display. Once on the 
ground, it moves to attack PCs within 100 ft. of the 
tower. If the PCs retreat beyond the tower’ range, 
or fall into the lava, the stone golem remains at 
the perimeter for 1d8 minutes before returning to 
the tower.
Treasure: Scattered about the plain are bits of cloth-
ing, bone and the remains of others who thought 
to approach the complex. PCs may search the room 
and find a few valuables left by the fallen. The PCs 
discover one item every 10 minutes they spend 
searching: a gem worth 10d10 x 10 gp, a +1 truesil-
ver melee weapon, a random potion, or a random 
minor wondrous item.
After finding all four items, or after 40 minutes 
of searching, the PCs find nothing else.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the wailing golem activate immediately and 
allow the tower to use each spell twice per day. To 
decrease the challenge, the tower can use one of 
the listed spells, once per day.
D2 . STATUE OF SUPPLICATION
At the edge of the rocky outcropping kneels a statue 
of a man carved from grey stone. Much of its body 
is worn and chipped, seemingly ancient. Its head 
hangs on its chest, perhaps in prayer or sleep, 
concealing its facial features for the most part. 
Behind it rise three stone mounds. Broken stone, 
trash and other debris litter the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The statue is a stone golem (see Room 
D1). The derro in Room D3 positioned the golem 
here to warn off any intruders. Unfortunately, this 
golem is old and unreliable, being a prototype for 
those on the sentry towers. It does not function 
properly and only notices intruders half of the time. 
Chtrax, lacking the inclination or the resources to 
construct a replacement, temporarily positioned 
several derro guards in a hollow pillar of rock 
(see Room D3 for details) to reinforce the weak-
ened defenses.
Encounter Condition: Fear 18
Tactics: When the PCs step onto the landing, the 
golem rolls a DC 10 Wisdom check to notice. If it 
fails the check, it does not animate unless the PC 

280
touches it, in which case it immediately ani-
mates. Due to the golem’s age, it sometimes 
gets confused. Each round, the golem must 
make a DC 10 Wisdom check or suffer the 
effects of confusion for the round. If not con-
fused, it attacks with slow, catching as many 
PCs as it can. On the next round, it grabs a 
slowed PC and hurls them into the smoking 
lava below. 
This construct is under orders to fight to 
the death. 
The wailing attracts the attention of the 
derro guards in Room D3. One of the der-
ro activates the trap at Room D6, while his 
comrades ready their light crossbows. On the 
second round of combat, the derro target the 
PCs with poisoned bolts.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this en-
counter, add one wailing golem. To decrease 
the challenge, reduce the number of derro by 
2 or increase the time it takes them to re-
spond to 1d3 rounds.
D3 . TOWER OF DEATH
This irregular mound of stone is 25 ft. thick 
and 25 ft. high. Patches of multicolored fungus 
cling to its surface. Dark clefts and pits in the 
mound of rock are common higher up, and 
several webs with scuttling spiders fill the 
smaller holes.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This mound of stone is hollow. A 
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals 
a false stone, when pressed, opens a secret 
door. On the inside of the mound stands a 
complex arrangement of scaffolding allowing 
access to the innumerable arrow slits over-
looking the entire landing.
Ten derro guards man this watch tower. 
Chtrax positioned these unruly guards here 
to serve dual purposes. First, he wanted to en-
sure the golem functioned properly at Room 
D2, and if not, have a failsafe sentry. Second, 
confident the golem works, Chtrax wanted 
to remove these troublesome derro from the 
main operation.
TRUESILVER
Truesilver is a scarce and unusual alloy of mithral 
and silver. Nearly never worked, truesilver loses 
its special properties, becoming normal silver, if 
ever touched by a creature other than an aberra-
tion or fiend. If forged into tools, the metal is just 
as good as steel. Furthermore, wholly or partially 
constructed truesilver enhances magic items 
with spell effects from the enchantment school, 
increasing save DCs for these spell effects by +2.
Weapons or armor fashioned from truesilver are 
always masterwork and confer a nonmagical +1 
bonus to attack and damage rolls, and a +1 bonus 
to the armor or shields armor bonus to AC. The 
masterwork cost is included in the prices listed 
below.
Truesilver is also useful as a material compo-
nent for casting spells with the good descriptor. 
A caster may add 25 gp of truesilver per spell level 
as a material component to any good spell he 
casts. Doing so increases the spell save DC and 
spell attack bonus by +1 each. Truesilver is also an 
exceptional material for constructing holy weap-
ons, for it takes good spells easier than other ma-
terials during the enchanting process. A properly 
crafted holy symbol (GM decides requirements, 
crafting DC, etc.) grants a +2 to spell save DCs 
when used to cast a cleric spell (this effect does 
not stack with the bonus from expending 25 gp of 
truesilver mentioned above).
Truesilver weapons also deal an extra +1d6 
damage against evil creatures.

281
Each derro knows some portion of the xill’s 
plan, but none are smart enough to understand 
the significance. As no derro trusts the other, they 
have not collaborated to compare what they have 
learned. To make matters worse, the Chtrax im-
pregnated them before exiling them to this remote 
tower. The master of the mines assumes the young 
xill will take care of the problem for him.
Encounter Condition: Fear 18
Tactics: The derro are not especially watchful and 
are lax about their duties. They spend most of their 
time arguing with each other or muttering madly to 
themselves in their darkened corners. Assume the 
derro are not looking or listening for intruders, as 
they expect the golem to alert them to trouble.
If the PCs open the secret door, make a loud 
noise outside, or do anything to draw attention, the 
derro rouse from their bickering and attack PCs us-
ing heavy repeating crossbows and poisoned bolts. 
One derro activates the trap at Room D6 by pulling 
a lever and joins his comrades in shooting the PCs 
on the following round.
The arrow slits give the derro improved cover, 
granting a +8 bonus to AC and Dexterity saves and 
a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks. There are 
so many arrow slits the derro can attack virtually 
any target with line of sight to the hollowed tow-
er. Despite their isolation and exiled status, these 
derro are as crazy as any other derro, fighting to 
the death.
Should the PCs avoid this encounter and return 
later, a xill replaces one derro for each passing day.
Treasure: Inside the tower are four large barrels of 
water. There is also a ceramic pot filled with black 
adder venom (+2d6 poison damage), enough to 
coat 20 bolts.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the sneak attack damage of the derro by 
+1d6. To decrease the challenge, reduce the number 
of derro by 2.
D4 . MAD SCRAWL
This column of stone reaches 30 ft. high before 
tapering off into a sharp break. It is apparent 
this structure was once taller as evidenced by the 
debris and rubble littering the place. Otherwise, the 
mound appears commonplace.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This earthen column, along with Room 
D5, once supported a roof, but the recent instability 
of the caverns caused it to collapse, littering this 
room with debris. The uncertain flooring and debris 
cuts movement in half. PCs investigating the room 
notice with a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check 
graffiti on the southern face of the pillar. PCs capa-
ble of reading Undercommon make out the follow-
ing words: “Hurt,” “Help me,” “It’s inside,” “Curse 
all my traitorous brothers and their foul master!” A 
fleeing duergar driven mad by his captivity found 
he could not escape the lava flow, and so in resig-
nation, carved words onto the surface of the pillar. 
The xill egg inside him burst and the xill consumed 
his body, dumping the bones into the lava before 
wandering through the uninhabited mines.

D5 . TRAPPED COLUMN
This tower of rock extends upward some thirty feet, 
where it still supports part of the collapsed ceiling 
once sheltering this place. Rubble and bone line 
the floor, making the footing uncertain. Something 
metallic on the eastern side of this column reflects 
the light emitted by the lava.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The metallic sheen originates from a per-
manent image (DC 20 Wisdom save disbelieves) of 
a longsword stuck into the rock. The sword is a lure 
to ensnare the foolish and greedy, for just above the 
illusion is a glyph of warding (explosive runes).
 '
Glyph of Warding Trap. DC 22 Wisdom (Investi-
gation) or Intelligence (Arcana) check to notice, 
DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disable. 8d8 
thunder damage to all targets within 5 ft. Dexterity 
save DC 17.
Encounter Condition: Drafty
Tactics: If the golem or the PCs actions did not alert 
the derro in Room D3, triggering the glyph alerts 
them. The derro respond as described in Room D3, 
activating the trap at Room D6, and firing poisoned 
bolts at the PCs from positions of improved cover.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the trap damage to 10d8. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the damage to 5d8.
D6. Trapped Gate
In the center of the convex surface of unworked 
stone is 10-ft-wide portal opening into an immense 
gallery. On either side of the gate, bas reliefs of 
derro push towards the opening as if trying to 
shut it. The lintel features bleached and cracked 
white skulls sitting in a row stop the whole width 
of the gate.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Unless the PCs alert or otherwise engage 
the derro at Room D3, the trap in this gate does not 
function. The derro leave the gate trap disengaged 
because it kills indiscriminately, and instead of kill-
ing their replacements, they opt to leave it disabled. 
However, combat with the derro guarantees the 
activation of the trap. The trap activates whenever 
anyone steps though the gate, causing the walls 
to slam shut, pulping anyone caught between. 
The gate automatically resets after each attack, so 
should someone remain in the room, it triggers 
again, dealing damage once more. The gate con-
tinues to slam shut and reset as long as anything 
occupies the room.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs move past the tower of death, 
Room D3, and the derro inside are aware of them, 
the derro activate this trap in the hope of past-
ing a few of the invaders, while peppering them 
with arrows.
The slamming gate creates a lot of noise, certain 
to attract wandering monsters. Immediately roll for 
a Random Encounter each time the trap activates.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the crushing gate trap to 
22d8. To decrease the challenge, have the trap jam 
after the second activation.
 '
Crushing Gate Trap.  Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Percep-
tion); Disable: DC 15 Dexterity; Characters trigger-
ing the trap must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving 
throw or suffer 63 (18d6) bludgeoning damage. A 
successful saving throw results in half damage.

283
D7- D20 . OLD MINES
Derro rebels control this area, and their racial mad-
ness has worsened in isolation, making them excep-
tionally paranoid and delusional. Souiji, the derro’s 
savant, sporadically sends out raiding parties into 
sections controlled by Chtrax to kill formians, derro 
slaves, and anything else getting in their way. The 
rebels use hit-and-run tactics to avoid capture know-
ing, despite their madness, they are far outnumbered.
The derro have trapped all the corridors leading to 
their warrens. The traps here are vicious, resulting in 
countless formian deaths. There are signs of formian 
remains throughout; their heads decorate the tunnels 
as grisly trophies.
Souiji leads these derro in their guerrilla war. Delu-
sional beyond all the rest, he trusts no one, not even 
his fellow rebels. Once a week he sacrificed one of his 
servants to the goddess of the derro in a futile effort 
to forestall the inevitable demise they all face when 
the xill eggs inside them hatch. Souiji stole a map of 
warding (see Room D19) from Chtrax before fleeing 
from the Great Hall. He uses it at the start of each 
day but unfortunately it has only six charges left so he 
knows his time is running out. The effects of the spell 
cover all encounter rooms, from Room D8 to Room 
D24 with particular effects, included in the encounter 
below. Souiji has six charges starting on Day 0, and 
all effects attributed to the guards and wards spell 
end on Day 6.
If the PCs have not vanquished Souiji and his min-
ions by Day 2, the miners in Room D22 accidentally 
break through the wall to Room D27. The stone giant 
chief in this uncovered room leads an expedition to 
kill the rogue derro, along with three additional stone 
giants, a formian taskmaster with two dominated de-
strachans and three formian warriors. Inside the old 
tunnel, the giants quickly dispatch all derro they find 
there and establish three stone giants as guards. The 
giants then invade Souiji’s sanctuary on Day 6, killing 
the savant and his remaining minions. Alternatively, 
if the PCs dispatch the stone giant chief in Room D27 
before destroying the rebel derro, the miners conceal 
the breach and use this exit to mount raids through-
out the rest of the complex. 
All rooms here are dark unless otherwise specified. 
In addition, a dense fog fills Room D8 through Room 
D24, providing half cover to all those within the shift-
ing mists, and reducing vision, including darkvision, 
to 10 ft The air stinks of rot. The walls are unworked 
stone and the ceiling averages 10 ft in height, while 
smaller, narrow tunnels are only 5 ft tall. Bones, trash, 
metal scraps and spider webs litter the corridors and 
rooms, making charging impossible and forcing PCs 
to succeed a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check for 
run actions.

D7 . OLD DERRO ENCAMPMENT
This massive gallery houses the ruins of an ancient 
village. The building that once filled this room now 
stands in ruins, shattered by chunks of fallen rock 
and massive stalactites. Pools of brackish water 
glisten in the darkness and overhead you see the 
tips of more stalactites emerging from the darkness 
of the concealed ceiling. Tunnels lead off into the 
fog-filled darkness as distant grinding noises echo 
from one of the corridors ahead.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room lies in utter ruin, destroyed 
by the flooding and earthquakes that ravaged the 
entire complex. Individual buildings lay shattered, 
preventing entry altogether. Random Encounters 
in this room should be more frequent than rec-
ommended, as wandering creatures are prone to 
be here as they move to the other mines. Roll for 
Random Encounters every 15 minutes.
Searching the ruins uncovers the remains of 
derro. Most of the corpses are skeletal but some are 
preserved. In addition to the bodies of the derro 
there are bones of a destrachan, a few duegar, and 
even a stone giant. Most of the corpses lack the ca-
pacity to speak if subject to speak with dead though 
the preserved corpses could impart the following 
with the appropriate questions.
What happened in this room? The goddess grew 
angry and flooded our mines with her tears (Insta-
bility of the caverns caused a lake from above to 
flood the caverns decade ago).
Where are the derro now? Dead. (As far as the 
corpses know the flood wiped out all of the derro.)
What were you digging for? I do not know. (The 
derro savants commanded their followers to dig, 
after receiving an enigmatic vision. With their de-
struction, their original motives are now lost.)
The corpses’ responses to any other questions 
result in confusion or ignorance.
PCs tracking and succeeding a DC 5 Wisdom 
(Survival) check identify significant traffic from the 
north to the south. A DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) 
check indicates light traffic to the southwest tunnel.
Encounter Condition: Drafty
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs searching the ruins may uncover trea-
sure in addition to the moldering corpses and trash. 
If a PC devotes an hour to searching and succeeds a 
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, he finds one of 
the following items: an arcane scroll (darkvision, fly), 
flawed sapphire (635 gp) and a pair of gauntlets of 
ogre power.
It is possible for the PCs to uncover more 
treasure, but the likelihood of searching this room 
unmolested is slim. In addition to the increased 
likelihood of Random Encounters, searching this 
room is noisy, so roll for an additional Random 
Encounter. After 30 minutes and whenever the PCs 
make a loud noise, subtract 1 from the roll (min-
imum of 1).
Scaling: N/A
D8 . TRAPPED HALLWAY
Fog fills this corridor, muting light, and making 
footing uncertain. Broken spider webs hang from 
the ceiling, and bones litter the floor. The corridor 
extends as far as you can see. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Halfway down this tunnel, 30 ft. from 
the entrance, is a large hole in the ceiling. Several 
weeks ago, a pair of derro miners uncovered an 
unusual lump of stone covered in runes. One of 
them foolishly traced the rune and found himself 
splattered on the ceiling far above, having unlocked 
the stone’s reverse gravity effect. Souiji saw this find 
as a boon granted by the derro goddess. Exper-
imentation with the stone revealed he could not 
deactivate it, but he devised a way to put its magical 
properties to work.
The exiled savant commanded miners to dig a 40 
ft hole in the ceiling of the entrance corridor. With 
sovereign glue, Souiji affixed metal rungs to the wall 
beneath, and glued the enchanted rock at the top of 
the hole in the ceiling. Every morning, he places a 
magic mouth in the pit through his casting of guards 
and wards. The result of his ingenuity is a permanent 
trap functioning to ensnare enemies and alert the 
derro to intruders.
Earlier a destrachan had the misfortune to find 
itself ensnared by the trap. In its frustration, it used 
its destructive harmonics to blast away at the walls of 
its imprisonment. Its rage made escape all the more 

285
difficult. By the time the PCs discover the reverse pit 
trap, the destrachan is enraged, ready to kill. It lashes 
out at anyone who passes beneath it or falls inside.
 '
Reverse Gravity Pit Trap. Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 20 Dexterity; DC 20 Dexterity 
saving throw to avoid the trap or suffer the spell 
effect (reverse gravity) and suffer 14 (4d6) bludgeon-
ing damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Secretly make a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check for any PCs moving 25 ft. down the corridor. 
A successful check indicates the PC notices a series 
of metal rungs set into the western wall. PCs who 
see the rungs may bypass the trap easily. However, 
the destrachan with blindsight attacks the PC with 
its destructive harmonics attack. PCs falling into 
the pit must contend with the enraged monster as 
well as risking damage from the fall. Trapped PCs 
can climb up the walls to escape the ceiling pit by 
succeeding a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.
A PC hitting the bottom of the pit triggers the 
magic mouth created by the guards and wards 
spell. It babbles in a terrifically loud voice “There 
are intruders invading the sacred hall of Souiji the 
Mighty.” The mouth repeats the message but fin-
ishes with “There are intruders...” Once the magic 
mouth ends roll for wandering monsters. Allow the 
derro in Room D22 a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to detect the noise. If the derro hear the 
screams two of them move to the edge of the pit to 
investigate. With the random formian patrols kill-
ing derro, and the instability of the caverns, if the 
investigating derro do not return, the rest continue 
working, fearful of Souiji’s rage.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the depth of the fall to 80 ft. To de-
crease the challenge, replace the destrachan with 
a digester.
D9 . FUSILLADE OF DARTS
Though the roiling mists conceal much, the 
obscene paintings on the walls of this tunnel are 
clear. The scenes depict imagery of blue-skinned 
dwarves sacrificing humanoids to warped idols, 
great dragons with oily black scales breathing 
death on fleeing orcs, and grotesque scenes of 
demons and devils cavorting with mortals. The 
pictures cover the tunnel, floors, walls and ceiling, 
leading to a disturbing sense of being present in the 
pictured hell.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A talented but misguided and mad derro 
artist painted this tunnel to conceal the activation 
trigger of a lethal trap firing a hail of poisoned 
darts. The mechanism is simple – if 5 or more 
pounds of weight touches the pressure plate, a 
fusillade of darts fires up from the floor. Given the 
density of the paintings and the persistent fog, this 
trap has claimed its fair share of formian hunters 
and treasure seekers. Even the derro have a diffi-
cult time remembering exactly where the pressure 
plate lays.
 '
Fusillade of Deathblade Darts. Detect: DC 25 Wisdom 
(Perception); Disable: DC 25 Dexterity; +10 to hit; 
7 (2d6) poison damage (DC 20 Constitution saving 
throw for half damage).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs can find the trap by succeeding a DC 32 
(the fog adds a +5 to the DC) Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check. Triggering the trap causes a number of 
darts to fire at the PC stepping on the plate. Once 
per day, a single derro from room D20 comes to 
remove any corpses killed by the trap.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the poison damage reduce the target’s maxi-
mum hit points until the end of the next long rest. 
To reduce the challenge, reduce the save DC by -5.

D10 . INTERSECTION
Roiling clouds of mist fill this intersection, 
impeding your vision. Odd noises, clacking sounds 
and an occasional groan sound from ahead. 
Through the gloom, you see three tunnels leading 
away. All of the tunnels are dark and murky, filled 
with more of the same clammy fog. In the center 
of the three tunnels is a headless granite statue 
of a robed man with arms upraised and pointing 
in your direction. Then, you notice several torches 
bobbing down one of the tunnels. Shortly after 
their appearance, they disappear around a comer.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Several things happen as soon as the 
PCs enter this room. First, their appearance trig-
gers the dancing light created by guards and wards. 
These bobbing lights appear as torches. Souiji 
programmed the dancing lights to appear as soon 
as a living creature enters the intersection at the 
edge of Room D11 and waits there for three rounds 
before moving back into the room and disappear-
ing. The derro savant hopes to lure intruders to the 
suggestion and stinking cloud in Room D11 in an 
effort to distract and destroy them before they get 
too deep into his territory.
Second, the statue in the hall always faces the 
largest number of PCs, pivoting on its base. The 
derro here constructed it to frustrate and confuse 
intruders, hoping to stall them long enough to 
mount a counterstrike. However, with the derro 
rebels’ numbers depleted, the function of the statue 
serves little more than as a distraction.
Third, this intersection features a confusion 
effect, making it 50% probable that the PCs believe 
they are going in the opposite direction from the 
one chosen. There is no saving throw for this.
A PC succeeding at a DC 22 Wisdom (Survival) 
check notices the tracks of small creatures moving 
from the hall leading to Room D22 to the hall lead-
ing to Room D13.
Encounter Condition: Drafty
Tactics: When the statue moves on its base, it grinds 
loudly, echoing down the tunnel. The derro in 
Room D22 are accustomed to the random noises, 
but if the PCs are indecisive and test the statue by 
moving around, three derro from Room D22 and 
four more from Room D20 come to investigate.

D11 . HASTILY PATCHED HOLE
The tunnels slightly widen before terminating at 
a cracked and fissured wall. Charred carcasses 
litter the floor here along with small piles of slag 
and ash. The room stinks of burned meat and 
rotten eggs. Bright light shines through the cracks 
of the far wall. You think you hear whistling of 
wind, as well.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A week ago, a team of derro rebels, 
searching for a way out, accidentally broke through 
this wall to the lava beyond. The room filled with 
the molten rock and magma mephitis, killing all 
the miners instantly. Souiji realized this room could 
serve as an excellent trap. He commanded duergar 
slaves to erect a shoddy retaining wall, just strong 
enough to keep the lava out, but easily destroyed 
with a well-placed hit. Then, he commanded the 

287
duergar to chisel away the floor near the wall to 
allow more lava to fill in, should the wall fall.
With the room complete, Souiji uses a guards 
and wards (suggestion) to suggest to the first person 
entering the room that what lays beyond the wall is 
in fact the way out, urging them to escape. Beyond 
the wall the gust of wind blows the stinking cloud at 
the wall, so when the wall collapses, the wind blows 
the stinking cloud inside along with the lava.
The first person entering the room must suc-
ceed a DC 15 Wisdom save or take a suggestion to 
break down the wall and escape the dungeon. The 
wall has 15 hp and a damage threshold of 15.
Encounter Condition: Tremors 18
Tactics: If the PC reduces the wall’s hit points to 0, it 
shatters and collapses, releasing the stinking cloud 
into the first 20 ft. of this room and forcing all in-
side the area of effect to succeed a DC 15 Constitu-
tion save or become nauseated and poisoned for as 
long as they remain inside the affected area and for 
1d4+1 rounds afterward. In addition to the effects of 
the spell, lava splashes all PCs in the cloud’s effect, 
dealing 21 (6d6) points of fire damage, DC 15 Dex-
terity save for half.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add 1d6 magma mephits and 1d4 steam mephits to 
the lava. To decrease the challenge, reduce the lava 
splash to 4d6 points of damage.
D12 . SCYTHE GAUNTLET
This tunnel features the same clinging mists 
encountered since you first entered these mines. 
Littering the length of the tunnel are dismembered 
limbs and heads of strange insect creatures, and 
stains of green ichor splashed in random patterns 
throughout. The tunnel continues ahead beyond the 
limits of your vision.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This tunnel heads south before turning 
back to the east. Where it turns, three trip wires 
stretch across the width of the tunnel, concealed 
by the mists. Pressure of any kind triggers the trap, 
causing razor sharp scythes to snap out of hidden 
recesses and slash anyone in their way. On the fol-
lowing round, poison gas mixes with the fog, filling 
the air with deadly maddening poison.
A derro name R’Tobn designed this devious 
trap to impress his master with his ingenuity. 
Souiji rewarded the enterprising derro by letting 
him test the trap himself. A PC succeeding a DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check finds the rotting 
severed remains of the derro inventor near the 
tripwires. Souiji permits no one smarter than he is 
to serve him. 
Finding the trip wires is difficult in the poor 
lighting and thick fog. Worse, all three wires are at 
different heights, and it only takes triggering one 
of them to set off the trap. PCs can find the central 
wire by succeeding a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) 
check. If they succeed by 5 or more, they find the 
other two wires. 
Tripping any one of the three wires will activate 
the trap. Two wall scythes lash out from hidden 
recesses for each 10-ft. section of the hall’s length. 
Each blade carries a virulent form of filth fever, 
having no incubation time and dealing damage 
immediately on a failed saving throw. On the 
following round, the hall fills with poison gas. The 
gas disperses three rounds after the trap triggers. 
Roll randomly per 10-ft. section to determine the 
scythes’ targets.
 '
Filth Fever Wall Scythe Traps (2 per 10-ft. section). 
Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 
18 Dexterity; +6 to hit; 9 (2d4+8) slashing damage. 
Each creature hit must succeed on a DC 11 Consti-
tution saving throw or the damage reduces its max-
imum hit points until the end of itsnext long rest.
 '
Poison Gas Trap. Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Percep-
tion); Disable: DC 20 Dexterity; +6 to hit; all crea-
tures in the hall must make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or suffer 7 (2d6) poison damage. A 
successful saving throw results in half damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Though the scythe blades create a lot of 
noise, scraping out of the hidden recesses, the 
derro in this section are accustomed to the trap’s 
activation and are confident in its ability to dispatch 
intruders.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
double the damage of the trap. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the number of scythe traps to 
one per 10-ft. section and remove the possibility of 
reducing maximum hit points.

D13 . BURROW
The long tunnel opens into a wide chamber clouded 
by swirling mist preventing you from gauging 
its actual size. Through the haze, you see debris 
consisting of sharp rocks and bones littering the 
floor. There is a definite stench of rotten meat 
mixed with another sharp and acrid smell. To the 
right, warm light shines through the fog, and to the 
left are sounds of metal ringing on stone.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room serves as a large intersection 
connecting several smaller tunnels leading to the 
various lairs for the rogue derro controlling this 
section. In the southern end of this room are three 
5-ft. diameter tunnels housing three ankhegs.  The 
derro befriended these beasts and now employ 
them as guards. The light the PCs notice emanates 
from Room D14 where the lava has collapsed some 
of the floor. Otherwise, the fog effect of guards and 
wards permeates this chamber, concealing other 
exits from this room. 
This room also carries the same confusion effect 
as found in Room D10. The confusion effect makes 
it 50% probable that the PCs believe they are going 
in the opposite direction from the one they chose. 
The floor in this room is worse than other areas 
in this section. The poor footing reduces speed to 
half, making the Dash Action impossible.
Encounter Condition: Fog 10
Tactics: Unless a derro accompanies the PCs – these 
creatures learned to distinguish the vibrations 
made by their makers from other tremors – the 
ankhegs detect intruders as soon as they enter the 
room. The ankhegs squirm out from their tunnels 
and attack the nearest PC. While in the narrow 
tunnels, they take a -4 penalty to attack rolls and AC 
and move at half speed. Once out of the tunnels, 
the ankhegs move at normal speed, having adapted 
to the treacherous floor. These creatures fight to 
the death. 
Sounds of combat attract the attention of the 
derro in Room D20. They come to investigate in 1d3 
rounds. Allow Souiji (Room D19), a DC 11 Wisdom 
(Perception) check to hear the sounds of the con-
flict. If he succeeds, he casts a few protective spells 
in preparation of an invader breech. 
If the PCs explore this room after Day 2, remove 
the ankhegs and replace them with 4 formian war-
riors sentries.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of the encoun-
ter, add three ankhegs. To decrease the challenge, 
increase the number of rounds it takes for derro to 
investigate to 1d6 rounds.
D14 . PLAYED-OUT MINE
The narrow tunnel opens into a bright cave, heated 
to uncomfortable levels by a mass of lava fed by 
a hole in the wall. Here you see a sea of magma, 
with small creatures swimming through the molten 
rock, tossing globules of magma at wispy imps 
flying near the lava’s surface. Steam clouds much 
of the room, concealing the details, though it is 
clear the footing is unusual, with ripples and waves 
common to flowstone. Beyond the pool of smoking 
magma is another tunnel leading off into more 
gloom, lit by the feeble light of a fallen torch. A 
slight tremor shakes the chamber causing streams 
of dust to fall from above and a rock to splash into 
the magma. As soon as the tremor stops, you hear 
someone call out to you from the darkened cave 
across the pool of lava.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Duergar miners, like the ones in Room 
D11, accidentally broke through the outer wall of 
this complex, flooding the room with magma. The 
retreating slaves fled down another tunnel where 
they died in Room D16. Unable to fill the breach, 
the derro in the rest of the section leave this room 
alone, fearing the lava’s spread throughout the rest 
of the tunnels.
Each day, Souiji places a magic mouth inside the 
small tunnel on the opposite side of the pool of 
magma. Three rounds after a non-derro enters the 
room, the spell calls for help (in Common) saying, 
“Help...I’m trapped...Oh please help me,” before 
falling quiet. Lying on the floor in the tunnel’s bend 
is a small globe of light created by the guards and 
wards dancing lights effect to appear as a dropped 
torch. The effect of this is to lure invaders across 
the lava to expose them to the concealed stinking 
cloud triggered by their crossing.

289
Crossing the pool of lava should be relatively 
simple for PCs of this level, as they probably have 
the means to fly across it. However, crossing the 
lava triggers the stinking cloud laying just beneath 
the surface of the lava, causing the lava to bubble 
up and splash all crossing PCs dealing 2d6 point of 
fire damage and exposing those PCs to the effects 
of the stinking cloud. PCs in the area of effect must 
succeed DC 19 Constitution saves or become nau-
seated for as long as they remain over top of the 
lava and 1d4+1 rounds after they leave.
Encounter Condition: [Deep Darkness]
Tactics: The derro ignore any sounds coming from 
this room, as they are used to intruders falling vic-
tim to this trap.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D15 . FLOW
Beyond the rift in the wall, it is clear the apparent 
sea of lava is in fact a wide river of molten rock 
flowing sluggishly into an enormous cave farther 
downstream. Partly submerged in the flow is an 
odd device, similar to a wagon, but with a large 
glass canister, several burned hoses and a cone at 
the end. The lava conceals the rest of the machine. 
Corpses crowd the top of the device. Some of 
the bodies are obviously missing legs or arms, 
and charred by the flow. Despite the condition of 
the bodies, and the burned hoses, the machine 
seems intact. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The “wagon” in the lava is a magical 
device called a sounder (see Room D53 for details). 
The derro use it to determine depth and direction 
while digging. The gnomes constructed the ma-
chine, but with the unusual qualities of the mines, 
it works sporadically, occasionally unleashing a 
stroke of raw electricity, killing one or two slaves per 
discharge. This sounder and the unfortunate slaves 
fell into the lava at Room D11, and floated down 
stream before an adamantine spar beneath the 
surface of the magma snared it. The corpses have 
all succumbed to poisonous vapors, starvation and 
splashing lava.
If the PCs cross the lava, they attract the atten-
tion of 1d6 magma mephits and 1d6 steam me-
phits, who attack at once.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The mephits attack any PC crossing the 
stream. The magma mephits use fire on the first 
round to create clouds of smoke, while the steam 
mephits employ steam to mask their positions 
before closing in for the attack. Thereafter, both 
types of mephits use breath weapon attacks to hit 
as many opponents as possible.
Should the combat continue more than four 
rounds, 1d3 magma and steam mephits come 
along to join the combat. More show up every 
four rounds. If the PCs flee, the mephits do not 
pursue them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have mephit reinforcements arrive each round. To 
decrease the challenge, increase the number of 
rounds it takes for the mephit reinforcements to 
arrive to eight rounds.
D16 . THE DEAD
Beyond the pool of smoking lava is an irregular 
tunnel extending 40 ft. into swirling mists before 
switching back towards the west. At the end of the 
western tunnel lie five or six bodies in a heap. The 
bodies are all grey-skinned dwarves and most have 
fatal burns. A few, though, have empty cavities in 
their abdomens, as if something ate its way out 
from the inside.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: After the derro breached the wall in Room 
D14, those not killed outright by the lava fled here. 
Most of the derro succumbed to their burns, but a 
few tried to dig their way free. Before they were able 
to make much progress, the xill eggs hatched inside 
them and the pupae ate their way free. Nothing 
lives here now.
PCs find nothing of value on the bodies. Most 
dropped their tools in their haste to get away from 
the danger. A PC succeeding a DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check discovers bloody scratches on the 
wall. Written in Undercommon, the markings read, 
“From within...”
Encounter Condition: Fear 18

Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A few tools are scattered about the Room, 
but nothing of value is found here.

D17 . BARRIER
The door to this room is closed.
This short mineshaft extends 8 feet before ending at 
a wall of natural stone.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Souiji wards the door leading to the derro 
encampment and storage facilities by concealing 
the door with the lost door feature of guards and 
wards. An arcane lock also protects the door. Even 
if the PCs manage to remove both magical wards, 
they still need to bypass the mechanical lock and 
the trap to get through. Finally, touching the door 
triggers the alarm, alerting Souiji to the presence of 
intruders.
 '
Arcane Locked Iron Door. Open: DC 25 Dexterity; hit 
points 60 to break (triggers trap below)
 '
Door Trap. Detect: DC 25 Wisdom (Perception); 
Disable: DC 20 Dexterity; 5-ft. radius poisonous 
fumes if triggered; DC 18 Constitution saving throw 
or take 3d6 damage and maximum hit points are 
reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken 
until the end of the next long rest.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If Souiji did not hear the sounds of combat 
in Room D13, touching the door alerts him to the 
presence of intruders. He orders the derro scouts 
sharing his quarters to take positions in the hall-
way using darkness for cover and to conceal the 
entrance to Room D19. Souiji casts his power-up 
suite of spells in preparation. These derro do not 
leave the safety of their tunnels nor do they retreat 
to Room D18. 
The stone giants, if they invade, do not detect 
this door until Day 6. If the PCs explore this area 
after this day, the door is shattered.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the poison with a cloudkill trap. To decrease 
the challenge, change the poison trap to a confusion 
trap (save DC 15).
D18 . STORAGE CAVE
This thirty-foot egg-shaped room is free of the 
pervasive fog polluting many of the nearby 
corridors and rooms. Crates, barrels, boxes and 
sacks lie in a haphazard jumble. Many of the 
contents spill out onto the floor, revealing grains, 
wine bottles, a few weapons and tools. Aside from 
the flight of a frightened spider, nothing moves.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The renegade derro stored their sup-
plies here until yellow mold became problematic. 
Chtrax’s servants, unable to dislodge the renegade 
derro, contaminated a small store of supplies with 
yellow mold spores and placed them in a lightly 
guarded room for the derro to raid. The renegade 
derro, thoroughly insane, overlooked how easy it 
was to gain access to the goods, and in triumph 
brought them back to Souiji. Placing the purloined 
swag in their warm storage chamber, they promptly 
forgot about it. After a few weeks, the yellow mold 
spores quickly took over the room, killing a few 
careless derro. Souiji, seeing the gift as another 
blessing from his goddess, carefully constructed a 
trap, while removing the salvageable supplies. Now 
the yellow mold has expanded to cover the entire 
room, concealed by a permanent minor illusion (he 
cast it from a stolen scroll), depicting the actual 
equipment but concealing the threat of the mold.
PCs wishing to disbelieve the illusion must 
succeed a DC 19 Wisdom save to see the mold fills 
each 5-ft. space along the perimeter of the Room. 
PCs touching any of the items disturb the con-
cealed yellow mold, causing a 5-ft. area to burst 
into a 10-ft. cloud of spores. All PCs in the area of 
effect must succeed a DC 15 Constitution save to 
resist the effects of the mold or take 1d6 points of 
Constitution damage. One minute later, regardless 
of whether the PC saved or not, the victim must 
succeed a second DC 15 Constitution save or take 
2d6 points of Constitution damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Derro do not come to this room except to 
toss more junk inside from a safe distance. There-
fore, any noise in this area makes the derro in 
Room D19 suspicious, causing them to take up de-
fensive positions as described in Room D17, if they 
had not already done so.

291
Treasure: The mold ruined all of the perishable goods 
in the room. All of the tools, weapons, and armor 
are ruined. A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, 
triggering the mold, uncovers a ceramic bottle. In 
it is an unlabeled potion of fire resistance. The label, 
written in Dwarven, identifies the type of potion.
Scaling: N/A
D19 . RENEGADE DERRO WARREN
This unusually shaped natural cavern has a sour 
stench of charcoal. The ceiling rises over 60 ft. 
high, and a cloud of smoke hangs there unmoving. 
Holes in the floor give off streams of foul smoke, 
strangely sweet. To the right is a large cleft in the 
rock, where a few clay pots, crates and barrels 
clutter the area in a jumble. There is no fog here, 
and there are no visible exits.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This cave is Souiji’s lair and campsite 
for his loyal renegade derro. When Chtrax seized 
control over the derro mines for his own purpos-
es, some of the derro refused to serve him. These 
derro, led by the savant Souiji, fled to the empty 
mines in the western section of this region. From 
here, they mount sporadic guerrilla raids to disrupt 
Chtrax’s operations. They have had minimal impact 
on the efforts, instead drawing formian guards 
into their complex to fall victim to the nasty traps 
protecting them.
PCs may believe that because Souiji and his 
followers fight against Chtrax, they may have an ally 
here. Nothing is further from the truth. Souiji is a 
lunatic. He sees the PCs as a threat to his control 
and eventual power grab.
 Souiji is always here. He uses his map of ward-
ing to defend his section of the tunnels once per 
day. He knows he only has a few charges left, and 
when the map runs dry, so do his defenses. The 
savant keeps eight derro guards with him at all 
times. Souiji, paranoid as ever, also cast alarm on 
Room D19, so any tampering with the door mental-
ly alerts him.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If Souiji is aware of the PCs, as is likely if they 
enter through Room D17, he orders the elite derro 
guards to take up positions in the hall and conceal 
themselves with darkness. Souiji then casts the 
following spells in this order: shield, spider climb, 
and resistance. He crawls up the wall to a hidden 
nook above the entrance to this cave, where he 
has cover. 
The derro in the hall hide in the concealing 
darkness. When the PCs enter the area, the derro 
ambush the opponents. The elite derro guards are 
more frightened by Souiji than they are of the PCs 
and will fight to the death. 
The giants, after Day 2, do not immediately de-
tect this concealed section of tunnels, only discov-
ering it on Day 6. Once discovered, 3 stone giants, 
a formian taskmaster, 2 dominated destrachan and 
3 formian warriors break through the door at Room 
D18 and attack Souiji and his minions. If the PCs 
are not present for this confrontation, assume the 
giants win.
Treasure: Piled in the cleft are boxes, barrels and 
crates all containing dry goods and water. A thor-
ough search of the area, DC 20 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check, reveals a small cache of gemstones, 
stolen from the mines. All of the gems are rough 
cut, but if polished and finished, their value dou-
bles. The stones include the following: irregular 
MAP OF WARDING
This scroll of vellum is simple and 
unadorned, creased from folding. Each 
warding map has 50 charges, just like a 
wand, and when all 50 charges are used, 
the map disintegrates. The user can 
draw on the map with any implement 
once per day, taking 30 minutes and ex-
pending a charge from the item. For the 
map of warding to work, the map must 
replicate the layout of the section. At 
the end of the activation time, the map 
creates an effect identical to guards and 
wards (spell save DC 15). The illustrator 
makes all determinations of the spell as 
if he had cast the spell himself.

292
freshwater pearl (14 gp), bloodstone (89 gp), amber 
(109 gp) and a black opal (1,056 gp).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give +2 to Souiji’s spell save DC and spell attack 
rolls, and give him an additional 4 sorcery points. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the number of elite 
derro guards from eight to four.
D20 . DERRO ENCAMPMENT
If the miners did not hear the sounds of combat with 
the ankhegs in Room D13, read the following:
Two feeble campfires burning on either side of this 
cave light the wide, mist-filled room. To the left 
huddle six blue-skinned dwarves, clearly derro. To 
your right is a small crowd of dwarves, some with 
grey features, while others are pale and bald. Only 
the derro speak to one another, while the dwarves 
are silent with heads bowed. In the center of the 
room is a loose pile of large anthropomorphic 
insect heads, their blank eyes watching the cave’s 
entrance. The room stinks with fear.
If the PCs encountered the derro in this room in 
Room D13 instead, read the following:
This wide room is quiet. Standing in the shifting 
mist are six bedraggled and hungry duergar and 
one slender and bald deep dwarf. All the dwarves 
wear bloody rags, and most have filthy bandages 
covering a wound or stump. They watch you with 
cold eyes and grim expressions.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room houses the rebel derro min-
ing encampment, consisting of four derro, three 
duergar, and six deep dwarves. Souiji keeps all 
derro rebels he does not fully trust with the slaves, 
forcing them to share living quarters. The savant’s 
suspicions are ungrounded and the product of his 
insanity; none of these dwarves or derro has the will 
or the ability to hatch a plot against their rene-
gade master.
The derro collect the heads of formian warriors 
and workers, dumping them in the middle of this 
room to serve as a demarcation line the slaves 

293
cannot cross. This is an arbitrary border. Neither 
side is better, and all live in abject squalor.
If the PCs attracted the attention of the derro by 
their combat with the ankheg in Room D13, then 
this room houses just the dwarven slaves. All but 
one of the slaves carries a xill egg in their stomachs, 
and they know it dooms them, having seen many of 
their numbers succumb to the hatching. Souiji has 
promised to cure those slaves who work hard and 
prove their worth. Derro guards take those slaves 
meeting his criteria to Room D18, where the guards 
dump the poor slaves into the yellow mold, Souiji’s 
cure. Even though the slaves have not seen any of 
their number returned, the other derro claim the 
savant granted the slaves freedom and healing for 
their loyalty. Consequently, the slaves are fanatically 
loyal to the savant and see him as the means for 
their salvation.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Shifts change at 12-hour intervals, and the 
derro and slaves move to Rooms D22, D23 and D24, 
where they relieve the other derro and their slaves. 
The shift change takes one minute for the relief 
to reach the other miners and one minute for the 
relieved to return to Room D20. During this time, 
the derro encampment is empty.
If the derro hear the PCs advance, they order the 
slaves to take up their picks and attack the intrud-
ers. Meanwhile, all the derro hide in their darkness 
effects on the first round, awaiting the opportunity 
to strike dealing sneak attack damage.
If the PCs did not draw the derro from this room 
into the fight at Room D13, the derro have disad-
vantage on their Perception checks, while the slaves 
are too tired and demoralized to bother listening. 
Meanwhile, all the derro hide in their darkness 
effects the first round, awaiting the opportunity to 
strike, dealing sneak attack damage.
If the PCs defeated the derro from this room 
in the ankheg battle, the slaves take up their picks 
and ready themselves for the attack. PCs entering 
the room have one round to make a DC 20 Charis-
ma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) check 
to improve the slaves’ attitude. If the PCs fail, the 
dwarf slaves attack, fighting to the death.
Finally, if the PCs do not explore this room until 
Day 3 or later, they find the bodies of all of the 
opponents normally encountered here, slaughtered 
by the giants.
Treasure: Aside from a pile of formian heads, there 
are 4 extra heavy pikes, 2 warhammers and a hand 
axe in a wheelbarrow, hidden beneath a tarp made 
of cured yrthak hide (50 gp value).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add two more derro and give each duergar 
and deep dwarf a use of the Action Surge ability. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of 
derro by two.
D21 . SUPPLY ROOM
The narrow tunnel extends 40 ft before sharply 
turning to the right, where it ends in a small cave, 
no larger than 10 ft wide, filled with junk. Bars 
of corroded silver, bolts of stained cloth, axe, 
hammers, picks and other mining equipment fills 
the outer edge of the room, leaving a narrow island 
in the sea of trash. There are no visible exits, and 
the room is otherwise unoccupied.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The derro and slave miners, from Room 
D20 and Rooms D22 through D24, use this cave for 
storage. Most of the equipment here is worthless, 
except the silver bars and a few hidden items. The 
derro do not guard this room and only come here 
to drop off broken pieces of equipment or unusable 
items acquired from a raid.
Encounter Condition: [Deep Darkness]
Tactics: PCs exploring this room do not draw atten-
tion to themselves unless they make an inordinate 
amount of racket, causing a derro from Room D20 
to investigate. This is a good place for the PCs to 
rest, heal and recover spells, with only a 10% chance 
each day of a Random Encounter. 
Treasure: The piles of equipment contain all manner 
of useless items, including, but not restricted to 
the following: hempen rope 500 ft., seven barrels 
of tepid water, an empty bucket, six hammers, ten 
miner’s picks, four spades and a scrap of parchment 
providing a rough sketch of Room D32 through 
Room D51, though there are no notes, scale or any 
useful information aside from just the layout. In 
addition, there are 10 1-lb. trade bars of truesilver, 
worth 50 gp each, wrapped in treated Formian 
chitin to protect them. If mortals handle the bars, 
their touch transmutes the metal into mundane 
silver. Finally, buried beneath the equipment are

Dwarven Allies
The PCs could befriend and gain the help of liberated slaves throughout the region. Having 20 
or more dwarven soldiers at their sides could mean a significant difference in the survival rate 
throughout the adventure. However, before the PCs build an army of ex-slaves to overthrow the 
evil masters, there are a few issues to consider first.
Xill Eggs: There is a 25% chance any given duergar or deep dwarf carries a xill egg. As the process 
of gaining the egg is maddening, along with the realization of death’s immediacy, many dwarves 
go insane. Consequently, add +20 to the alignment roll if the dwarf has been infected. See Xill 
Eggs and the Derro above for more details.
Alignment: Unless the PCs are of matching alignment, they may have some difficulties convincing 
the slaves to join their cause, by dint of alignment alone. Deep dwarves are “often” lawful neutral 
or just neutral, making them more amenable to the PCs actions than the “usually” lawful evil 
duergar (although a Lawful Evil dwarf might be happy to follow a strong leader who promises 
revenge). To determine the alignment of a particular liberated slave, roll on the following tables.

83-90Chaotic Good94-96Chaotic Evil 
91 -98Chaotic Neutral97-99Chaotic Neutral
99+Chaotic Evil100+Chaotic Good
Loyalty: Chtrax uses propaganda and fear to coerce the slaves to work hard and face the innumer-
able dangers of these mines. As a result, most of the slaves are blind to the deception of their 
xill and formian masters. To enlist a dwarf as an ally, a PC must make a Charisma (Deception) 
or Charisma (Persuasion) check. Make these checks in secret. Dwarves whose attitudes change 
to helpful are willing to join the PCs. Dwarves whose attitudes are friendly may offer advice. 
Other results indicate the dwarves do not help. If more slaves are helpful than the rest, all of the 
dwarves present help the PCs, though those whose attitudes are unfriendly or worse betray the 
PCs and their traitorous brethren at their nearest convenience. If the PCs are willing to arm the 
slaves, give the PC making the Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check advantage 
on the roll.
Possessions: Most dwarves carry light picks and hammers, wear no armor, and have rags for 
clothes. It is up to the PCs to outfit these allies adequately if they wish their assistance.
Combat: Recordkeeping for combats involving 20 or more combatants can be nightmarish for a 
GM. You could simply roll for groups of slaves, pooling their health and reducing their damage 
as you might for a swarm. You could gloss over damage, and have the allies aid cinematically, de-
scribing many more enemies than a room possesses, and the allies hold them off while the PCs 
combat the creatures actually mentioned in the Encounter description. Finally, you could simply 
disallow allies from joining the PCs in combat, providing only advice, rest, etc.

D22 . MINERS
When the PCs enter the tunnel leading to Room D22, 
read the following:
The darkened tunnel features the same clinging 
mists so pervasive in these tunnels and continues 
deep into the darkness. Ahead, clangs of tools on 
stone sound and echo down the tunnel. Amidst the 
calls of the hammers and picks, you hear voices, 
and then a weird humming noise jarring your 
bones. Just as soon as the noise starts, the roar of 
crumbling rock masks it.
When the PCs approach the entrance, read the 
following:
This gloomy cavern is clearly a mining work site. 
Derro overseers monitor the efforts of several 
slaves who chip away the dense rock in the many 
shallow mines. The source of the unusual noise is 
clear, now, as a derro with a spear prods a chained 
destrachan toward another small tunnel. The room 
is dark but lacks the clinging mists of the tunnel.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This cave is the heart of the renegade 
derro miners. Souiji, though unaware of Chtrax’s 
true goals, knows the xill searches for something 
in the mines. In a vain effort to defeat his neme-
sis, Souiji directs the derro under his command to 
mine the tunnels in the hopes they can beat Chtrax 
to his goal. Given their position in the complex, the 
derro have thus far broken through the outer walls, 
releasing lava into the tunnels (see Rooms D11 and 
D14). This has collapsed several tunnels, killing 
many slaves and derro, and the derro are now likely 
to break through to some of the rooms under the 
xill’s control. Two days after the PCs first enter this 
complex, the rebel derro break through to Room 
D27 as described in the opening sidebar.
Before this time, however, five derro overseers  
command five duergar and four deep dwarves 
to work the tunnels in the Room. In addition to 
the slave forces, the derro also control a moody 
destrachan, using it to break up particularly dense 
sections of rock. There are two miners per alcove, 
including Room D23. A bulette and its derro han-
dler work the tunnel at Room D24.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 8
Tactics: The derro command the slaves, whose loyalty 
is thanks to Souiji’s promises (see Room D20 for 
details as to why), to attack the PCs. The handler 
in Room D24 releases his pet bulette as soon as 
combat breaks out in Room D22. The derro use poi-
soned crossbow bolts from positions of darkness. 
The destrachan uses the PCs attack to get revenge 
on its captors. Each round it is 50% likely to attack 
the derro and their slaves or the PCs. If the PCs 
attack the destrachan, it focuses its attack on them 
exclusively. If combat goes against the miners, 
dwarf slaves fall back to the two tunnels at room 
D23 in an effort to lure them to an unstable corri-
dor. All of the miners fight to the death.
On Day 2, the slaves break through the wall 
to Room D27, creating a permanent connection 
between the two rooms. The stone giant chief 
invades the Old Mines with 3 regular stone giants, 
a formian taskmaster and 3 formian warriors to 
destroy the problematic derro. See Room O27 for 
more details.
If explored on Day 3 or later, the room holds 
nothing but corpses.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one destrachan and replace the deep 
dwarf slaves with duergar fighters. To decrease the 
challenge, replace the duergar miners with deep 
dwarf miners.
D23 . UNSTABLE TUNNEL
This tunnel ends after 15 ft Spider web cracks cover 
both walls and ceiling here.
Initial Attitude: N/A or Hostile
Encounter: Two slaves, a duergar and deep dwarf  
normally work this tunnel. The dwarves have 
warned their masters of the danger in the tun-
nels, but the derro make them work it anyway. Any 
loud noise, such as that created by fireball or ice 
storm, causes the tunnel to collapse. Should the 
ceiling collapse, the cave-in deals 24 (8d6) points of 

296
bludgeoning damage, or half on a successful DC 15 
Dexterity save.
A PC succeeding a DC 20 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) can identify weakened ceilings for 
what they are.
Encounter Condition: Poor Footing 4, Hazardous 
Footing 18, Tremors 18
Tactics: If combat goes against the miners in Room 
D22, a slave retreats to this tunnel in a mad act of 
sacrifice. Should the PCs follow, a derro uses its 
psychic thunderwave to collapse the tunnel, bring-
ing it down on himself and the PCs. The dwarves 
realize they are doomed, and feel their loyalty lies 
with Souiji.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N.A
D24 . CHAINED BULETTE AND ITS 
MASTER
If combat does not occur in Room D22, read the 
following:
A cloud of dust and the sounds of scraping pours 
out of this tunnel. Through the flying debris, a 
large, armored beast claws at the rock, while an 
exceptionally mad derro looks on, a wide smile 
staining his face. Neither the beast nor the derro 
notice you.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A bulette and its derro handler work this 
short tunnel. The derro handler has a tenuous con-
trol over the monster, forced to devote his entire 
attention on goading the bulette to dig through 
the derro’s use of the animal friendship spell. The 
noise the monster makes as it digs is deafening, 
so the derro is unlikely to hear any disturbances or 
disruptions.
The bulette is loud in its work, deafening all 
creatures within 10 ft. for as long as they remain in 
the area. Note, deafened PCs suffer a -4 penalty to 
initiative checks, automatically fail Wisdom (Percep-
tion) checks, and have a 20% chance of spell failure 
when casting spells with verbal components.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises 8, Echoes 4
Tactics: If combat occurs in Room D22, allow the 
derro handler a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check 
to notice each round. Should he succeed this check, 
he turns from the bulette to investigate. Allow the 
bulette a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to no-
tice when something breaks the handler’s attention. 
If the monster succeeds, it attacks its handler and 
leaps into the thickest group of combatants, killing 
PCs, derro and slaves alike.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give the handler an additional attack and disallow 
the bulette from attacking its allies. To decrease 
the challenge, have the bulette immediately notice 
the handler’s distraction. Instead of having it enter 
the melee, it burrows away after killing its for-
mer master.

D25 - D31 . THE APPROACH
Rooms D25 through D31 serve as the only path to the 
Chtrax enclave. A mixture of lairs, checkpoints and 
even a foundry, this path is exceedingly dangerous. 
It is fraught with hostile derro, formians and giants, 
and the PCs’ successes or failures here determine 
the reactions of the rest of this Region. Yet, despite 
this section’s importance to Chtrax’s overall plan, 
his bulwarks are failing as evidenced by the corpses 
of derro in Room D25 and the malfunctioning trap 
at Room D26.
There are far fewer traps in these sections, as Chtrax’s 
resources are flagging, forcing him to rely on the 
stone giant chief to defend the back door to his op-
erations. Still, the xill master barely trusts the giant, 
so he commands a myrmarch to dispatch regular 
formian patrols through these areas. These threats, 
along with the occasional creeping xill, combine to 
make the approach a dangerous path.
If the PCs have not vanquished the renegade derro 
in the Old Mines by Day 2, the miners in D22 break 
through the wall to Room D27. There, the stone giant 
chief leads an expedition to kill the rogue derro, 
bringing 3 more stone giants, a formian taskmaster 
and 3 formian warriors to the fight, leaving this room 
empty of hostiles until Day 4, when the stone giant 
returns. If the PCs have still not defeated the stone 
giant chieftain by Day 6, he returns to the Old Mines 
to kill Souiji.
When the PCs first enter this section, they must suc-
ceed a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the 
loud slamming noise caused by the malfunctioning 
trap in Room D26. From Room D27, they must suc-
ceed a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the 
hammering noises from the factory at Room D30.
All rooms here are cloistered unless specified other-
wise. Throughout this area are hewn stone walls with 
average ceiling heights of 30 ft. in rooms and 15 ft. in 
tunnels. Debris in the tunnels gathers at the edges in 
collections of small rocks, trash, scraps of cloth and 
luminescent fungi. The scent of smoke lingers in the 
air and wisps of it are visible near the ceilings.

D25 . PLAYED OUT MINE
Rounding the corner, you come upon a grisly heap 
of corpses. Worse, all have open cavities in their 
chests. Bloody footprints mark the passage leading 
back in the direction you came before they fade 
away completely.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This was once a derro checkpoint, respon-
sible for defending the approach from intruders. 
Chtrax implanted his eggs in these guards and 
a couple of days ago they hatched. The surviving 

298
derro fled, but the renegade derro or traps 
killed them all.
Searching the bodies uncovers precious 
little. Someone already looted the bodies, 
so they have no treasure. A DC 20 Intel-
ligence (Arcana) check identifies their 
deaths were caused by the hatch-
ing of xill eggs. There is nothing 
else that is of interest. From here 
the PCs can hear the malfunc-
tioning trap (smashing stones) 
in Room D26.

D26 . MALFUNCTIONING 
TRAP
The source of the awful din comes 
from this 30-ft.-long corridor. From 
the ceiling, a huge 5-ft.-by-5-ft.-by 10 
ft. stone block drops and slams into the 
floor making a terrible racket, sending 
clouds of rock dust in the air. Soon after it 
falls, it will rise back up into the darkness, 
while another block falls, randomly. Bloody 
stains, broken bits of bone and teeth, and 
several flattened corpses litter the floor here.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This trap is broken. When working prop-
erly, mere passage down the tunnel would trigger 
the trap, causing blocks to fall onto unsuspecting 
intruders. A secret lever on either side of the trap, 
when pulled, would disable it. Now, however, 
the levers on both sides are broken and the trap 
triggers at random. For four hours each day, the 
trap stops functioning, allowing passage into the 
Great Hall.
Each round, roll 1d12 to determine which 5 ft. 
section malfunctions and triggers the trap auto-
matically. In addition, whenever a PC stands in 
any of the 5 ft. sections of the hall, there is a 50% 
chance for the trap to trigger.
 '
Falling Block Trap. Detect: DC 25 Wisdom (Percep-

+10 to hit, 12 (4d6) bludgeoning damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: No creatures will come to investigate the 
trap. However, if the PCs disable the trap, 1d3 stone 
giants from Room D27 (unless it is Day 2 or 6) come 
to investigate the odd silence.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the trap trigger 75% of the time and have the 
blocks deal 6d6 points of damage. To decrease the 
challenge, have the sections trigger their respective 
traps just once.

D27 . STONE GIANT QUARTERS
This large cavern is nearly 40 ft. across, with 
a dripping ceiling 50 ft. above. Boulders litter 
the floor, along with the skins of an unspecified 
enormous reptile. Through the gloom, you think you 
see blankets, a few overlarge crates and a fire pit 
radiating light.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This large cave houses the stone giants in 
service to the xill. Most times Talig and 1d6 stone 
giants recline here, relaxing and entertaining them-
selves while biding their time before rising against 
their newest masters. While they wait, they fre-
quently kill lone derro in revenge for their years of 
captivity and hide the bodies under a pile of loose 
rocks. These giants are not immediately hostile, 
though they attack if they sense an easy opponent 
for the sheer enjoyment of the act.
The stone giants have maintained a presence in 
these mines. Before Chtrax, the derro had en-
slaved them as a labor force. When Chtrax assumed 
control, however, he approached them as equals in-
stead of in the more traditional hierarchy of a mas-
ter-slave relationship. The xill approached the elder 
stone giant, Talig, and lied, requesting the giant’s 
assistance in recovering a lost artifact. The giant 
agreed on the promise of power in return and see-
ing the puny outsider as no immediate threat. The 
stone giant elder offered his stone giant minions to 
serve as laborers and guards to survey the progress 
of the artifact’s recovery. Talig ordered his minions 
to seize the object as soon as the derro and their 
workers uncover it. By positioning stone giants 
throughout the complex, Talig expects an easy vic-
tory over the xill. Until Chtrax recovers the artifact, 
the giants are content to work, watch and wait.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises 7, Echoes 10
Tactics: The giants are wary of trespassers, like soli-
tary derro, moving to and from Room D28 through 
Room D26, so when the PCs enter this room, the 
giants know. While not overtly hostile, because they 
feel the PCs do not represent a threat to them, they 
are suspicious. They watch from hidden positions 
among the rocks. If the party is small, they attack 
by hurling boulders until the PCs close. Otherwise, 
they allow well-armed PCs to pass unmolested. If 
the PCs explore this room, however, Talig steps into 
view and questions why they intrude. Respectful 
PCs succeeding at a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) 
check improve the giants’ attitudes to being friend-
ly. If they manage this, the giants give them the 
following information if asked. If the PCs succeed a 
DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check, the giants give 
the following information freely. Otherwise, they 
simply tell the PCs to move on or die.
A canny, red-skinned devil named Chtrax controls 
the mines now with the help of formians, orderly 
insect men. He commands the surviving derro, their 
slaves and even our brethren to dig into the depths 
to reach some lost artifact. We are not certain as 
to what this artifact is or what it does, but Chtrax 
is adamant about retrieving it. While we serve him 
now, it is out of convenience. Ahead is the Great 
Hall. There the slaves process silver for tools and 
other equipment. Beyond the hall are the deeper 
mines. It is dangerous there, certainly no place for a 
group such as yourselves.
The giants have no interest in helping the PCs, 
and if requested, they refuse. If the PCs are respect-
ful, the giants let them pass freely. Should combat 
occur, Talig takes cover behind the myriad of huge 
rock piles, hurling rocks at the PC spellcasters. The 
other giants in the room close after one round of 
ranged attacks. These giants fight to the death.
If the PCs kill the giants and leave their carcasses 
in the open, the Great Hall has a 20% chance each 
day of going on alert (see below).
Depending on developments in other parts of 
this region, this room may be empty. The renegade 
derro, if undefeated, punch through the wall on 
Day 2. The giants here react by gathering a force 
and wiping out the rebels, leaving this room empty. 
The chieftain returns with 1d3 stone giants on Day 
3, watchful of the new exit. On Day 6, the chief-
tain, if still alive, goes back into the Old Mines to 
kill Souiji.
Treasure: The giants hide their accumulated wealth 
with the bodies of the slain derro in a rock pile. 
Clearing the rock requires 2 hours of hard labor 
and exposes diggers to Slimy Doom, carried by the 
rotting derro. PCs digging must succeed a DC 14 
Constitution save or contract the disease.
PCs succeeding in excavating the treasure find 
1,567 gp divided somewhat equally between three 
leather sacks. In a fourth bag are 6 gems, consisting 
of a tourmaline (800 gp), 2 red spinell (700 gp, 600 

300
gp), zircon (70 gp), onyx (50 gp) and a small shard 
of obsidian (8 gp).
Each stone giant, including the chieftain carries 
a large sack holding 2d12 throwing rocks and 1d4+6 
mundane items.
 '
Slimy Doom. Contact with the substance requires a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw to resist. Incuba-
tion period of 1 day, 1d4 Constitution damage.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the stone giants’ attitudes start as Hostile. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the number of addi-
tional stone giants to 2.
D28 . SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY
Weird lights and ghastly shadows play on the walls 
of this 30 ft. long tunnel. Pounding noise of metal 
clanging on metal echo up ahead, making the 
tunnel inordinately loud. Otherwise, the tunnel is 
as dark as it is ordinary.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This tunnel leads to the sentry post at 
Room D29. There are no creatures here and the 
tunnel is debris-free. PCs clearly hear the sound of 
metalworking and smelting coming from ahead 
in Room D30.
There are too many tracks here to get an accu-
rate read on the types and numbers of creatures 
travelling through this tunnel.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs retreat from the formian and 
gorgon guards in Room D29, and if they did not 
befriend or encounter the giants in Room D27, the 
formians and the stone giants trap the PCs here, 
flanking them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D29 . GUARDS
The tunnel takes a sharp turn to the left, opening 
into a small room serving as an antechamber for a 
larger cavern. Mounted on two armor-plated bulls 
with green mist curling from their nostrils and 
dead empty eyes, are two insect men, each holding 
a guisarme.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Functioning as guards overseeing traf-
fic coming from Room D27 and beyond to enter 
Rooms D30 and the Great Hall are two formian 
warriors mounted on gorgons. These creatures are 
vigilant about their duties, allowing only 
stone giants, derro, and dwarves to pass into 
D30 without question. They are watchful for 
intruders, cautious about creatures they do 
not recognize and readily attack any who 
threaten the complex.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs have 1 round to make their case 
to these guards to avert combat, by succeed-
ing a DC 25 Charisma (Deception), Charis-
ma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) 
check. PCs suffer a -5 penalty, as the guards 
are exceptionally suspicious. If combat 
sounded from Room D27, the guards attack 
without question.
One gorgon uses its breath weapon, 
while the other tramples into combat. The 
formian warriors attack PC using their 
polearms. On the second round of com-
bat, one of the mounted formians urges its 
mount to charge surviving PCs, while the 
other uses its breath weapon attack. There-
after, the formians and gorgons use charge 
attacks and attacks with reach weapons 
until the gorgons’ respective breath weap-
ons recharge.
Combat with any formian alerts all form-
ians in the region due to their hive mind 
ability, though only those nearest the threat 
respond. Consequently, fighting the form-
ians here alerts those in the factory and the 
Great Hall.

301
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the formian warriors’ hit points by 10 each. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the guards to two 
formian warriors and one gorgon.
D30 . FACTORY
This gallery houses a major operation. Scores 
of derro work at various tables and forges, 
constructing weapons, tools, carts and rails. More 
insect men stand at locations throughout the room, 
overseeing the operation. In the center of the room 
is a stone golem, obviously built from petrified 
humanoids. A crucible, where liquid iron and 
other metals bubble, spitting sparks and belching 
toxic fumes, lights the room with an inconsistent 
warmth. Ahead, another tunnel leads to a large 
cavern with several buildings and attendant 
toiling slaves.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The factory is where the derro work 
raw materials into useable items. Here they forge 
tools, weapons, ore cars, tracks, spikes, and braces 
for tunnel ceilings out of the corrupted truesil-
ver and iron. Twenty infected derro work in this 

302
room. Chtrax does not trust the slaves to handle 
the viral manufacturing needed to keep his excava-
tion moving. As a result, only derro work here and 
only under constant guard of six formian warriors 
and a stone golem, to ensure against sabotage or 
intrusion.
 The formians are wary of intruders. They 
question any non-derro entering the room. Unless 
a formian, stone giant or Chtrax accompany and 
vouch for the PC, the formians attack.
Encounter Condition: Hostile
Tactics: If PCs battle the sentries in Room D29, the 
golem and half of the formians move to Room D29 
to aid the guards, while the remaining formians go 
to Room D31 and ready an action to tip the crucible 
of molten ore to spill into the room once all the PCs 
enter. The derro climb on top of their worktables, 
using darkness for concealment and level cross-
bows at the room’s entrance, firing as soon as they 
see the PCs.
When the PCs enter the room, the formians 
and the derro at room D31 tip the crucible, spilling 
liquid metal over the whole floor. PCs on foot take 
8d6 points of fire damage each round they remain 
in the liquid metal, no save. The derro avoid the 
damage because the worktables hang on chains 
suspended from the ceiling. The metal cools after 
20 minutes. The formians in room D32 hold their 
positions, waiting for the intruders to enter the 
Great Hall.
Treasure: This room is home to over one hundred 
hammers, picks, shovels and an assortment of 
mining tools, though none are valuable enough to 
warrant plundering. There are also 24 short swords, 
15 warhammers and 18 light maces. Finally, there 
are over 300 spikes, three huge ore carts, and 200 
ft. of linear track.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the number of wailing golems by 
one. To decrease the challenge, remove the form-
ian warriors.
D31 . FOUNDRIES
A crucible hanging from an iron frame and filled 
with bubbling molten metal dominates this alcove. 
Beneath it burns a white-hot fire, fed by jets of gas 
from numerous holes set into the walls. All around 
this area are barrels containing water. Some 
derro climb a ladder leading up to the bowl and 
drop broken weapons, tools, chants of ore, and on 
occasion, a squeaking rat into the molten mixture, 
while others dip smaller crucibles attached to long 
poles to withdraw a portion and pour it into the 
casts at the base.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This is where five derro smelt the raw 
metals into a liquid state and add enough adaman-
tine to make it as strong as steel.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The formian warriors in Room D30 move to 
this area to tip the crucible and cover the floor with 
flaming metal. Tipping the crucible is simple, re-
quiring a pull of a lever. The formians take positions 
on the ladders, using ranged attacks against the 
PCs. Near the water barrels is a stack of repeating 
light crossbows. At the first sign of trouble, each 
derro grabs one and moves to a position of cover, if 
any, before firing. 
Pouring hot metal onto the floor causes the 
water barrels to burst, resulting in billows of steam. 
All creatures in this room gain concealment (20% 
miss chance) from the obscured vision. There is no 
way to tamper with the gas jets fueling the fire. PCs 
unlucky enough to find themselves in the inferno 
take 20d6 points of fire damage and automatically 
catch fire. To put themselves out, they must make a 
DC 15 Dexterity save.
Treasure: Though none of the derro have any person-
al treasure, they do possess ten 1-lb. bars of ada-
mantine, each worth 50 gp.

303
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage dealt by the liquid metal to 
20d6. To decrease the challenge, do not allow the 
crucible to be tipped.
D32- D51 . GREAT HALL
This section is the central nervous system of the 
complex, comprised of Rooms D32-D51. This is an 
enormous cavern, over 200 ft. wide and with a ceiling 
towering 100 ft. overhead. Nine buildings dominate 
the center of the cavern. Several of these structures 
feature connecting ramps and tracks leading to other 
buildings and ultimately the track at Room D51. 
Three balconies overlook the workings, while the two 
major entrances feature more guards. Filling this 
vast gallery are stone giants, derro, xill and more, too 
numerous to count. In short, a direct confrontation is 
tantamount to suicide.
The massive bore dominates the Hall. Four stone 
giants push the handles to pull the truesilver out of 
the earth. The extracted truesilver climbs the helical 
thread with each turn, until it reaches the platform 
at the top. There, derro workers use force clamps to 
retrieve the ore and place it into large metal carts. A 
fifth stone giant pushes the cart to a conveyer car-
rying the metal to the separation room, where the 
slaves separate the ore from the rock before send-
ing the truesilver on to the refinery. In this room, 
slaves heat the truesilver and form it into bars where 
they are loaded onto palettes. Stone giants carry the 
palettes to the wheeled carts, depositing them into 
the gnome’s lab in Room D53. The slaves move the 
separated rock to Room D37, where an yrthak uses its 
sonic lance to pulverize it into gravel, so the dwarves 
can easily dump it in lava flow.
Chtrax uses the Great Hall as his command center, 
where he oversees operations in the mines, from dis-
cussing security issues with his myrmarch captain to 
inspecting the extraction process, to checking on the 
various excavation sites. In all, Chtrax keeps a close 
eye on his servants’ progress, and he does so from 
this quasi-cockpit.
If the PCs fight any formians before entering this 
place, the entire cavern is put on alert because of the 
hive mind link between formians. Each room below 
details normal encounters and encounters when 
alert. In addition, each room also details what rein-
forcements, if any, arrive to aid their beleaguered 
allies. Even though many rooms list the number of 
formian warriors as they arrive in waves, there are 
only so many formian warriors. The Great Hall has 
30 unattached formian warriors, 10 unattached elite 
formian warriors and 2 unattached formian taskmas-
ters. Each time the PCs engage in a combat in one of 
the Great Hall’s rooms, they undoubtedly draw more 
formians to their position as indicated in the room’s 
description. The formian warrior reinforcements 
number 30. After all 30 formian warriors or formian 
taskmasters arrive or fall, no more arrive. You could 
move formian warriors from other encounter sites to 
engage the PCs, but those formians are under orders 
to protect their respective rooms. Regardless, the 
Great Hall resumes its normal activity after one hour 
lapses (unless the PCs kill or rout everyone).
Chtrax remains in the Great Hall from Day 0 until 
Day 3. Later, he moves to Room D58 after the tar-
rasque reaches the first adamantine bands. Thereafter 
he has a 10% chance to be in a random room in the 
Great Hall, a 50% chance of being in Room D78 and 
a 40% chance to be inspecting the mines in Rooms 
D78 to Room D80.
Destroying the myrmarch in Room D39 or the phy-
lactery in Room D49 changes the dynamics of the 
section. If the PCs kill the myrmarch, formians in the 
Great Hall, the Approach, and the Old Mines suffer a 
-2 penalty to attacks, saves and skill checks and lose 
their hive mind ability Destroying the phylactery, 
however, removes the hive mind ability from all the 
formians in the region, telling them their queen is 
dead. The formians stay in their respective locations 
attacking any non-formians encountered, including 
the giants, derro, slaves, xill and PCs. While in this 
enraged state, PCs cannot reason with them. All 
formians fight to the death.
Allow cautious PCs to move unmolested through this 
area if they do nothing to draw attention to them-
selves. There are plenty of places for the PCs to move, 
such as skirting the edge of the cavern, keeping out 
of range of the inhabitants’ darkvision and if they 
avoid combat, they should be fine. Should the PCs 
make a direct assault, let them feel the full weight of 
Chtrax’s power.
Buildings have masonry walls 1 ft. thick. Climb-
ing these walls requires a DC 15 Strength (Athlet-
ics) check.

The Great Hall has a sunken floor, but it is relatively level and free of debris. Unlike most of this section, pur-
plish flames erupt from the floor, lighting the Great Hall. The flames are not hot but offer light equivalent in 
brightness to moonlight. Water extinguishes them for five minutes before drying enough to flare up again.

D32 . SENTRY
Guarding this wide staircase are two insect men 
and a large stone creature, its face chiseled into a 
cruel smile. Behind the guards is a vast cavern filled 
with several buildings and creatures, all working 
near a massive bore, drilling into the heart of the 
earth. Balconies overlook the cavern occupied 
by watchful guards manning ballistae. This is a 
fearsome place, filled with more opponents than 
even the bravest army could hope to overcome.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly or Hostile (if alerted)
Encounter: Guarding this entry are two formian 
warriors and a stone golem. The formian warriors 
vigilantly protect the Great Hall from intruders and 
are even suspicious of derro, with the recent raids 
from the renegades.
Getting past these sentries requires a successful 
DC 20 Charisma (Deception) check (DC 25 if alert-
ed). Combat with these formians puts the Great 
Hall on alert.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs fought the derro and formians in 
room D31, these guards are ready for them, posi-
tioning themselves on either side of the door and 
leaving the stone golem in the middle to block the 
passage into the hall. When the players engage the 
golem, the formian warriors take full attacks on the 
closest PCs.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the number of formian warriors by 
four. To decrease the challenge, remove the form-
ian warriors.
D33 . SEPARATION ROOM
This large building stands between a smaller 
connected building and a ramp descending from 
the platform housing the bore. With no windows 
and only a single door, the plumes of smoke 
rising from stacks on its roof make the structure 
more imposing.
If the PCs enter, read the following text:
Inside, a tracked ramp dumps nuggets of rock 
mixed with glowing metal into bins. Dwarven 
slaves move the full bins to worktables where other 
slaves use odd devices to handle the materials 
and separate the silvery metal from the bare rock. 
Once they separate the metal, they place the pure 
substance on a conveyor to carry it out of the 
room and into the attached building. Clouds of 
dust boil up from the tables, venting through the 
ceiling. Overseeing the entire operation is a large 
ant creature and a derro with a glazed expression 
at its side.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent or Hostile (if alert)
Encounter: A formian taskmaster oversees the sepa-
ration of the truesilver from the rock. At his side is a 
dominated derro overseer. Working the room are 12 
duergar  and 20 deep dwarf slaves.
Encounter Condition: [Stagnant Air], Unhallowed
Tactics: If not alerted to intruders, the taskmaster 
scuttles over to the PCs inquiring of their business. 
To convince the formian they belong, they must 
succeed a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) or Charis-
ma (Intimidation) check. The taskmaster does not 
respond to Persuasion. If the Great Hall is alert, the 
formian alerts his fellow formians through the hive 
mind of the presence of intruders. 
Combat with the formian taskmaster alerts the 
rest of the Great Hall. If alerted, in 1d6 rounds a 
patrol of 1d4 formian warriors arrives to aid the 
combatants against the heroes. More formians 
join the fight every 1d6 rounds thereafter until the 
threat is suitably contained. The reinforcements 
continue until 12 formian warriors have answered 
the call. Then, the formian myrmarch from Room 
D39 arrives to destroy any surviving PCs.
If the PCs or a tremor destroys this building, 
production stops for 1d6 days, as formian workers 
hasten to rebuild the structure. In the meantime, 
the formian myrmarchs confine the slaves to their 
quarters or the formians send the dwarves to work 
in other tunnels.
Treasure: There is a considerable fortune of truesil-
ver in this room, but direct contact by a mortal 
turns it to normal silver. There are 75 pounds of the 
stuff scattered between the bins and the various 
tables, worth over 75,000 gp if the PCs can handle 
it without contaminating it. Otherwise, the silver is 
worth 375 gp.

306
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
decrease the amount of time for reinforcements 
to just 1d3 rounds. To decrease the challenge, 
increase the amount of time for reinforcements to 
2d6 rounds.
D34 . REFINERY
Inside this smaller, attached and windowless 
building, slaves work to melt silver metal taken 
from a conveyor from the adjoining building. 
They then cast the metal into bars. When suitably 
cooled, the slaves load the bars onto low carts, for 
the stone giant to move to yet another structure. 
More insect men watch the slaves’ progress with 
blank and unblinking stares. The room is replete 
with poisonous fumes.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent or Hostile (if alert)
Encounter: Once the slaves separate the ore from the 
rock in Room D33, they send it here on a conveyer 
belt, where ten deep dwarf slaves smelt the ore 
into liquid and cast it into bars, making it easy to 
transport for the gnome in Room D54. Six formian 
warriors are vigilant in the security here, keeping 
alert and watching for treachery. Two stone giant 
laborers load the palettes of bars onto carts and roll 
them to Room D42. This process is extremely slow 
and dangerous.
The fumes from the refining process are toxic. 
As the dwarves are extremely resistant to poison, 
and the formians immune, most are unaffect-
ed. PCs entering this room must succeed DC 15 
Constitution saves or take 1d6 points of Consti-
tution damage from the poisonous atmosphere. 
Ten rounds later, they must succeed a second save, 
regardless of the success or failure of the first, 
against the same DC, or take an additional 1d6 
points of Constitution. This continues for every 10 
rounds they remain in the room and for ten rounds 
after they leave.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the room is alerted, the formian warriors 
notify the other formians in the Great Hall to the 
presence of intruders. Otherwise, the formian 
warriors question the PCs about their presence. PCs 
must succeed a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check 
to convince the formian warriors they belong. On a 
failed check, the warriors ask the PCs to leave. On 
a failed check by 5 or more, the formians warn the 
other formians in the Great Hall of intruders and 
then attack.
The formians command the slaves to attack the 
PCs, though the slaves only fight until half their 
number fall before fleeing. The stone giants hurl 
carts at the PCs, dealing damage as boulders. They 
have enough for two carts apiece. Finally, the form-
ian warriors move to gain flanks against the PCs.
Combat tips off the rest of the Great Hall. If 
alerted, a patrol of 1d4 formian warriors arrives 
in 1d6 rounds to aid the combatants against the 
heroes. The reinforcements continue until a total 
of 12 formian warriors answer the call, and then 
the formian myrmarch from Room D39 arrives to 
destroy any surviving PCs.
If the PCs or a tremor destroys this building, 
refinement moves to the factory at Room D30. If 
the PCs destroyed the factory there, production 
stops altogether for 2d6 days until the formian 
workers can rebuild the structure. In the meantime, 
the formian myrmarchs confine the slaves to their 
quarters or send dwarves to work in other tunnels.
Treasure: There are 50 pounds of truesilver in 
bars and in raw form in this Room. The haul is 
worth over 37,500 gp if the PCs can handle them 
without contamination. Otherwise, the silver is 
worth 250 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
decrease the amount of time for reinforcements to 
just 1d3 rounds. To decrease the challenge, reduce 
the number of stone giants by 1 and increase the 
amount of time for reinforcements to 2d6 rounds.
D35 . TRACKED RAMP
Large cans filled with rock travel down the tracked 
ramp descending from the large platform to end 
inside of an adjacent building.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: An ore cart travels down the ramp once 
per five minutes from Room D39. The ramp itself 
is unguarded. Walking on this ramp reduces a 
PCs speed by half and requires a successful DC 20 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to keep one’s footing. 
A failed check indicates the PC falls on the ramp. A 
failed check by 5 or more indicates the PC fell to the 
floor below, taking 8d6 points of falling damage. 

307
The ore carts are unavoidable, tak-
ing up the whole of the ramp. PCs 
struck by a cart take 2d6 points 
of damage and tumble down the 
ramp into a bin in Room D33.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The ramp has 40 hit points 
and a damage threshold of 10. If 
the PCs or tremors destroy the 
ramp, slaves unload the rock from 
the threads of the bore at Room 
D40 and load it into carts and the 
giants push the carts to Room 
D33. It takes the formian 
workers 1d3 days to 
rebuild this ramp.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D36 . 
TRACK
Two stone 
giants push 
a cart along 
this track. With 
each movement, 
the contents splash and 
run down its sides. Th track 
originates at an angled building and 
ends at the drill site.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: Two stone giants haul grease to the drill 
site. The giants ignore PCs unless they attack or if a 
formian taskmaster commands the giants to attack 
the PCs. If the Great Hall is alert, the giants contin-
ue their business.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs improving the giants’ attitude to Friendly 
or better, which requires a successful DC 15 Cha-
risma (Persuasion) check, convince the giants to 
divulge what they know about the Great Hall. The 
giants know the basic operations in the hall but 
are unfamiliar with anything beyond that. They do 
know formians take injured derro to the Infirmary 
at Room D48. Most derro return, but all notice they 
return changed.
If drawn into a fight, the giants 
are ruthless, having lived under the 
oppressive rule of first the derro and 
then the xill. They use the oppor-
tunity to vent their frustration, by 
hurling a cart at the PCs, dealing 
damage as a thrown rock, before 
they close with slam attacks.
Combat here instantly alerts 
formians warriors, who in turn 
alert the rest of the hall. Every 1d4 
rounds, 1d6 formian warriors arrive, 
continuing until 18 formian war-
riors have arrived. In addi-
tion, the derro sentries at 
Room D45 fire ballista 
bolts at the PCs for 
as long as they 
can see them. 
After six rounds 
of fighting, 
the formian 
myrmarch from 
Room D39 ar-
rives to dispatch 
the remaining 
intruders.
If the PCs or trem-
ors destroy this track, 
slaves carry tubs of grease 
until the formian workers repair 
the track in 1d3 days.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
decrease the amount of time for reinforcements 
to arrive to just 1d2 rounds. To decrease the chal-
lenge, reduce the number of stone giants by 1 and 
increase the amount of time for reinforcements to 
1d8 rounds.
D37 . GRAVEL AND RENDERING SHOP
This angled building is nondescript, featuring two 
entrances. The first is a wide bay, large enough to 
allow the giant exiting to pass without ducking. 
The second is a smaller wooden door. The air here 
stinks of rock dust, mixed with the stench of a 
charnel house.

308
Once inside, read the following:
Inside, the twin purposes of this building become 
abundantly clear. First, a chained, large, winged 
reptile and two blind bipedal creatures with cone-
like mouths shatter rock with a magical sonic 
ability. Derro overseers watch the progress, while 
dwarf slaves drag more large boulders into the 
path of the blasting. Clouds of grey dust swirl into 
the air. It is fair to say the noise is deafening.
The second function of the room is less mundane. 
Corpses of slaves, derro and even giants sit in a pile 
while a weird dinosaur creature hoses them with 
a stream of liquid. Where the fluid falls, the flesh 
breaks down and streams of acrid smoke rise. Four 
masked slaves push the runoff into troughs to carry 
the fluids into a sunken vat. There three more slaves 
stir the mixture with long poles. Occasionally, one 
dips a bucket into the stinking pool to pull forth a 
fresh batch of lubricant.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This building serves to break down rock 
and flesh. The chained creature is an yrthak and the 
others are destrachan. Two derro handlers  watch 
their progress, and 4 deep dwarves shovel the grav-
el into carts to be dragged away at a later time to 
Room D7. The derro and the dwarves are deaf from 
the noise.
On the other side is a digester and his handler. 
The slaves are all deep dwarves. These slaves make 
lubricants for drilling from liquefied carcasses.
If the PCs enter this room, the derro are suspi-
cious but ignore them. As this room lacks a formian 
presence, even if the Great Hall is under direct 
assault, the derro handlers have no way of knowing 
about it without going outside, something they 
only do at shift changes. Consequently, all of the 
creatures here ignore the PCs.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The derro are not interested in conversing 
with PCs. Any questions about the complex, its 
operation or leadership tell the derro the PCs are 
outsiders. Should a fight break out the derro fall 
back and command the others to attack.
Round 1: Derro handlers fall back and fire crossbow 
bolts at the PCs. The digester uses its acid spray 
in a cone effect. The destrachan move to catch the 
PCs in crossfire of destructive harmonics while 
the yrthak uses its sonic lance on the chain hold-
ing it. The slaves flee.
Round 2: Derro handlers fire another barrage of 
poisoned crossbow bolts or use psychic thunder-
wave on groups of PCs. The digester charges the 
nearest living creature, ally or enemy, and at-
tacks using its claws until its acid recharges. The 
destrachan use their destructive harmonics again 
if losing, or if they have the upper hand, switch to 
the nerves effect. The yrthak wings out through 
the wide door and takes to the air, launching 
sonic lance attacks at the various buildings and 
individuals in the Great Hall. The slaves flee 
to room D42.
Round 3: If the combat goes against the derro 
and their minions, they create darkness and flee, 
leaving the combat to their remaining minions. 
Otherwise, the derro alternate between thunder-
wave and poisoned bolts. Surviving destrachan 
continue with their destructive harmonics. The 
digester continues its attack.
Following Rounds: If the yrthak escaped, it wreaks 
havoc in the Great Hall, using its sonic attacks to 
destroy structures and villains alike. In response 
to those attacks, the ballistae at Room D43 and 
Room D45 launch attacks at the winged reptile. 
Formian workers scramble to repair damaged 
structures and 2d12 formian warriors and a 
formian myrmarch move to Room D37 to elim-
inate the PCs on round 6. The rest of the Great 
Hall is alert until the formians destroy the yrthak 
and the PCs.
If the PCs or tremors destroy the gravel and render-
ing house, the formians force the slaves to carry the 
larger rocks directly to the lava. For lubrication, they 
simply slaughter slaves at the drill site and dump the 
bodies near the bore. This is not effective, but the 
derro do not care. It takes the formian workers 2d3 
days to rebuild this structure.
Treasure: One of the derro handlers has an iron key. 
The key unlocks the gate to Room D47.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a formian taskmaster to this Room and have 
it control the digester. To decrease the challenge, 
remove the yrthak.

309
D38 . CISTERN
A 40 ft. tank, nearly 30 ft. in diameter, stands in 
the center of the chamber. Guarding it are five 
insect men and a crippled derro, who fills cups with 
water drawn from the massive container. The floor 
around the cistern is muddy.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This reservoir holds fresh water. Six form-
ian warriors stand guard, while a crippled derro ra-
tions out the water to dusty workers. The formians 
pay little attention to the humanoid, being watchful 
of trespassers or idle workers. Four formians stand 
evenly spaced, guarding each cardinal point. The 
other two flank the derro.
Mylthran, the crippled derro, on the other 
hand, despises his lot, the formians and the xill 
controlling the entire region. In fact, his hatred is 
so fierce he despises even his own people, seeing 
them only as traitors. Several weeks ago, he broke 
his leg in a cave-in. He refused treatment in the 
infirmary and managed to set the bone himself. 
Somehow, he was not condemned to the rendering 
house, and instead forced to work the cistern.
Since taking his new post, he has secretly poi-
soned the well, adding more and more toxins with 
the intention of murdering the region’s population. 
What has happened instead is most of the inhabi-
tants have resisted the poison and grown immune 
to it. Those that have not are easier to paralyze and 
thereby easier to inject with eggs. Now the well is 
extremely toxic and anyone who has not been accli-
mated to it must succeed a DC 15 Constitution save 
or take 5d6 poison damage and have their maxi-
mum hit points reduced by the same amount until 
the end of their next long rest. Ten rounds later, 
regardless of whether they made the initial save or 
not, the victim must succeed another save against 
the same DC, or the poison deals an addition 5d6 
poison damage, reducing the maximum hit points 
in the same way.
Encounter Condition: Poor Footing 4
Tactics: The formian warriors do not wait for discus-
sion before attacking. A myrmarch ordered them to 
protect the cistern at all costs, as it is the only fresh 
water supply in the region. Hence, if the PCs ap-
proach and the formian warriors notice them, they 
attack first, alert the rest of the hall to the threat if it 
is not already aware, and call for reinforcements.
Mylthran runs as fast as he can to Room D32, 
where he believes he can make a quick escape.
If the PCs or tremors destroy the cistern, the en-
tire operation is in jeopardy with no water, and the 
inhabitants dehydrate. There is a supply of water 
in Rooms D72 and D75 but Chtrax does not divert 
labor to acquire it. Instead, he doubles and triples 
the shifts, intent on finding the vault before his 
labor force perishes. Should this take place, escalate 
the tarrasque’s timeline as detailed in the Introduc-
tion by two days, meaning the devils escape on Day 
5 instead of Day 7.
PCs without water can survive for 1 day plus the 
number of hours equal to their Constitution scores. 
On the third day after the cistern’s destruction, all 
slaves take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. On the 
fourth day, they take another 3 (1d6) points of non-
lethal damage. This continues until the tarrasque 
breaks through to the devil vault.
Treasure: Mylthran carries 6 doses of dark reaver 
powder (300 gp each).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a normal stone golem. To decrease the chal-
lenge, reduce the number of formian warriors by 2.
D39 . BORE
A giant drill descends into the earth. Sprouting 
from it are four large iron bars, pushed by four 
stone giants. The drill threads carry chunks of 
rock upward to the platform overhead. The rock 
surrounding the drill head is slippery with lubricant 
and smokes with a foul odor. Overseeing the bore’s 
progress is an enormous insect creature and four 
small insect warriors.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Four stone giants push the handles of 
an enormous bore. As they rotate it, chunks of 
truesilver emerge near the cavity. Shifts change in 
8 hours, effectively doubling the stone giants here 
for 1 minute.
Watching their progress is the formian myr-
march in charge of truesilver extraction and refine-
ment. He keeps eight formian warriors nearby to 

310
ensure security. Aside from overseeing the drilling 
process, he is aware of disruptions in the Great Hall 
and commands his formian warriors through the 
hive mind to deal with disruptions. In addition, he 
is also responsible for repairing structures and so 
oversees the formian workers in Room D46.
The formian warriors are watchful for slackers 
and intruders and actively make Wisdom (Percep-
tion) checks. Each round the PCs remain within line 
of sight with the bore, allow the formian warriors 
there to make Wisdom (Perception) checks. If they 
see the PCs, they immediately report the informa-
tion to the myrmarch, who in turn alerts the rest of 
the hall to the presence of intruders.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The myrmarch has his orders – destroy all 
intruders. Leading his warriors, he sends out a 
mental alert to all the formians in the complex and 
attacks the PCs. Each round 1d3 additional formian 
warriors arrive to help their master, until 18 form-
ians arrive. The giants continue to turn the bore 
but will defend themselves if attacked. The derro 
ballistae crews at Rooms D43 and D45 target PCs 
they can see.
Killing the myrmarch removes the formians’ hive 
mind ability and imposes disadvantage to all of 
their attacks, saves and skill checks.
If the PCs, tremors, or the destruction of the 
platform above collapses and destroys the bore, 
truesilver extraction stops, lacking the materials 
to construct another one. Fortunately, Chtrax has 
enough truesilver for the gnome to make the collar 
for the Pit Fiend. With the extraction processes halt-
ed, Chtrax leaves this section to oversee the digging 
at Room D61 or with the gnome in Room D63, 
with a 50% chance of each. The formians divert 
the slaves and derro to various tunnels throughout 
the complex to aid in the digging efforts. There-
after, only a token force remains in this chamber; 
halve the number of all creatures encountered in 
this section.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add 30 hit points to the myrmarch. To decrease the 
challenge, increase the time it takes reinforcements 
to arrive to 1d6 rounds and remove one of the 
stone giants.
D40 . PLATFORM
Framing the great drill are four huge metal poles, 
easily 5 ft. thick. Atop of the poles, 80 ft. high, 
stands a platform. From one side descends a ramp. 
Two ladders, on the opposite sides offer access 
to the top.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: Working atop the platform are six form-
ian workers who use force clamps to move the rock 
from the helical thread to the iron carts. Two stone 
giants push the carts onto the tracked ramp, Room 
D35, to travel down to Room D33. These creatures 
are oblivious to combat and do nothing to aid those 
below, focused obsessively on their work.
Encounter Condition: Tremors 18
Tactics: These creatures do not initiate combat, nor 
do they converse with PCs. If attacked, however, the 
stone giants fight back. The formian workers flee, 
scuttling down the ladders as quickly as they can. 
The stone giants hurl chunks of rock as they come 
up the thread until the PCs close to melee combat. 
Then, the giants make bull rush attacks to knock 
them from the platform. The ballistae at Room D43 
and Room D45 have a clear line of sight to the plat-
form and direct their attacks there if combat breaks 
out, unconcerned if they happen to hit a stone giant 
or formian. If the PCs reduce the giants to 10 hit 
points or less, they surrender.
A fall from the platform deals 24 (8d6) points 
of damage.
If the platform is destroyed, the bore falls to 
the floor in a random direction. With the platform, 
the ramp at Room D35 falls as well. To see the 
falling drills’ direction, roll 1d20 and consult the 
table below.

Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
make the platform unstable, requiring the PCs to 
succeed at a DC 15 Dexterity check to keep their 
footing. If they fail by 5 or more, they fall to the 
ground 80 ft below. In addition, add two more 
formian workers, so they can heal one of the stone 
giants. To decrease the challenge, remove one of 
the stone giants.
D41 . TRANSPORTATION AND INVENTORY
A cart track runs into this building from one side 
and out another. A stone giant wheels the cart into 
the building and then walks up the track. Outside 
of the building stand three insect warriors.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Three elite formian warriors guard this 
room. Their orders are to ensure no one tampers 
with arriving or departing ore carts. These crea-
tures are watchful, so allow them to make Wis-
dom (Perception) checks against any creatures in 
line of sight.
Inside a formian taskmaster and its destrachan 
servant inventory the truesilver bars going to the 
gnome. He submits a weekly report to the formian 
myrmarch, who in turn reports to Chtrax to show 
their progress.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The formian warriors generally ignore anyone 
moving past this room, only attacking anyone not 
of the Great Hall and approaching this room. When 
attacking, they do not move more than 10 ft. away 
from the room, falling back should PCs attempt to 
lure them away. Combat with these formians alerts 
the rest of the Great Hall to the intruders. On the 
following round, the formian taskmaster exits the 
room, commanding the destrachan to attack, while 
it enters melee. At the beginning of each round of 
combat, 1d4 formian warriors arrive until 12 show 
up. Then, the formian myrmarch from Room D39 
comes to dispatch any surviving PCs.
If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, busi-
ness continues as normal; a formian taskmaster 
goes to Room D34 to count.
Treasure: At any given time, there are 2d20 1-lb. bars 
of truesilver. Each bar is worth 750 gp. Recall, if any 
creature touches the bar, the bar becomes standard 
silver, worth about 5 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
double the number of elite formian warriors. To 
decrease the challenge, remove the resistances and 
immunities from the destrachan.

D42 . BARRACKS
Ramshackle cots fill this large building. Cobwebs 
cling to corners and the floor is filthy with dust, 
hair and dirt. Otherwise, the room is empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This large building is not much more 
than a warehouse filled with beds, its rear wall ex-
posed rock. Once, the derro slept here, but now it is 
always empty as the derro sleep in or around their 
work areas.
Encounter Condition: [Safe]
Tactics: This is a good place for the PCs to rest as no 
one ever comes here anymore. Only roll for Ran-
dom Encounters once per day at this location.
If the PCs or tremors destroy this 
room, no one notices.
Treasure: PCs searching under 
the cots and succeeding a 
DC 20 Intelligence (Investi-
gation) check find a secret 
compartment concealed 
by years of grime. The 
compartment is locked, its 
key long lost, requiring a 
successful DC 25 Dexterity 
check to open. Alternatively, 
a PC succeeding a DC 20 
Strength check can break it 
open. Inside are the following 
items: six cut sapphires (1,000 
gp each), a small charcoal diagram 
of a repeating ballista (100 gp), an 
obsidian bracelet with three small 
spheres each etched with a decora-
tive rune (140 gp), a perfect cylinder 
made of cherry wood (800 gp), a 
smooth slate ring (500 gp), a doll 
made of human skin (no value), +2 
dagger, ring of water walking, and a 
pearl of power. Souiji’s daughter, a 
consummate thief, left this hidden 
cache. She intended to return for 
her things, but a xill egg killed her 
before she could.
Scaling: N/A
D43 . GUARD BALCONY
A dark staircase carved into the rock 
winds upward, presumably to the balcony 80 ft. 
above the Great Hall. From below, you can see a 
mounted large ballista and derro leaning over the 
rail to watch those below.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Three derro sentries guard the Great 
Hall. One mans the repeating ballista (see below) 
mounted on a swivel base. The other two carry 
heavy repeating crossbows. As they keep an eye out 
for trouble, they use the repeating ballista against 
any foes combating the inhabitants of the Great 
Hall. With their height advantage along with the 
dim lighting in the Hall, the derro have a good view 
of the entire complex.

313
Repeating Ballista: 3d8/19-20; range 120 ft.; crew 1; 
cost 1,000 gp
Unlike normal ballistae, the repeating ballista 
may fire up to six projectiles before needing a new 
cartridge. The crew makes a ranged attack with 
this weapon, but at disadvantage for size. It takes 
3 rounds to reload this weapon, 2 rounds if two 
people work together.
There are five cartridges total for the ballista.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the derro sentries spot combat in the Great 
Hall, they use the repeating ballista and heavy 
crossbow attacks against the PCs. If the PCs come 
up the access tunnel, the three derro ready actions 
to fire their heavy repeating crossbows against any 
intruders coming up the stairs behind them. These 
derro are infected and fight to the death.
If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, the bal-
cony and its survivors fall to the ground, destroy-
ing both the ballista and the sentries. The formian 
workers repair the balcony in 1d2 days.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a second ballista and have each deal an addi-
tion 2d6 fire damage to each hit. To decrease the 
challenge, double the reload time.
D44 . EAST SENTRY
Three steps lead up to this exit. At the top, a single 
sentry defends it. It resembles a giant derro, except 
it is made of granite. Blood stains and shattered 
bones cover the floor below.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The stone golem guards this exit and is 
under orders to attack any creature not accompa-
nied by a formian or derro. Hence, the golem has 
killed many slaves trying to get back to work in the 
mines. The golem attacks the PCs as soon as they 
either attack it or come within 20 ft.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The golem closes with the PCs and uses its 
slow attack. On the following rounds, it uses full 
attack actions as much as possible. This golem 
fights until destroyed. Combat with this sentry 
is common, so 1d6 formian warriors only come 
to investigate 50% of the time. If the warriors do 
come to the fight, they alert the rest of the Great 
Hall, and 1d4 more formian warriors arrive every 
1d6 rounds until a total of 12 formian warriors are 
on site. Thereafter, no one else in the hall comes to 
investigate.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give this stone golem an additional 40 hit points. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the chance of 
reinforcements to 25%.
D45 . GUARD PLATFORM
A dark staircase carved into the rock winds upward, 
presumably to the balcony 80 ft. above the Great 
Hall. From below, you see a ballista extending over 
the railing. At ground level, there is a dark tunnel 
leading to some steps.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The derro sentries that once manned 
this ballista have succumbed to the xill eggs. Now, 
three xill occupy this room, feasting on the remains 
of their former hosts. They are uninterested in the 
developments in the great hall, but if the PCs, or 
any other creature approach within 20 ft. of this 
room, allow the xill Wisdom (Perception) checks 
to notice. If they catch sight of the intruders, one 
creeps forward to the repeating ballista and takes 
aim, while the other two outsiders move silently 
down the stairs.
Repeating Ballista: 3d8/19-20; range 120 ft.; crew 1; 
cost 1,000 gp.
Unlike normal ballistae, the repeating ballista 
may fire up to six projectiles before needing a new 
cartridge. The crew makes a ranged attack with 
this weapon, but at disadvantage for size. It takes 
3 rounds to reload this weapon, 2 if two people 
work together.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Once in position, the xill on the balcony fires, 
hoping to herd the PCs into the darkened tunnel 
where the xill’s comrades wait. PCs scaling the wall 
or flying reach the balcony 80 ft. up, while the xill 
targets PCs still on the ground. Once any PCs reach 
the balcony, the xill retreats to the tunnel entrance, 
where he fights to the death or until his allies come 

314
up from below. Meanwhile, the xill in the tunnel 
“ready an action” to attack the first PC entering 
the tunnel. One focuses on grappling and injects 
an egg into the subject, while the other joins the 
grapple. If more PCs approach, one xill struggles 
to inject an egg in the first victim, while the second 
withdraws from the grapple to defend its ally. These 
creatures fight to the death.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
remove the disadvantage from the ballista and give 
each xill the Sneak Attack feature (2d6). To decrease 
the challenge, remove one xill.
D46 . FORMIAN BARRACKS
This long, low-slung structure is made of stone 
worked in honeycomb patterns. The structure is 
immaculate, the ground around the place smooth 
and level, adorned with line patterns on the floor 
extending outward away from the building some 
10 ft. Round portals offer access to the building’s 
dark interior.
Initial Attitude: N/A or Indifferent
Encounter: This unusual building, designed by its 
occupants, serves as the formian barracks. Though 
outsiders do not need to sleep, formians function 
better with a place to collect their thoughts between 
shifts. The barracks are in effect eight different 
cells. Each cell is bare, except for a conical mound 
in the center where a small orb of granite rests. 
The formians focus their thoughts on the perfect 
sphere as a means to maintain perfectly ordered 
thoughts. Complex line patterns cover the walls and 
floors, leading through the patterns to the mount-
ed spheres.
Presently, the barracks are empty, giving the PCs 
a chance to rest, stage an ambush, or investigate 
their enemy. After 30 minutes roll for a Random 
Encounter.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, the 
Great Hall continues as normal, except there is a 
15% chance any given room has its numbers halved. 
In addition, the loss to the formian workers increas-
es the number of days needed to repair a damaged 
or destroyed building by 1d3.
Treasure: Each room houses a perfect sphere of 
granite. The craftsmanship, not the material, makes 
these 10-lb. spheres valuable. There are eight 
spheres, each worth 20 gp.
Scaling: N/A
D47 . CORRAL OF THE BEAST HANDLERS
The gate to the corral is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity check to unlock it; the beast handler at 
Room D37 has the key. Inside the gate, the mon-
sters all wander about the open area. A large trough 
of semi-clean water sits at one end. The monsters 
here are beyond caring and have little fight left in 
them. They are fatigued, and only fight if attacked. 
[A fatigued PC can neither run nor charge and takes 
a -2 penalty on Strength and Dexterity checks.] They 
fight to the death, battling mostly in defense and not 
working together.
A 9-ft.-tall wall of stone corrals this place. 
From inside, you hear growling and roaring, the 
crunching of bones and other disturbing sounds 
associated with feasting. Guarding the gate on 
the side facing the great drill are three formian 
warriors holding halberds. Behind them, you 
clearly see a collection of fearsome monsters, 
including a bulette, a couple of digesters and even a 
destrachan.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Three elite formian warriors guard the 
corral to ensure no one tampers with the beasts. 
Inside, there is one bulette, one destrachan, and 
two digesters. The formians are watchful. If the PCs 
approach, and the formians are not on alert, one 
of the formian warriors demands to know the PCs’ 
business. The PCs must succeed a DC 25 Charisma 
(Deception) check to prevent the formians from 
attacking. If the encounter turns to combat, the 
formian warriors alert the rest of the Great Hall 
with their Hive Mind ability before attacking. The 
monsters are all fatigued from their work in the 
Great Hall and are not interested in fighting unless 
provoked. If the PCs keep out of the corral, the 
monsters ignore them.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: After combat starts, 1d2 more formian 
warriors arrive every 1d4 rounds until a total of 
two more have arrived. On the round after the last 

315
formian warrior arrives to reinforce the guards, the 
formian myrmarch from Room D39 arrives.
The formian warriors let the PCs come to them 
rather than charging into the thick of the battle. Re-
inforcements surprise attack the PCs from the rear. 
Even if the desperation of the fight escalates, the 
formian warriors do not draw the monsters inside 
the corral into the fight.
If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, all 
surviving monsters escape and head in random 
directions to kill as many formians and derro 
as possible.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
remove the fatigued condition from the monsters 
inside the corral and have them attack. To decrease 
the challenge, replace the elite formian warriors 
with standard formian warriors.
D48 . HEADQUARTERS
As the PCs approach this room read the fol-
lowing text:
Clearly, this structure is new and imposing when 
compared to the other buildings in this massive 
gallery. Blending alien architecture with the grim 
utilitarian features characteristic of this region, it 
sports fluted columns, odd and apparently useless 
spinning gears, all incorporated in an intricate 
stone pattern. The building is windowless and has 
a single entrance: a purple-steel-crystal-trapezoid-
shaped door.
If the PCs enter, read the following text:
Beyond the glowing door is a foyer of sorts, 
extending 10 ft. to either side and ahead about 
12 ft. The room is barren both of furnishings and 
decor, except for a puce-colored disk inset at the 
center of the room. A single door of the same 
material and shape as the one you just entered 
stands closed in the center of each wall.
Consult the Great Hall introduction for details on 
Chtrax’s placement in this section.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is the entrance to Chtrax’s 
most private sanctum and headquarters. When a 
petitioner wishes to speak with the xill master, they 
know to stand on the circle, call to their master 
and state the purpose of their visit. If Chtrax is 
not present or does not wish to address the peti-
tioner, he ignores them. The derro and formians 
know to leave if they do not hear a response with-
in a minute.
To prevent unwanted intrusions and to com-
mand fear and respect from his minions, Chtrax 
warded all of the doors leading to the inner sanc-
tum with terrible traps. If Chtrax agrees to speak 
with the petitioner, he deactivates the traps from 
inside Room D49 and opens the central door. Oth-
erwise, PCs or foolish servants attempting to reach 
the inner sanctum must contend with the nasty 
devices protecting the xill. 
All three interior doors and the speaking circle 
detect as magical. 
 '
Door Trap of Fireball. Detect: DC 25 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 25 Dexterity; Triggering 
the trap releases a fireball spell upon the char-
acters, who will need to make a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw.
 '
Door Trap of Polymorph. Detect: DC 25 Wisdom 
(Perception); Disable: DC 25 Dexterity; Triggering 
the trap releases a polymorph spell upon the charac-
ters, who will need to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving 
throw to resist or be turned into a peacock.
 '
Door Trap of Cloudkill. Detect: DC 25 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 25 Dexterity; Triggering the 
trap releases a cloudkill spell upon the characters, 
who will need to make a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw to resist.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A; However, if Chtrax is present in Room 
D49, he readies for combat if one of the traps trig-
ger or a PC stands on the speaking circle and says 
nothing. If afforded the time, he grabs the phylac-
tery and hides. See Room D49 for more details.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace all three traps with wail of the banshee traps 
(DC 15 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit 
points; on a success, suffer 10d6 psychic damage). 
To decrease the challenge, change all the door traps 

316
to the following: cloudkill trap (right), chain lightning 
trap (center), and black tentacles trap (left).
D49 . INNER SANCTUM
The stink of this enormous hall is overpowering. 
Overhead hang globes of purplish light casting 
obscure shadows on the walls. Filling the room 
are innumerable tables holding twitching, barely 
conscious derro, duergar and deep dwarves. Given 
their supine positions and distended abdomens, it 
is clear something is gestating inside them. Sprays 
of reddish-brown liquid stain the walls and ceiling, 
while the floor is black and sticky.
If the PCs enter through the center door, or round 
one of the corners, read the following text if Chtrax is 
not present:
In the center of the chamber, upon a dais, stands 
a silver tripod holding a 1-cubic-ft. box of some 
silvery metal, encrusted with gems, etched 
with runes, and flickering with unfathomable 
intelligence.
If Chtrax is present, read the following text instead.
In the center of the chamber and upon a dais 
stands an empty silver tripod.
Initial Attitude: N/A or Hostile
Encounter: This room is a testimony to the depths of 
Chtrax’s fathomless evil. To replace the substandard 
derro, Chtrax breeds his own here. Summoning an 
occasional derro or dwarf to receive a reward for 
their labors and wisdom, Chtrax injects an egg in-
side the host. Some he releases back into the mines 
– others, especially the dangerous ones, he keeps 
locked up here.
Amid the developing wombs, Chtrax plots his 
course, tracking the progress of his tunneling, the 
truesilver extraction and the birth rate of his spawn. 
He also keeps the formian queen’s phylactery here, 
in proximity so he can maintain the hive mind.
If Chtrax is present and aware of the PCs ap-
proach, the protection of the phylactery is of 
paramount importance. He snatches the phylactery 
from its stand and casts as many spells as he can 
before the PCs enter.
Chtrax uses cloudkill to control the terrain of the 
encounter. If he has the chance, he uses animate 
dead to provide a distraction, as combining zombie 
troops with cloudkill is a lethal combination, since 
zombies are immune to the poison. Chtrax saves 
his polymorph for opposing spellcasters, preferring 
to change them into peacocks. If an encounter 
turns against him, Chtrax does not hesitate to 
flee. He never forfeits his life for mere formians. If 
prevented from fleeing, he uses his offensive spells, 
using his staff of fire if necessary.
If Chtrax dies, the phylactery vanishes, freeing 
the formians from the xill’s hold and having results 
as described in this region’s Introduction. However, 
the digging continues. The tarrasque, driven by the 
commands of the derro savant controlling it, con-
tinues to press forward unless somehow stopped. 
On the other hand, the tunnels descend into 
bloody death traps, with formians killing derros and 
dwarves, stone giants attacking the derro, and the 
bulette and other monsters rampaging. All truesil-
ver extraction halts, and the gnome in Room D53 
ceases production of the mining equipment and 
emerges to seize control over Rooms D57 to D61. If 
the PCs do not stop the tarrasque, the devils break 
free on schedule and sweep through the tunnels 
bent on genocide.
If the PCs or tremors destroy this room and 
Room D48, check to see if Chtrax was present. If he 
was, he escapes with the phylactery to Room D61, 
where he remains until Day 7. If he was not present, 
the destruction of the building destroys the phylac-
tery and the formians act as described above.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If present, and allowed time to prepare, 
he casts the following spells in order: expeditious 
retreat, stoneskin, and greater invisibility. When the 
PCs enter the room, he then casts cone of cold, 
targeting as many PCs as he can. On the following 
round, he flees, alerting the entire Great Hall. If 
combat becomes unavoidable, Chtrax strikes from 
surprise, using greater invisibility, spider climb and 
haste to first observe his foe and then strike from 
unexpected angles.
All surviving unattached elite formian warriors 
arrive on round 3 and 1d6 formian warriors arrive 
every 2 rounds after, until all surviving members of 
the 30 unattached formians arrive. Finally, in five 
rounds, the formian myrmarch arrives to aid his 

317
leader. Chtrax takes any opportunity he can to es-
cape, fleeing to Room D61, where he remains until 
the tarrasque breaches the vault.
Treasure: Hidden beneath one of the tables is 
Chtrax’s journal and notes, written in Infernal. Play-
ers able to translate the book learn all the details 
in this region’s Introduction, including details on 
Asrakhor the Undying, the devil vault and Chtrax’s 
nefarious plan.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase Chtrax’s hit points by 30. To decrease the 
challenge, remove Chtrax from this room.
D50 . RUINED BUILDING
The shattered ceiling collapsed here, with nothing 
remaining of this building aside from a few broken 
walls, bones and rubble.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This building was a storage facility, but 
tremors collapsed part of the ceiling causing it to 
fall and destroy the contents. This building serves to 
clue your players about the Great Hall’s instability. If 
the PCs make a frontal assault, allow them to make 
a Wisdom (Perception) check to catch sight of this 
ruined building before they recklessly engage the 
formians. Of course, if they do not see the clue for 
what it is, let them die.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D51 . SILVER TRACK
A line of track runs on the floor from a circular 
building to a large exit. 
Initial Attitude: N/A or Indifferent
Encounter: Two stone giants push an ore cart laden 
with truesilver from Room D41 to Room D53. It 
takes one minute to move the ore cart from Trans-
portation and Inventory (D52) to reach the Gnome’s 
Workshop. There, it takes three minutes to unload 
them, and then eight minutes to return. The giants 
then work at the bore or return to their lair in Room 
D27. Typically, the giants make 1d3 trips per day, 
and there is always at least 1d6 hours between each 
trip. Therefore, there is a 30% chance the giants are 
at a random point, somewhere on the track.
The giants hate their work and are thus both 
slow and slothful. Should they encounter the PCs, 
they are indifferent and depending on the PCs’ 
attitudes, may or may not let them go about their 
business. Confronted with well-armed and danger-
ous opponents, the stone giants ignore them and 
go about their business. On the other hand, if the 
PCs are weak, the giants attack them.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Should combat occur, the giants attack to kill 
the PCs quickly and efficiently by pummeling them 
with slam attacks. If combat turns against them, 
they call out for help. If they start calling, roll for 
Random Encounters to see what happens or who 
comes to investigate. The giants will flee if one falls 
below 50 hit points.
Treasure: If the giants head toward the Gnome’s 
Workshop (Room D53), then their cart holds 1d6 x 
10 1-lb. bars of truesilver. Each bar is worth 750 gp, 
but if touched by a mortal, the metal transmutes to 
normal silver, reducing the bars’ value to 5 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each giant a single-use Action Surge. To de-
crease the challenge, remove one giant.
D52 . TUNNEL AND INTERSECTION
Following the rail, you travel down the wide tunnel. 
Words of encouragement, praises to the Master, 
and solemn reminders of duty echo in your ears. 
The exhortations continue from invisible mouths 
until you reach an intersection, where an enormous 
statue of a multi-armed demon stands proudly, 
with one hand on the head of an adoring derro 
servant, another hand on the shoulder of a proud 
formian warrior, with dwarves and derro groveling 
at his feet. The dark corridor grows brighter 
with flickering light to the right and sounds of 
deep rumbling and tools working away stone 
from the left
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A permanent wall of force protects this 
statue. Chtrax believes it to be a symbol of inspira-
tion for the derro and the slaves, and it pleases him 

318
to walk by it. There is a 5% chance Chtrax (Room 
D49) is here admiring his features.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A

D53 . LABORATORY
The tunnel opens into a large cave with 
multicolored walls, pieces of flowstone near 
the high, 30-ft.-tall ceiling with attached stone 
draperies. Crystal coral and gypsum flowers cover 
the floor, reflecting the light and presenting a 
dazzling scenario. Marring this natural artistic 
display are four cages hanging from the ceiling, 
each housing a half-starved and much-abused 
dwarf slave. At the far end of the cave is a small 
forge, shimmering in the light in the room. Several 
worktables hold mechanical atrocities, devices of 
unspeakable purpose. Against the walls, between 
the occasional stalactite and column, stands a 
half-carved granite humanoid, twitching as if 
alive. Emerging from the shadows is a petite 
humanoid with pale, curly brown hair, and a wry 
smile distorting his face. In one hand, he carries an 
overlarge fork, but instead of metal tines there are 
crackling electricital sparks.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Chtrax’s pet artificer, Korus the gnome, 
works in this laboratory designing tools and devic-
es to aid in the mining, the extraction of truesilver 
and whatever evil designs hatched by the xill tyrant. 
Though the gnome nominally works for the xill, he 
is not exceptionally loyal, and instead enjoys work-
ing and hurting others in the process. He keeps 
four derro and deep dwarf slaves in cages suspend-
ed from the ceiling as test subjects for his horrid 
experiments. They are on the verge of death.
Korus’ greatest task, one requiring vast amounts 
of truesilver, is a collar and manacles set he is 
building. Knowing the importance of these items 
to the xill, he hides them behind one of the stone 
draperies and conceals his progress in their manu-
facture. He feels once the collar and manacles are 
complete, Chtrax’s use for him may end, and Korus 
does not know if the xill will allow him the same 
amounts of freedom he has enjoyed thus far.
Korus does not attack immediately, though he is 
suspicious. He waits to see what the PC do or say, 
to assess their usefulness as allies or the threat they 
pose as enemies. If the PCs are amenable to con-
versation, despite the room’s sinister atmosphere 
and the nasty tool in the gnome’s hand, Korus ea-
gerly engages them in conversation. On the other 
hand, if combat erupts, the gnome throws a hidden 
lever on the eastern wall of the tunnel, releasing 
his pet digesters before hammering the PCs with a 
barrage of spells.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: With a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persua-
sion) check, Korus tells the PCs the following:
Chtrax, a powerful xill, controls these mines. He 
has easily assumed control of the region, especially 
after the flooding and subsequent chaos. Having 
murdered most of the derro savants, and with the 
might of his formian slaves, he enjoys complete 
control over the derro and their minions. The xill 
searches for something in the depths of the world, 
something called the vault, though what exactly is 
inside, only Chtrax knows. Of his minions, only the 
derro are truly loyal. The stone giants work for the 
master only because it serves their purpose. Even 
the formians serve through coercion.
With a successful DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check, 
Korus adds the following:
Chtrax’s control over the formians exists only 
because he has stolen the formian queen’s essence 
and trapped it inside a special phylactery. If you 
want to disrupt Chtrax’s plans, destroy the box 
and watch them explode. One more thing, beware 
the tunnels in the deeper mines. Chtrax controls a 
tarrasque and uses it to dig the deepest tunnels.
If diplomacy fails, Korus first uses mage hand 
to throw the lever releasing his digesters in Room 
D54, and then casts greater invisibility, moving 
toward the exit. On the next round, he casts expedi-
tious retreat and flees. If there are any survivors, he 
casts wall of force, blocking the PCs inside the room 
before fleeing to warn Chtrax. Korus, despite his 
power, would rather flee than face a band of well-
armed adventurers.

A SAMPLE OF KORUS' TOOLS AND OTHER DEVICES
Force Clamp: This tool looks for all intents and 
purposes like a small fork, but instead of metal 
tines, it projects contained force. These tools allow 
the slaves and derro to handle truesilver without 
touching it, or without channeling the mortal taint 
through metal. A force clamp is a viable weapon; 
it uses the same statistics as a club. Force clamps 
have all the characteristics and immunities as a wall 
of force, making them virtually indestructible to 
physical damage.
Forgefire: This alchemical fuel burns hotter and 
longer than normal fire. The slaves use it to smelt 
truesilver faster and more efficiently. Unlike alche-
mist fire, forgefire is a solid and does not ignite 
unless exposed to fire. Once lit, a half-pound brick 
of forgefire burns for 1d6 days. You can throw 
forgefire, with adequate protection, but as a stan-
dard ranged attack and not as a ranged touch 
attack. If it hits, the target takes 2d6 points of fire 
damage and must succeed a DC 20 Dexterity save 
to avoid catching on fire. If lit, the victim takes 3 
(1d6) points of fire damage each additional round 
but may extinguish the flames by succeeding a DC 
15 Dexterity save
Pocket Air: Created to produce a pocket of air in 
the case of a cave-in, this wondrous item looks 
like small blue marble. When cast to the ground, 
though, it shatters and releases a gust of wind 
originating from the point of impact caused by the 
introduction of 300 cubic ft. of new fresh air. One 
can throw pocket air with 10-ft. range increments, 
up to 50 ft. In sealed spaces, the new air fills the 
available space and stops.
Softlight: When spread out onto a flat surface, this 
purple dust ignites. It burns but generates no heat. 
Furthermore, its luminescence does not affect crea-
tures with light sensitivity but is still enough light to 
cast light equivalent to bright light in a 5 ft. radius 
and dim lighting 10 ft. beyond. Softlight burns for 
8 hours. Once lit, you cannot move it, nor does it 
ignite other combustibles. 
Sounder: This unusual device looks more like a laden 
cart than a digging tool. Measuring 10 ft. long, the 
sounder rolls about on a flatbed atop six wheels. 
The mechanism consists of a 4-ft. wide metal cylin-
drical tank mounted in an iron cradle. Coolant hos-
es pump into the tank to its water reservoir, where 
it cools its magical processes venting the steam 
from the top. The rear of the tank houses the opera-
tion assembly. There, four levers move up and down 
to control the depth, height and width and intensity 
of the probing pulse (the greater the intensity, the 
The digesters, unfailingly loyal to their wicked 
master, open combat with a spray of acid, cross-
ing each other’s cones for maximum effect. If an 
opponent is particularly troublesome, surviving 
digesters use concentrated streams on the most 
threatening foes.
Killing the gnome avails the PCs little, for the 
manacles and collar are complete. If the PCs do 
not find and destroy these items, Chtrax has a 20% 
chance of finding them each day. For the PCs to 
destroy the items, simply touching them is enough, 
or if Chtrax fails to find them, he automatically 
fails to capture Kator on the seventh day when the 
tarrasque breaches the vault.
The captured slaves all carry xill eggs and they 
succumb to the infestation in 1d6 days. Up until 
the xill eggs hatch, they will aid the PCs in whatever 
capacity they can.
Treasure: Aside from the gnome’s personal posses-
sions, he has a wide assortment of his creations. 
Hidden behind a stone drapery (DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check) are the truesilver collar and 
manacles. Mortal hands touching these items 
destroy their magical properties, and these items 
become nothing more than mundane, albeit silver, 
items. Scattered throughout the room are three 
force clamps, six rocks of forgefire, two pocket airs, 
ten doses of softlight, three incomplete sounders 

320
(worth nothing) and one finished sounder. See the 
sidebar for details on these items.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
remove the spell level limit of Korus’ Cast Spell 
legendary action and add three more digesters. To 
decrease the challenge, make the Cast Spell legend-
ary action require two legendary actions, remove his 
Overchannel ability, and remove all digesters.
D54 . PEN
Piles of rotting straw and bits of bone fill this pen.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Four digesters live in this pen. If combat 
erupts in Room D53, Korus releases these monsters 
to aid him against his attackers. Otherwise, the 
digesters feast on the occasional slave Korus offers 
them, content with their fate as beloved pets.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: If the PCs somehow prevent Korus from re-
leasing the digesters, and his life is threatened, the 
digesters use their acid attacks against the gate un-
til they break out on their own. Once they engage 
Korus’ attackers, they fight to the death, using their 
acid spray attacks to hit as many targets as possible.
Treasure: A fist-sized diamond lies under some hay, 
apparently undigestible. It is easily worth 5,000 gp 
more accurate the results, but the greater the risk 
for the machine to malfunction). The tank has small 
bound wire leads running into the directionally re-
versed cone. The cone has handles to allow its ma-
nipulation and placement onto the rock’s surface. 
Three sharp spikes emerge from the front, i.e. its 
narrow end, and they automatically drill into a rocky 
surface. Depressing a button disengages the drills.
When activated, the Sounder sends an elec-
tromagnetic pulse into the rock, which magically 
returns once it reaches the specified depth, height 
and width. When it has pinged out and contracted, 
the pulse carries its information back to the reverse 
cone. Affixed to the fluted edge of the cone are 
seven lenses, tied to each color in the visible light 
spectrum. The color determines the density of the 
rock, where red is the presence of an empty space, 
orange signifies it is filled with heavy gases, yellow 
water, green loose earth, and blue rock. The darker 
colors imply heavier deposits such as lead or gold. 
If the sounder pulse hits adamantine, it emits all 
seven colors. In wide pulses, many densities result. 
In this case, the brightest light is the dominant 
density, while unusual pockets and anomalies may 
register as only a flicker. The best pulses are the 
high intensity, narrow beams. A pulse can extend 50 
ft. into rock, with a 50 ft. width and height.
As mentioned above, a pulse’s intensity dictates 
its accuracy. A low pulse has a 75% chance of a mis-
read, firing a random color, but without a malfunc-
tion. A mid pulse has a 50% chance of a misread, 
but a 10% chance of a malfunction. A mid-high 
pulse has a 25% chance of a misread, but a 30% 
chance of malfunction. Finally, a high pulse has a 
10% chance of a misread, but a 60% malfunction.
If a malfunction results, an arc of electricity leaps 
from the sounder to ground in the nearest living 
target up to 40 ft. away, dealing 8d6 points of light-
ning damage, DC 15 Dexterity save for half damage. 
Chtrax’s obsession in uncovering the vault forces 
the engineers to use high pulses rather than the 
safer mid  or low-pulses. As a result, the sounders 
claim nearly as many lives as the cave-ins.
Truesilver Collar and Manacles: Forged from truesil-
ver and never touched by mortal hands, this match-
ing collar and manacles fit a large devil. When so 
placed, the devil may only utilize his special attacks 
if the owner of the collar and manacles permits it. 
Chtrax commissioned these items to coerce the pit 
fiend Kator to give up his wish.

D57 - D68 . DEEP MINES
This section is the vanguard of the vault miners. The 
center of activity occurs in Room D58, with connect-
ing tunnels branching off in several directions. The 
central chamber is nearly as vast as the Great Hall, 
roughly 100 ft. wide and 70 ft. long. Its ceiling rises to 
60 ft. in the center and 40 ft. at the caverns’ perime-
ter. The large tunnels branching off from the central 
cave, Rooms D59 to D62, feature ceilings 40 ft. tall. 
The smaller tunnels are almost all 5 ft. wide and 10 
ft. tall to accommodate the grimlock foremen. Room 
D58 is lit with softlight, but all other rooms are dark 
unless mentioned otherwise. The tarrasque’s noise 
imposes a -10 penalty to all Wisdom (Perception) 
checks to listen, and the dust filling the air imposes 
a -5 penalty to Wisdom (Perception) checks to spot 
things. Just like the Great Hall, this is a dangerous 
location, and subterfuge and infiltration are the pre-
ferred tactics over a frontal assault.
The greatest threat in this section is the tarrasque 
in Room D61. Tenuously controlled by a mad derro 
savant, this monster rapidly digs through the rock, 
excavating enormous amounts of stone and earth. 
The slaves bring the stone to Room D58, where delv-
ers, destrachan and others work to break it down for 
retaining walls, gravel or simple disposal. The spider 
web of other tunnels house digging teams of grim-
lock-led slaves. These miners suffer. Their lives are 
nothing more than 16-hour days of toil and death. 
Commanding this section is the second formian 
myrmarch, whose responsibility it is to locate the 
mysterious vault.
Combat with formians in this place has similar results 
to combat with them throughout this region. Once 
one group of formians engages the PCs, the en-
tire section goes on alert because of the hive mind 
link between all formians. Each room below details 
normal encounters and encounters when alert. ln 
addition, each room also details what reinforcements, 
if any, arrive to aid their allies. Though many rooms 
list the number of formian warriors who arrive in 
waves, there are only so many formian warriors in 
the area. The Deep Mines have 15 unattached form-
ian warriors, 5 unattached elite formian warriors 
and 1 unattached formian taskmaster. Each time 
the PCs engage in combat in one of the Deep Mine 
rooms, they undoubtedly draw more formians to 
their position as indicated in the room’s description. 
Strike the number of formian warrior reinforcements 
killed from those listed above. When the unattached 
number of formian warriors or formian taskmasters 
falls to zero, no more formian warriors arrive. You 
could move formian warriors from other encounter 
sites to engage the PCs, but those formians are under 
orders to protect their respective rooms. Regardless, 
the Deep Mines resume normal activity after an hour 
lapse between combats.
On Day 3, Chtrax moves to Room D58 when the tar-
rasque reaches the first adamantine bands. Thereafter 
he has a 10% chance to be in a random room in the 
Great Hall, a 50% chance of being in Room D58 and 
a 40% chance to be inspecting the mines in Rooms 
D78 to D80.
Destroying the myrmarch in Room D58 or the 
phylactery in Room D49 alters the dynamics of the 
section. If the PCs destroy the myrmarch, formians in 
this section suffer a -2 penalty to attacks, saves, and 
skill checks and lose their hive mind ability. Destroy-
ing the phylactery, however, removes the hive mind 
ability from all the formians in the entire region, 
telling them their queen is dead. The formians stay 
in their respective locations, attacking any non-form-
ians encountered, including the giants, derro, slaves, 
xill, and PCs. While in this enraged state, PCs cannot 
reason with them. All formians fight to the death.
Allow cautious PCs to move unmolested through this 
section if they do not draw attention to themselves. 
There are plenty of ways for the PCs to move, such 
as by skirting the edge of the cavern and remaining 
out of range of the inhabitants’ darkvision. Should 
the PCs make a direct assault, let them feel the full 
weight of Chtrax’s power.
If the savant retains control over the tarrasque, the 
tarrasque reaches the first adamantine bands on Day 
3, breaches it on Day 4, the second band on Day 5, 
the third band on Day 6 and finally penetrates the 
vault on Day 7.

D57 . ENTRANCE TO THE DEEP MINES
The track ends at the entrance to an enormous 
cavern filled with slaves, formians, and more. ln the 
center of the vast cavern, dozens of dwarven slaves 
are employed, hammering the rock into smaller 
pieces. Formians move through their ranks, their 
razor-sharp claws flashing in the dim light of the 
purple flames dancing on the floor. Branching off 
from this central chamber are numerous tunnels of 
various sizes. What is immediately obvious is the 
noise level, as across the tunnel, great plumes of 
dust and debris pour out of a tunnel. As you watch, 
a roar shakes the entire cavern, and all work stops, 
as formians, derro and dwarves alike, stop to look 
at the ceiling far above.

D58 . DIGGING NEXUS
Note: This is a very difficult encounter, possibly the 
most difficult in the dungeon. It should take several 
hours of game play, and we recommend GMs use 
crib notes before, during, after and throughout all 
stages of combat. Read and re-read this section 
before combat begins.
Loose rocks and gravel cover much of the floor 
area. From the connecting tunnels, emerging dusty 
slaves drag large rocks to a central site in the 
chamber, where the debris is thickest. Deep dwarf 
and duergar slaves hammer at the collected rock 
under a formian myrmarch’s watchful eyes.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This is the heart of the digging operation. 
Working the rock piles are 24 duergar and 12 deep 
dwarves. Overseeing their efforts are 8 formian 
warriors, 2 formian taskmasters, each with a dom-
inated destrachan, and a formian myrmarch. The 
destrachan use sonic attacks to shatter the larger 
rocks, while the slaves shatter the small rocks into 
gravel with mauls and picks or chisel them into 
blocks to use as buttresses for unstable tunnels.
Allow the myrmarch and the formian warriors 
Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the PCs. If 
they beat the PCs’ Dexterity (Stealth) check, the 
formians attack. They consider the PCs a threat to 
the operation, and worse as a catalyst for releasing 
the tarrasque on the rest of the region.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Echoes 8
Tactics: The taskmasters set the destrachan against 
the PCs and use their dominate monster ability 
against the PCs, while the warriors circle the group. 
The myrmarch uses feeblemind, followed by sug-
gestion before closing and engaging in melee. If 
Chtrax is absent and the PCs surrender, the formian 
myrmarch dispatches two warriors to escort the 
PCs to the region’s entrance at Room D6. If Chtrax 
is present, the formians give no quarter, cutting 
the PCs down to the last. The slaves keep working 
throughout combat, defending themselves only 
if attacked.
If combat persists for more than 3 rounds, 1d6 
unattached formian warriors arrive each round until 
all of the unattached formian warriors arrive. If 
combat continues for 6 rounds, the formian sen-
tries at Room D65 come to assist. The inhabitants 

324
of other rooms do not join, holding their positions, 
rather than risk the ire of the xill master.
If the tarrasque breaks free at room D61, the 
formians drive the slaves forward to meet the threat 
in a futile effort to halt the monster’s advance. The 
myrmarch sends one of the formian warriors to 
Chtrax to warn the master of the monsters’ release.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase each formian warrior’s hit points by +20. To 
decrease the challenge, remove one of the taskmas-
ters and rhe destrachan.
D59 . MINE
Working in this wide tunnel is a score of duergar 
slaves, slowly chipping away at the dense 
rock. Barking orders in Undercommon are two 
humanoids. Though blind, they are clearly aware of 
the goings on in this tunnel.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: Slowly digging through the dense tock 
are 18 duergar slaves, suffering under the whips 
and lashings of the grimlock overseers. They live 
to please their master but take no part in combat 
in the neighboring areas. Replacement slaves come 
from the Great Hall and other sections throughout 
the region. 
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Echoes 8
Tactics: No amount of conversation or bargaining 
distracts these workers from their task, cowed as 
they are by Chtrax and the neighboring tarrasque. 
A successful DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check 
panics the teams, who flee to Room D58, seeking 
protection from the myrmarch. If the PCs have 
already destroyed the myrmarch, they flee to the 
Great Hall and out of the region if possible. These 
creatures are no threat to the PCs, unless, of course, 
they succeed in locating the vault.

D60 . BIG MINE
A line of four formian sentries stands guard here, 
as clouds of dust and small rocks spew past them 
from behind. Beyond the line of guards, you see 
a mammoth monster of enormous proportions. 
Armored and bristling with horns, its massive 
claws tear through the rock with ease. Standing 
at its side is a bloodied and dusty derro, whose 
features are blank aside from a beatific smile.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: In a futile effort to curb the tarrasque, 
should he break the derro’s control, these four 
elite formian warriors (hp 102) stand guard. While 
they maintain a constant vigilance in watching the 
tarrasque behind them, they also guard against 
saboteurs who would throw the region into chaos 
by breaking the monster free. Given Souiji’s recent 
efforts, these guards are extra watchful. 
If the PCs approach within 10 ft. of the tunnel’s 
entrance, the elite formian warriors attack. These 
creatures fight to the death.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If attacked, these warriors alert the rest of 
the formians in the deep mines to the presence of 
intruders. Two move forward while the other two re-
main in the tunnel to prevent anyone from getting 
past them. The formian myrmarch at Room D58, if 
he still lives, sends one warrior to alert Chtrax and 
then joins the fight with his remaining warriors the 
following round. On the next round, any remaining 
unattached formians in the Deep Mines arrive. On 
the round after, the formian sentries from Room 
D65, if they still survive, join the fight.
If combat continues through six rounds, the 
mad savant in Room D61 comes to see what is 
wrong. The savant heroically joins the fight, using 
destructive spells. However, each round the savant 
is away from the tarrasque, there is a cumulative 
5% chance for the tarrasque to break the derro’s 
control. Worse, if the savant dies, the tarrasque au-
tomatically breaks free. Should this happen, consult 
this section’s introduction for details.
If the tarrasque at Room D61 breaks free, these 
formians act as the first line of defense, concerting 
their attacks in a futile effort to defeat the monster.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two elite formian warriors to the line of sen-
tries. To decrease the challenge, remove two and 
delay reinforcements by 2 rounds for each wave.
D61 . THE DOOM OF THE DERRO
Amidst clouds of dust and rock ploughs the 
greatest terror in the entire world. Great chunks 
of stone collapse and pull away from the walls as 
the tarrasque digs and digs. Standing behind the 
creature is a robed derro, whose focused expression 
belies his madness. The sound of the monsters 
digging is awesome to be sure. After a moment, the 
derro turns, as if somehow aware, and looks at you, 
a smile blooming on his face.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This encounter is both deadly to the PCs 
and instrumental to defeating Chtrax and his ter-
rible plan. Excavating this tunnel is the tarrasque, 
controlled by its mad master Rroliq. Through a 
well-worded wish, cast years before Chtrax ever 
arrived, Rroliq gained control over this monster, 
but only as long as it remained within 5 ft. If he 
ever leaves the monster, the tarrasque breaks free. 
Each round that Rroliq is more than 5 ft. from the 
tarrasque there is a cumulative 5% chance the 
tarrasque breaks free. If the PCs kill Rroliq, the 
tarrasque automatically breaks free and goes on a 
killing rampage. Chtrax, when he dispatched the 
savants, dared not touch Rroliq, lest the tarrasque 
destroy him. Instead, he allied with the savant, ex-
ploiting him for his powers over this monstrosity.
When the PCs approach this area, Rroliq starts 
casting offensive spells. He does not send the 
tarrasque after them, fully confident in his own 
abilities. PCs naturally want to defend themselves 
and may strike back against the derro. If they kill 
him, they have bigger problems on their hands.
Letting the tarrasque go wild is the surest way to 
defeat Chtrax, short of killing the xill. However, PCs 
ought to get clear as quickly as they can and avoid 
confrontation with this monster. If they are foolish 
enough to fight the tarrasque, let them die.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Rroliq casts spells with little regard for his 
own safety. First, he casts a fireball and takes a step 
towards the PCs. He repeats this tactic again on the 

326
following round, before falling back to lower-level 
offensive spells, saving a finger of death for some-
thing spectacular. Rroliq does not care if he dies, 
knowing the tarrasque will avenge him. If the PCs 
flee, Rroliq does not pursue.
Area of effect spells, like fireball, have additional 
effects in this tunnel, creating an earthquake on the 
ceiling directly above the area of effect.
As long as the savant lives, the tarrasque digs, 
ignoring the events around it. However, the sa-
vant’s death releases the tarrasque, giving it free 
reign to kill and destroy all it can. The tarrasque 
attacks the nearest creatures, snapping up unfor-
tunate victims with its bite attack and swallowing 
them whole.
Thereafter the monster follows, moves, kills, and 
destroys all it can moving along the following path: 
Room D58, Room D57, Room D52, spends several 
rounds leveling the Great Hall (this triggers cave-
ins each round), and then moves toward Room D32 
and beyond, widening the passage as necessary. If 
not stopped, the tarrasque moves out of the region, 
entering the lava flow from Room D2 to enter-
ing another region, laying waste to the dungeon, 
unless the denizens somehow rally and stop the 
monster. It continues its rampage for 1d2 weeks 
before finding a new place to sleep.
The surviving formians, if still under the control 
of their respective myrmarch and the phylactery is 
intact, rally to fight this monster, doing what they 
can to slow its movements. All surviving formian in 
the respective sections move to stop this monster’s 
progress. The derro use destrachan, bulette and 
any other creatures at their disposal to fight as well. 
The slaves, however, use this opportunity to flee, 
moving away from the tarrasque’s path and hiding 
in tunnels or the ruins of Room D7.
Chtrax has no interest in dying at the tarrasque’s 
mercy, and flees to the Western Mines, away from 
the path of destruction. There he bides his time, 
plotting to break into the vault some other way. 
However, it is likely the tarrasque destroys the 
entire operation, setting back Chtrax’s plans for 
years if not decades. If he knows the PCs are re-
sponsible, they have certainly earned his wrath for 
years to come.
On the other hand, if the PCs leave the mon-
ster alone, the tarrasque punches through the final 
barrier on Day 7, releasing the devils imprisoned in 
the vault. Rroliq dies immediately and a spectacular 
fight ensues between the devils and the tarrasque. 
PCs would do best to get away quickly and explore 
some other region in this dungeon. You can play 
through the combat, perhaps even letting the PCs 
control the tarrasque, formians, or even the hordes 
of shrieking fiends finally released after thousands 
of years of imprisonment. This could be a massive 
multi-night conflict, extending beyond the borders 
of this region, or simply a highlight, where you de-
scribe the events in cinematic detail. If you choose 
the latter, allow the devils to defeat the tarrasque 
after 20 rounds of combat before moving on to 
conquer the rest of this region. For more informa-
tion on the devils, their numbers, tactics and goals, 
consult the Vault, Rooms D81 through D84.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the tarrasque enrage as soon as the PCs attack 
the derro. To decrease the challenge, have the tun-
nel cave in once the tarrasque breaks free, requiring 
it to take 6 rounds to pull itself free from the rubble.
D62 . SOUNDERS
At the far end of this massive tunnel hums a six-
wheeled wagon carrying a metal cylindrical tank 
mounted in an iron cradle, with connecting hoses 
running to another reservoir. At the tank’s rear is a 
deep dwarf who manipulates several levers, while 
towards the front another dwarf holds a cone of 
sorts and presses the narrow end to the wall. 
Beyond the odd machine are two narrow tunnels. 
The sound of hammering is undeniable.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: A sounder crew, consisting of two deep 
dwarves, tests the walls with harmonic resonances 
here to see if they are any closer to the Vault. Six 
duergar and a grimlock overseer work in each of 
the narrow tunnels. The sounder crew, if left alone, 
turns on the device, to a narrow beam, high pulse 
with results as described in Room D53, likely arcing 
and killing one of the workers. If the PCs approach, 
the sounder crew alerts the grimlocks in the side 
tunnels, who lead the slaves to attack.
Encounter Condition: N/A

327
Tactics: The PCs can negotiate with the sounder crew, 
but a failed Charisma (Persuasion) check results as 
above. If the PCs improve their attitude, the deep 
dwarves urge them to leave. They know nothing of 
the Chtrax’s plans, although they can explain how 
sounders work.
Combat is straightforward. The grimlocks lead the 
van, charging into the largest body of the PCs. If 
the grimlock overseers fall, the slaves surrender. All 
the duergar slaves carry xill eggs inside them.
If the tarrasque breaks free, the duergar turn on 
their grimlock overseers, possibly hatching the xill 
eggs should the grimlocks hit or kill any of these 
slaves. The deep dwarves flee to the Great Hall.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D63 . SLAVES
Digging through the rock is a team of slaves, led 
by a grimlock, alongside a large, armored horror. 
Sharp rocks, dust and bones litter the area. They 
seem focused on their task.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A crew of duergar slaves, propelled by the 
lash of the grimlock overseer’s whip, slowly digs 
through the dense rock. Working in the narrow tun-
nel is a bulette and its derro handler. The handler 
and half of the slaves carry xill eggs inside them. At 
first sight of the PCs, the grimlock sends one of the 
slaves to fetch the handler and its beast, before it 
commands the slaves to attack.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: As long as the derro handler and the grim-
lock foreman live, the slaves fight the PCs, fearful 
as they are of their masters. The duergar enlarge 
and circle the PCs, moving to gain flanks against 
the spellcasters, while the bulette barrels into the 
warriors. The grimlock aids the bulette’s handler 
with their creature. If both of the leaders fall, the 
duergar flee to Room D58 to gain the myrmarch’s 
protection. If the PCs already dispatched the myr-
march, the slaves flee to the Great Hall and out of 
the region if possible.
If the tarrasque breaks free in Room D61, the 
grimlock and the derro handler lead the bulette and 
the duergar to help stop the monster from destroy-
ing the whole complex.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
make all of the humanoids infected. To decrease the 
challenge, remove the duergar slaves and foreman.
D64 . TARRASQUE NEST
This deep tunnel is a stinking morass of dung, 
rotting carcasses and cast off equipment parts. The 
stench is unbearable. Great rents in the floor of this 
cave speak of some enormous, clawed inhabitant.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This is where the tarrasque retires after a 
long day of work. Filthy and disease-ridden rotting 
body parts, mostly dwarven arms and heads, lie 
scattered throughout. PCs exploring this area are at 
risk of contracting filth fever.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A search through this area turns up some 
incidental items left by the tarrasque’s victims. 
Lodged into the rock is a large jacinth worth 5 ,000 
gp, a star ruby worth 1,400 gp, an emerald worth 
1,000 gp, and four pieces of tourmaline worth 400 
gp each. Scattered throughout the tunnel, created 
by the tarrasque’s friction, as it scratches against 
the tunnel, are 23 various-sized chunks of obsid-
ian, each worth 30 gp each. Beneath one partly 
intact corpse of a derro savant (DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check) is a fully charged wand of 
greater healing (action to use, 5 charges, 1 charge 
has the effect of cure wounds, 2 charges for a mass 
cure wounds).
Scaling: N/A
D65 . SENTRIES
Two insect men stand guard at this intersection, 
ready for anything.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Two formian warriors watch over the 
slaves in the tunnels behind them.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4

328
Tactics: These monsters immediately alert the rest of 
the formians in this section and attack any creature 
they encounter not a derro, dwarf, formian or xill. 
They do not negotiate, and they fight to the death. 
No one in the connecting tunnels comes to help 
these formians. 
If the tarrasque breaks free in Room D61, these 
formian warriors move to Room D58 to help defend 
the rest of the region.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase each warrior’s hit points by +20. To de-
crease the challenge, remove the sentries.
D66 . DIGGERS
The narrow tunnel opens into a small cave, where 
dwarves slowly chip away at the rock. Standing 
over them and gauging their progress is a blind 
humanoid with a drawn whip.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: A crew of slaves and a grimlock mine 
this tunnel. They attack any PCs intruding on their 
tunnel unless the PCs succeed a DC 15 Charisma 
(Deception) or Charisma (Intimidation) check. Oth-
erwise, the duergar attack the PCs, using their tools 
as weapons.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The grimlock knows nothing more detailed 
than the basic organization of the crews and teams 
working in this area. He also knows about the 
tarrasque at Room D61. The duergar, if allowed to 
speak, know a little, having heard rumors from their 
fellow slaves. They think the xill master is close to 
reaching some hidden treasure, and they mutually 
fear the outcome of his finding.
If combat breaks out, the duergar enlarge and 
charge, while the grimlock switches to his battleaxe. 
If combat goes against the slaves and their master, 
the surviving duergar use invisibility to flee.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
worsen the Initial Attitude to Hostile and give each 
grimlock foreman the fighter’s Action Surge ability 
(single use). To decrease the challenge, improve the 
Initial Attitude to Indifferent.
D67 . MINE
More slaves and an overseer work this tunnel. In 
an adjoining cave is a weird mechanical device 
manned by two deep dwarf slaves, connecting the 
machine’s odd cone apparatus to the wall. All focus 
on their labor.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: A team of six duergar slaves and a grim-
lock overseer are mining this tunnel. The device 
in the cave is a sounder (see Room D58), manned 
by two deep dwarf slaves. When the PCs approach, 
the deep dwarves turn on the sounder using a 
mid-pulse. Allow the grimlock to make a Wisdom 
(Perception) check opposed by the PCs Dexterity 
(Stealth) check. If he notices the PCs, he takes no 
obvious action and waits to “see” using his blind 
sight ability to figure out where they go. If the 
PCs leave, he ignores them; if they position them-
selves for an attack, he commands the duergar to 
the ready.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Should combat occur, the grimlock com-
mands his duergar to vanish, and the duergar use 
their innate invisibility ability to disappear, attack-
ing only when a PC happens to walk by them. The 
grimlock retreats to the sounders position and 
commands the deep dwarves to fire a high-level 
pulse as soon as the PCs close. These opponents are 
uninterested in talking and fight to the death.
Treasure: The deep dwarves have an intact and opera-
tional sounder.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each of the duergar slaves the rogue Sneak At-
tack ability (2d6). To decrease the challenge, remove 
the sounder and deep dwarves.
D68 . ABANDONED TUNNELS
This tunnel steeply descends deeper into the earth. 
Algae and luminescent fungus line the walls, fed by 
water droplets beading on the rock’s surface. After 
30 ft., the tunnel ends at a staircase spiraling down 
into a great black void. The scent of moisture is 
undeniable.
Initial Attitude: N/A

329
Encounter: Where this tunnel goes off the map, it 
leads to an underground lake filled with horror. 
The exact details of this site are up to you. The lake 
could be a flooded derro city, inhabited now by a 
powerful aboleth lord and his skum slaves. Alter-
natively, it could lead to more tunnels, with more 
derro miners working to uncover the vault. In any 
case, these details are up to the GM, and for those 
not wishing to expand the dungeon beyond this 
point, simply remove this tunnel from your map.

D69 - D75 . WESTERN MINES
The Western Mines encompass Rooms D69 through 
D75. These tunnels are all new and recently excavated 
in just the last few weeks. Unlike other sections in 
this region, there is no single center of activity; the 
tunnels are still in the exploratory stages, resulting in 
small groups of expert miners as opposed to massive 
networks of miners.
Chtrax commanded his forerunners to explore this 
section, lay track in the tunnels, and excavate the area 
entirely, but a large section collapsed, killing more 
than thirty miners, in room D69. Worse, a few of 
the deeper probes to the north, beyond Rooms D72 
and D75, released a flood of water, killing even more 
slaves and formians. Along with some unusual prop-
erties throughout these tunnels, progress has slowed, 
with many of the miners replaced by xill.
A single stone giant works the rails leading from 
Room D44 throughout these tunnels. He goes to 
the various digging sites, loads the rock, and takes 
the rock to Room D77, where the delver dissolves 
the rubble. The stone giant has no interest in fight-
ing and flees in the face of well-armed PCs. He 
does not interact at all and only fights if prevented 
from fleeing.
All of the tunnels here are at least 10 ft. tall, extend-
ing to heights equal to the widths in larger tunnels 
and rooms. The floors are treacherous, prohibiting 
charges and run actions. PCs moving more than half 
speed must succeed a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) 
check or fall prone. All tunnels and rooms are dark 
unless otherwise specified in the rooms’ descriptions.
On Day 0 through Day 3, Chtrax sends his minions 
to explore these tunnels and to excavate the rooms 
to find the Vault. After Day 3, however, he focuses 
on Room D61 and the tarrasque’s progress through 
the adamantine bands. Consequently, the supplies, 
guards and materials move to other areas in the re-
gion, leaving this area virtually abandoned.
If the PCs have not yet stopped the tarrasque in 
Room D61 and are exploring this region after Day 3, 
treat all rooms featuring mining teams, the rooms 
with deep dwarves, duergar, grimlocks, and or der-
ro, as empty.
RAnDoM EnCoUnTERs
During Day 0 through Day 3, check for Random 
Encounters once every two hours the PCs explore this 
section. From Day 4 or later, roll for Random Encoun-
ters once per day.

functioning as an earthquake cast on 
the ceiling.
D69 . CAVED-IN ROOM
PCs moving down the tunnel to Room D77 and, suc-
ceeding a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, hear the 
following:
From the wall, you hear a faint scratching noise. 
You strain to listen, and think you hear cries 
for help. Trinkets, stone carvings and the like lie 
scattered on the floor near the base of a pile of 
loose rock.
Initial Attitude: Friendly
Encounter: An earthquake caved-in a large portion of 
the tunnels, trapping and killing many of Chtrax’s 
workers. Still alive and trapped inside this cave 
are 4 duergar and 6 deep dwarf slaves who ham-
mer at the walls for help. The sounds echo eerily 
throughout the tunnels outside. The duergar slaves 
joke about the sounds, but the deep dwarves leave 

331
offerings and secretly work at the walls to free their 
trapped comrades, when no one watches.
The slaves inside are half-starved, bruised and 
beaten. They lack the strength to dig themselves 
out and will succumb to the ravages of hunger and 
thirst by Day 5. The PCs can clear the rock and de-
bris where the wall is narrowest. A PC may roll a DC 
25 Intelligence check to find the narrowest wall. In 
one minute, without tools, a PC can clear rock and 
debris equal to five times their heavy encumbrance 
limit. With tools, they clear double this amount. 
Assume there is 3,000 lbs. of rock. 
The PCs may also tunnel through the rock. The 
walls have a thickness as indicated on the map and 
count as hewn stone. Alternatively, the PCs can 
use stone shape or similar magic to punch a hole 
through the walls.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Echoes 8
Tactics: If the PCs manage to break through the walls 
and free the slaves, the dwarves are friendly, offer-
ing to help the PCs in any way they can, even the 
duergar. The dwarves are equipped as below. These 
dwarves have the standard chances of carrying a xill 
egg inside them (see Region Introduction).
Trapped in a slide, and given their lowly status, 
they do not know much. They do know the general 
layout of the various sections in the region, at least 
by name, though they do not know much about the 
creatures dwelling in any particular rooms. They 
warn the Deep Mines house the most dangerous 
creature in the entire world and encourage the PCs 
to avoid those tunnels.

D70 . TRACK END
The rails of the track end abruptly, as the walls get 
tighter and the ceiling drops to 5 ft. Further, the 
tunnel twists and narrows further into a darkened 
crack. Dust covers the floor, and cobwebs clutter 
the cracks and crevices.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The rails end here. The slaves did not fin-
ish widening these tunnels to lay the track further. 
The tunnels ahead are hand dug, leading to the 
probes ending in watery doom.

D71 . PILE OF BONES
The narrow tunnel widens into a small grotto. Two 
more tunnels lead out of this room. The floor is 
rough slate, and clearly treacherous. There are pits 
and holes in the floor, filled with black stagnant 
water. The floor clearly slants to the right exit. 
Black bones with bits of rotted flesh are piled in 
a pile near the left wall. Otherwise, this room 
appears to be empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room once held the campsite for the 
expeditionary force. When they breached the under-
ground lake, this room flooded, and some fearsome 
subterranean aquatic monster devoured the inhab-
itants. Now, just their bones and a few puddles of 
toxic water remain. Foolish PCs who drink the water 
must succeed a DC 16 Constitution save or contract 
Blinding Sickness. 
 '
Blinding Sickness. If ingested, make a DC 16 Consti-
tution saving throw to resist. Incubation period 1d3 
days, damage 1d4 Strength (rach time victim takes 
2 or more damage from the disease, they must 
make another Constitution save or be permanent-
ly blinded).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs moving down the tunnel to Room D72 
must move at one-quarter speed. Moving faster 
requires the PCs to succeed a DC 15 Dexterity (Acro-
batics) check or slide down the tunnel to land in the 
murky waters and the vast sea of green slime below.

D72 . WATER-FILLED CAVE
The steeply angled tunnel ends on the shores of 
brackish water that gently laps against the sand. 
The watery room extends back into darkness, and 
there are no other visible exits.

332
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was originally connected to a 
network of deeper tunnels, but when the miners 
accidentally breached the underground lake, the 
room flooded, killing scores of miners, derro, and 
formian guards. Now, this room serves as one of 
the two entrances for these subterranean realms. 
It descends 30 ft. to the bottom. At the far end is 
a tunnel leading to the watery tunnels. Unfortu-
nately, this room is also the home for an enormous 
colony of aquatic green slime, resting just below 
the surface of the water, unseen for all the water’s 
contamination. It owes its massive size to corpses 
of the drowned beneath its surface.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: PCs entering the pool meet with a horrible 
surprise as green slime coats their bodies. The slime 
fills the entire room, beneath the water.
 '
Green Slime. This dungeon peril is a dangerous vari-
ety of normal slime. Green slime devours flesh and 
organic materials on contact and is even capable 
of dissolving metal. Bright green, wet, and sticky, 
it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches, 
reproducing as it consumes organic matter. It drops 
from walls and ceilings when it detects movement 
(and possible food) below.
A single 5-foot square of green slime deals 1d6 
points of Constitution damage per round while it 
devours flesh. On the first round of contact, the 
slime can be scraped off a creature (most likely de-
stroying the scraping device), but after that it must 
be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing damage 
to the victim as well). Anything that deals cold or 
fire damage, sunlight, or a lesser restoration spell 
destroys a patch of green slime. Against wood or 
metal, green slime deals 7 (2d6) points of damage 
per round. It does not harm stone.
GMs not wishing to expand this dungeon 
should remove the exit at the far end of the Room.
Treasure: Beneath the green slime, at the bottom of 
the pool, are 6 adamantine picks.
Scaling: N/A
D73 . XILL CAVE
The tunnel opens into a wide and awkwardly 
shaped chamber. Hanging 2 ft. above the floor from 
hooked chains descending from the 30 ft. ceiling, 
are seven corpses of derro, duergar, and dwarves. 
They are all in various states of decomposition. 
One thing unifies them, though they all feature 
terrible holes in their chests.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Seven xill cling to the backs of the hang-
ing carcasses, feeding. When the PCs arrive, allow 
PCs a Wisdom (Perception) check to detect them. 
If the PCs see them and take any action revealing 
their awareness, the xill attack. Otherwise, the xill 
are content to watch them while they eat.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: These xill are aggressive warriors, driven to 
barbarism after a life in these tunnels. They give no 
quarter. The xill use bite attacks to paralyze their 
foes first and destroy those still moving before im-
planting their eggs.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the Xill’s melee attack bonus by +2. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the number of xill to 
just four.
D74 . DEAD END
Aside from a few bones and scraps of sodden cloth, 
this dead-end tunnel is empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Soon after the waters flooding these tun-
nels receded, a crew of miners worked to salvage 
the mines. Unfortunately, their grimlock overseer 
was a bit overzealous, and drove them with its whip 
harder than normal. The damage caused by his 
abuse triggered the xill to emerge early from their 
hosts. The xill consumed the grimlock, leaving his 
bones here, before pulling the corpses of their hosts 
to Room D73. Now, this tunnel is empty, save for 
the bones.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A

Treasure: Beneath the grimlock’s bones is a +1 battle-
axe, masterwork whip and a potion of climbing.
Scaling: N/A
D75 . THE DROWNED GUARDIANS
Floating on the surface of the glistening waters are 
ten sodden corpses of dwarves. Where exposed to 
the air, they have rotted, explaining the stink.
Initial Attitude: N/A or Hostile
Encounter: If you would like to expand this dungeon 
to include subterranean depths of your own design, 
the corpses are deep dwarf zombies, animated by 
an aboleth necromancer living in the underground 
sea, and dispatched here to prevent intrusion. How-
ever, if you choose not to expand this dungeon, 
treat these corpses as just corpses, and remove the 
exits from the map.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If these creatures are indeed zombies, they 
move to attack as soon as the PCs come within 5 ft. 
of the shore. These creatures are mindless and fight 
to the death.

D76 . SOUNDER CREW
At the far end of this massive tunnel hums a six-
wheeled wagon carrying a metal cylindrical tank 
mounted in an iron cradle, with connecting hoses 
running to another reservoir. At the tank’s rear is 
a deep dwarf manipulating several levers, while 
towards the front, another dwarf presses a cone to 
the wall. In the smaller tunnel beyond are unusual 
creatures at work, using their cone-like heads and a 
loud sonic assault to erode the rock.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The odd device is a sounder (see Room 
D53) manned by two deep dwarf engineers. Four 
loyal destrachan use their destructive harmon-
ics to tunnel through the rock as directed by the 
sounder crew.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: At any sign of the PCs, the malevolent destra-
chan turn their harmonics on the party, while the 
deep dwarf engineers hide beneath the device.
The dwarves are terrified of the PCs and unswervingly 
loyal to Chtrax. They do not fight the PCs, but do 
not offer any assistance.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add three formian warriors to the group. To de-
crease the challenge, remove two of the destrachan.
D77 . DIGGING ZONE
This large cavern extends nearly 60 ft. across, with 
a ceiling just as high. Sifting down from above are 
constant streams of dust and pebbles, landing onto 
the back of an enormous cyclopean, an armed slug-
like creature situated in the room’s center. Duergar 
slaves scurry about feeding the thing rocks, before 
scrambling back before the monster’s bodily 
secretions dissolve them in addition to the stone. 
Two blind overseers lend an imposing physical 
presence and the bite of their whips to encourage 
the duergar to work harder.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: The massive central creature is a delver, 
who dissolves the rock chunks with its corrosive 
slime. It serves Chtrax, believing the xill holds its 
mate and brood hostage. Hauling the rock to the 
delver are ten duergar slaves and their grimlock 
overseers. The delver is disinterested in working, 
and so does not excavate the rock unless ordered, 
content to dissolve the rock brought to it instead. 
The delver remains here after Day 3, along with half 
of the duergar and one grimlock.
The farthest edge of the map may extend to 
more tunnels, more workers and other horrors at 
the GM’s discretion. If you do not wish to expand 
the dungeon, end with this room.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: When the PCs approach, allow the grimlocks 
Wisdom (Perception) check opposed by the PCs 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If they succeed, they 
order their forces to attack. The delver aids the 
grimlocks 50% of the time. If he does not aid the 
grimlocks, he either does nothing or sides with the 
PCs with a 50% chance of either.

334
The duergar enlarge and turn invisible, ma-
neuvering to gain flanks while the grimlocks drop 
their whips, draw their battleaxes and charge if 
possible. The delver, if it attacks, lashes out with its 
slam attacks against heavily armored foes, leaving 
the spellcasters for the grimlocks and duergar to 
deal with.
If both grimlocks die, the delver and the duergar 
surrender. The delver does not aid the PCs beyond 
this room, and instead moves toward the Great 
Hall to find its mate and brood.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each of the duergar slaves the rogue Sneak 
Attack ability (2d6). To decrease the challenge, re-
duce the number of duergar to five and remove the 
grimlocks altogether.
D78 . CONFUSED MINERS
The railed track ends up in a small alcove. Four 
duergar miners steadily dig a tunnel through 
the rock while a grimlock’s presence more than 
guarantees their continued labor is happening.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This crew of 4 duergar miners along with 
their grimlock foreman digs, unknowingly, toward 
the Great Hall. The confusing effects of the region 
have turned them around, and they can faintly 
hear sounds coming through the rock from the 
hall beyond.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs engage these miners, they fight 
to the death, thinking they are close to reaching 
Chtrax’s prize. The duergar use their spell-like 

335
abilities to gain advantage when able, while the 
grimlock battles the armored PCs.
Left to their own devices, the miners breach the 
wall of the Great Hall on Day 5, creating a tremor 
collapsing part of the ceiling onto a random struc-
ture. See Random Encounters in the Great Hall for 
details. After the tremors, Chtrax executes the min-
ers and their grimlock overseer, by dumping them 
all into the lava flow.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give the duergar slaves an additional damage die 
and +2 to attack rolls and give the grimlock the 
fighter Action Surge and Second Wind (1d10 + 5) 
abilities. To decrease the challenge, have the PCs 
surprise the miners.
D79 . MINERS
The railed track ends in a small alcove. A weird 
creature with a tubular mouth destroys the rock 
with a sonic attack, while dwarf slaves shovel away 
the rubble. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A destrachan destroys the rock with its 
destructive harmonics, while 4 infected deep dwarf 
slaves clear away the debris. These creatures are 
engrossed in their work, so are unlikely to notice 
the PCs, unless they draw attention to themselves 
in some egregious way. If so, the slaves and the 
destrachan fight to a suicidal death.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The slaves grapple the closest PC, while 
the destrachan uses its destructive harmonics to 
collapse the ceiling on the party’s rear ranks. If the 
deep dwarves gain a hold, the destrachan blasts 
them and the held victim with a flesh-destroying 
sonic attack.
The destrachan and its deep dwarf slaves hit the 
first adamantine barrier on Day 5. It takes them two 
days to break through each barrier. Therefore, these 
creatures eventually complete the xill master’s task 
on Day 12, but only if the PCs somehow stop the 
tarrasque first.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the deep dwarves with a derro handler. To 
decrease the challenge, replace the destrachan with 
a bulette.
D80 . RATS
The railed track ends in a small alcove. A rat swarm 
feeds on the carcass of a former slave. A light-
weight pick lies discarded on the floor.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: A lone deep dwarf miner thought of es-
caping from this region by secretly mining a tunnel 
into the floor of this cave when no one was looking. 
Instead, he found a nest of fiendish rats lying dor-
mant in a pocket in the earth. The rats boiled out 
of the hole and made short work of the poor dwarf. 
The swarm of fiendish rats is content to feast on the 
bones of the dwarf.
This room is empty after Day 4.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs provoke the rats, say by attacking 
or casting a spell, the rats turn on the lead PC, in 
a frenzy of bites and claws. The rats open with a 
smite-good attack, regardless of whether the oppo-
nent is good or not. The rats fight till death.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add six fiendish rat swarms that emerge on the 
second round of combat. To decrease the challenge, 
replace the fiendish rat swarm with a rat swarm.

D81 - D84 . THE DEVIL VAULT
Chtrax’s goal, the Devil Vault, is a nest of vile evil, a 
prison withstanding thousands of years, earthquakes, 
the rise and fall of civilizations, as it has never failed 
to contain the darkness within. Eons ago, before 
mankind stirred from the sleep of creation, Asrakhor 
the Undying, the Destroyer and the Void incarnate, 
surged madly in the planes and brought war to the 
heavens. Great celestial cities, infernal strongholds 
and even the halls of the gods succumbed in the 
clutches of his foul hand. Though the Nemesis’ de-
structive ability was a dire threat, his corrupting aura 
brought all manner of outsiders beneath his banner. 
From these fallen celestials rose a particularly cor-
rupted Solar called Kator. This fallen angel gathered 
to him a host of loyal followers and served the mad 
god and his fell purposes, laying siege to the gates 
of heaven. Thousands of years passed, with terrific 
losses to both sides. It was only when the good and 
evil gods joined forces that they were able to defeat 
Asrakhor and imprison him beyond reach in a cosmic 
prison for all eternity.
With the dark god at bay, there remained the 
matter of its servants. The evil gods demanded the 
destruction of these dark servants, but the good gods 
offered quarter, and the gods of light took respon-
sibility for their incarceration. The gods dispatched 
celestials to the Material Plane to construct a prison 
to contain these fallen celestials for all eternity.
The total area of the vault measures 140 ft. by 100 
ft., but the actual prison itself is small. Its size is 
deceptive however, for it originally held all 300,000 
of Asrakhor’s servants in a sphere appearing only 50 ft 
.in diameter. The sphere is actually a nexus to a pock-
et dimension large enough to house all of the fiends 
but encapsulated by a sphere of sacred force.
The borders of the Demiplane were not strong 
enough to contain the raw hate and evil within, so 
the celestial designers gave their lives to serve as 
conduits to fuel the energies required to reinforce 
the heavenly boundaries. The essence of four solars 
occupied the four corners of the vault, their inherent 
goodness enough to channel the energies of their 
divine creatures to buttress the magical barrier (the 
red lines in Room D81).
Even the sacrifice of the four archangels was not 
enough to guarantee the permanence of the prison. 
The builders coated the interior walls with truesilver 
from the natural deposits found throughout the area 
surrounding the site. Celestial craftsmen surround-
ed the vault with bands of magical adamantine and 
as long as those bands remained intact, they would 
generate an effect similar to a wall of force (the green 
lines, Room D82). Filling in the gaps are clouds of 
raw sacred magical energy, making the Vault inhos-
pitable for fiends, and lending to the magical imped-
iments preventing teleportation effects, plane travel 
and divination magic.
With these defenses in place, the gods and celes-
tials were confident in the vault’s defenses, and over 
time, expanded the dungeon, imprisoning more of 
Asrakhor’s minions, using inevitables, celestials and 
more to safeguard the world from the evil inside 
the massive dungeon. Eventually, the gods and the 
forces of good forgot about the massive complex, 
as their attention turned to the affairs of mortals 
and creation.
Now, Chtrax threatens the vault’s integrity, press-
ing forward with his minions. As he draws closer to 
his goals, the wards and defenses gradually fail until 
ultimately, when the tarrasque breaches the walls, 
the prison collapses, releasing Kator into the world 
once more. As noted in the introduction, if the PCs 
do nothing to stop the tarrasque, it breaches the first 
set of adamantine bands on Day 4, collapsing two of 
the walls of force and depleting the sacred energies 
within. The impediment on divination magic ends. 
On Day 5, the tarrasque breaches the second band 
of adamantine, collapsing another wall of force. The 
impediments on teleportation end in this region. On 
Day 6, the tarrasque breaks through the final ada-
mantine band, and the final wall of force collapses, 
dispersing all of the sacred energies and ending the 
plane travel impediments in this region. Finally, on 
Day 7, the tarrasque breaks inside rhe Devil Vault. 
With the vaults integrity destroyed, the solars’ essenc-
es fail and the reinforcement to the magical barri-
er collapses entirely. The sphere warps and twists, 
collapsing completely after 3 rounds, returning the 
devils to the Material Plane. Chtrax cannot place the 
collar and manacles on Kator before the devil and his 
legions overwhelm him.
As soon as the devils break free, they fight the tar-
rasque, led by the infamous Kator, with a mixture of 
spell-like abilities and the devils’ abilities to summon 

337
more of their kind. They quickly overrun the tarrasque 
and punch through the formian defenses, spilling 
throughout the region, slaughtering formians, derro, 
dwarves and other living things they encounter along 
the way. After one day, the devils conquer the entire 
region, and plot to conquer the rest of the dun-
geon. After two more weeks of feasting and terrible 
hunting, the army of devils march on the neighbor-
ing regions.
The release of the devils has a dynamic effect on 
the rest of this region. During the day of the devil 
raids, all the devils use their summon abilities to draw 
more of their kind into the region. They move quickly 
throughout the complex.
FOLLOW THIS TIMELINE:
Hours 0 to 3
Devils gain control of the 
Deep Mines.
Hours 4 to 5Devils conquer the Great Hall.
Hour 6
Devils take the Western and 
Northern Mines.
Hour 7Devils take the Old Mines.
Once the devils conquer the region, replace the 
inhabitants with the following creatures, regardless of 
whether the PCs defeated the original inhabitants.
The only way the PCs can save the day is to take 
the truesilver manacles and collar and place them on 
Kator. This is exceptionally difficult, as the pit fiend 
never sleeps and has no interest in wearing them. 
The PCs must ensnare the devil though a magic circle, 
or defeat the creature in combat, dealing nonlethal 
damage until he falls unconscious or is defeated in 
some other way. If they position the manacles and 
collar on the devil, they can use its wish to return all 
of the devils to prison. Be as lenient as possible on 
the wish’s wording unless the PCs are foolish enough 
to use the wish for themselves. If the PCs fail, what 
happens is up to the GM. Perhaps the gods return 
their attention to the lost prison and exert their influ-
ence to restore the devils to their prison. On the oth-
er hand, Kator could simply leave the dungeon from 
this region and unleash the Nemesis onto the Planes 
once more, for a campaign of epic proportions.

D85 - D103 . NORTHERN MINES
Encompassing Rooms D85 through D103, these 
blighted tunnels are a deadly gauntlet of pestilence, 
where despite the ravaging plagues wreaking havoc 
throughout, some mining continues. The traps are 
aplenty, lying in wait for interlopers who have no 
business exploring these tunnels. Commanding these 
mines is a tired and nearly broken formian myr-
march, whose control is tenuous at best. Fighting the 
plagues ravaging the tunnels has been no small feat 
and has claimed the lives of countless slaves, derro 
and formians. Making matters worse, a band of xill 
have organized and ambush miners, and formian 
sentries, stall the process for some esoteric purpose.
In a rare meeting between Chtrax and the myr-
march, the xill commanded the myrmarch’s forces to 
construct a bore to assist in the mining process, as 
the master was dissatisfied with the progress. Fur-
thermore, Chtrax did not intend to reveal this proj-
ect to the gnome, as it would create undue conflict 
between the artificer and the master. The command 
came three weeks ago, before the plagues and xill 
strikes. Hence, progress on the bore has been slow.
Unlike the other two formian myrmarchs, this one 
suspects the formian queen is dead at the hands of 
their master. If the PCs demonstrate evidence of 
this, and with some smooth talking, the myrmarch 
throws his lot in with the PCs to defeat the xill over-
lord. However, if the PCs betray him, he becomes 
an implacable enemy and hunts the PCs throughout 
the region.
All rooms here are dark unless otherwise specified. 
The walls are unworked stone and the ceiling aver-
ages 10 ft. in height, while smaller, narrow tunnels 
are only 5 ft. tall. Bones, trash, metal scrap and spider 
webs litter all the corridors and rooms, making 
charging impossible and forcing PCs to succeed a 
DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to run. The air is 
sulfurous and foul.

D86 . MOLDY ROOM
As you move further down the corridor, it gets 
colder. When you finally reach the mouth of the 
cave, you note a brown powdery substance fills 
the entire room, hanging in strands from floor to 
ceiling and covering the rocks. In the center of the 
room lies a gleaming longsword, in the grip of a 
dead humanoid. The room is exceedingly cold, and 
your breath puffs out in steam.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: When the waters poured into the tunnels 
from above, much of it collected here. The resulting 
moisture and the rotting flesh from the drowned 
made this an ideal location for various molds. Over 
time, the water evaporated, leaving a thriving colo-
ny of brown mold in its wake. The mold covers this 
room, so whenever anyone enters a 5 ft. space, they 
take 3d6 points of damage from each 5 ft. square of 
mold, for a total of 7d6 points of cold damage.
Encounter Condition: Flooded
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The corpse of Ulrad the Unlucky rots in 
the center of the room, a cursed fighter who found 
himself lost in the dungeon and finally crawled in 
here to die. All of his other equipment has long 
since rotted away, except for his particularly unlucky 
longsword, a -2 cursed adamantine longsword.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the brown mold with yellow mold. To de-
crease the challenge, shrink the area of the brown 
mold to just the central 10-ft.-by-10-ft. section.
D87 . MORE BODIES
The narrow tunnel extends deep into the rock. Four 
corpses with large gaping wounds in their chests 
fill the end of tunnel. Their tools, picks and shovels 
lie scattered about, rusting. The bodies look like 
they have been dead for a while.
Initial Attitude: N/A

no longer. Two of the corpses were duergar and the 
other two were deep dwarves. Their jaws have been 
removed to prevent speak with dead spells.

Encounter: Three xill hide at the end of the tunnel. 
Newly emerged from the bodies of three duergar 
miners, they have just killed the grimlock overseer 
and are making a meal of his remains. If anyone 
enters the tunnel, the xill hide in the shadows, wait-
ing for the opportunity to strike.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The xill are merciless combatants. If a lone 
scout enters the tunnel, two make grab attacks to 
hold the unfortunate victim steady, while a third 
tries to inject eggs. Against more opponents, the xill 
lash out with melee attacks, but keep at least one 
opponent alive to act as a host.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add two more xill. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one xill.
D89 . CHUTE TRAP
For PCs searching for secret doors, or creatures who 
notice such things, read the following text:
Something about this empty stretch of wall is 
suspicious. Perhaps it is the scuff marks on the 
floor, or the flash of something behind it, but you 
are certain you spy a secret door here.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Designed to snare the snoops, this secret 
door is more of a trap than a passage. PCs succeed-
ing at a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
notice scuff marks on the rock surrounding the 
door, similar to claw marks. The stone door itself 
is poorly concealed, requiring a DC 15 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check to locate. The door spins on 
a horizontal, central spindle, but pushes on a false 

342
vertical spindle, so pushing either side of the door 
causes the top to spin forward, while the bottom 
lifts the PC up and into the chute beyond. Opening 
the door is simple. PCs pushing on the door must 
succeed a DC 15 Dexterity save or tumble to the 
other side, sliding down the chute to fall in a spec-
tacular splash into the lava below. See lava in this 
region’s introduction for details.
Once in the lava, 1d6 magma mephits attack the 
PC. The unfortunate PC can swim out of the lava 
to reach the lip of the chute, taking damage as if 
immersed each round in the lava. Climbing back 
up the chute requires a DC 15 Strength (Athlet-
ics) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The magma mephits attack PCs in the lava. 
They are nearly mindless, so they favor claw attacks 
over breath weapons. Each round the PC fights the 
mephits in the lava there is a 20% chance for 1d6 
more steam and magma mephits to join the fight.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, double the number of attacking mephits. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the Dexterity 
save DC by -3.
D90 . SOUNDER
The large tunnel descends into the earth at a sharp 
angle. At the end of the tunnel, a large six-wheeled 
wagon carrying a metal cylindrical tank mounted 
on an iron cradle, with connecting hoses running 
to another reservoir of sorts hums as a deep 
dwarf manipulates several levers at the rear of the 
machine, while another dwarf presses the narrow 
end of a cone to the wall. Insect men stand guard, 
evaluating their progress.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: A sounder crew, consisting of two deep 
dwarves, tests the walls with harmonic resonances 
to see if they are any closer to the Vault. The sound-
er crew, if left alone, turns on the device to a narrow 
beam, mid-pulse with results as described in Room 
D53. The deep dwarf engineers are sick with cackle 
fever and frequently stop their detections while they 
suffer bouts of coughing. Furthermore, the disease 
has eroded their minds, so they have a 50% chance 
of switching the sounder up to a high pulse. Three 
formian warriors stand guard, watchful for xill 
saboteurs.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The PCs can negotiate with the formians, 
as the formians count the roaming xill among 
their enemies. PCs succeeding a DC 20 Charisma 
(Persuasion) check prevent combat from occurring 
and the formian warriors request the PCs to accom-
pany them to their myrmarch in Room D93. If the 
PCs agree, one of the formian warriors leads the 
PCs there.
PCs interacting with the deep dwarves must suc-
ceed DC 16 Constitution saves or catch cackle fever.
If the PCs engage the formians in melee, they fan 
out to gain flanks where possible and concentrate 
their attacks on the spellcasters first. The deep 
dwarves switch up the sounder to a high pulse in 
the hopes an arc will kill a PC.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the formian warriors’ hit points by +20. To 
decrease the challenge, have the formians start with 
a Friendly attitude.
D91 . DIGGING DELVER
Astride the back of a huge brown cyclopean slug 
monster rides a derro dressed in rags. The creature 
reaches out with its squiggly arms and liquefies 
the rock it touches. The air is acrid and foul. The 
mounted derro shrieks with pleasure when he swats 
his mount with his improvised riding crop.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly/Friendly
Encounter: A crazed derro rides atop a delver. Made 
even more insane by a nasty run of cackle fever, he 
is perilously close to comatose. With no concern 
for his actions, he commands the monster beneath 
him to find the prize at any cost. The delver, eager 
to find her mate who resides at Room D77, agrees 
in the hopes she can destroy as much of the region 
as she can. She tolerates the rider only because it 
serves her purpose.
If not stopped, the delver cuts a swathe across 
the dungeon, reaching the lava flow on the other 
side in 7 days.
Encounter Condition: N/A

343
Tactics: If the PCs make their presence known to the 
delver and her rider, the delver stops its dig-
ging. The delver is willing to talk with 
the PCs, but the derro is not. After 
three rounds of conversation, 
and if the PCs seem trust-
worthy, the delver crushes the 
derro, silencing him.
The delver is interested 
in any information the PCs 
have, especially details 
about what Chtrax’s 
intentions actually are. 
The delver does not 
know much, only that a 
myrmarch controls this 
section, and the formian 
workers spend their time 
constructing a massive 
drill. Once the PCs have 
finished speaking, she turns 
back to her digging, hoping to 
find her mate.
If the PCs attack, the delver and 
the rider charge the PCs, intent on 
destroying them. The delver concentrates her 
attacks at the armored PCs first, while the derro 
uses psychic thunderwave to disrupt spellcasters.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, change the Initial Attitude of the delver to 
Unfriendly. To decrease the challenge, remove the 
mad derro.
D92 . THE BORE
The tunnel slants down and opens into an 
enormous cave, filled with the din of industrial 
noise. Muted stone guardians stand at attention, 
blankly watching the workers toil. Duergar smiths 
forge the plates that the deep dwarf craftsmen 
shape into components for the large bore. Other 
slaves hoist the panels and other parts to the 
hive of activity, where formian workers labor to 
assemble a great bore. The cavern echoes the 
sounds of beating hammers, footfalls, and the 
occasional shout.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: Inside this half of the enormous cave, 
20 formian workers assemble the bore Chtrax 
commissioned in secret. Ten duergar smiths and 
their 8 deep dwarf assistants busily melt the metal 
fragments turned up from the rich iron veins in 
Rooms D101 and D102. Two stone golems stand 
ready to attack any intruder that is not a derro, 
dwarf, or formian taking a hostile action while 
in this room. Chtrax called for the bore once 
he lost patience with the gnome artificer Korus’ 
devices. The formian workers do not respond to 
conversation, though the duergar and deep dwarves 
direct PCs to Room D93.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Should the PCs fight the inhabitants of this 
room, the formian workers alert the myrmarch at 
Room D93, who in turn alerts the rest of the section 
to the presence of intruders. The stone giants close 
with the PCs, opening with their slow effect, before 
pummeling PCs with slam attacks. On the third 
round, the myrmarch and all the formian warriors 
from Room D93 join the fight.
Treasure: N/A

344
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add an additional stone golem. To decrease the 
challenge, remove one stone golem and delay the 
myrmarch’s arrival by 1d3 rounds.
D93 . FORMIAN HIVE
Mounds of stone and mud cover half of this large 
cavern. Several insect men move among the mound 
conversing, antennae twitching. In the center of 
these creatures stands a larger and more powerful 
figure who directs the smaller warriors through 
practice drills.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: The myrmarch in charge of this sec-
tion resides here, drilling his troops and honing 
their abilities to fight against the all-too frequent 
xill raids. With him are 10 formian warriors and a 
formian taskmaster with a dominated xill. From 
the captive xill, the myrmarch learned the xill in this 
section are conspiring to replace all of the formians, 
using the slaves as hosts for their eggs. This has 
fueled this myrmarch’s suspicions that all is not well 
with the queen, and the deal between Chtrax and 
the formians is nothing more than a ruse. Conse-
quently, the formian has no use for the derro and 
plots to use the new bore against the Great Hall and 
disrupt the entire operation.
With the arrival of the PCs, the myrmarch’s plans 
are in jeopardy unless the PCs can convince him 
they fight the same fight. This requires a DC 15 
Charisma (Persuasion) check to improve the form-
ian’s attitude. If the PCs succeed, the formian 
explains they served the great Hive Mother, T’chtch-
eralaz, until the xill master met with her some few 
months back. The formian myrmarchs received 
instruction from their leader to follow the com-
mands of the xill as if they were her own. Now, they 
control the mining operations, truesilver extraction 
and security throughout the complex.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs enter the room, itching for a fight, 
they find one. A fight with the formians here draws 
the attention of the stone golems in Room D92, 
who arrive to face the PCs on round 3. The formian 
taskmaster sends the xill to fight the spellcaster 
PCs, while it tries to dominate the warrior PCs. 
Meanwhile, the warriors charge into the combat, 
working to gain flanks where possible, and to 
separate the PCs from the main body, while the 
myrmarch employs its spell-like abilities against 
chaotic PCs. The myrmarch and his minions fight to 
the death.
If the PCs slay the myrmarch, all formians in this 
section have disadvantage on all attacks, saves and 
checks. In addition, they lose access to their hive 
mind ability.
If the PCs befriend the formians, they can rest 
and heal here worry-free. The myrmarch refuses 
to make an assault against the Great Hall until the 
bore is ready. The formian workers complete the 
bore on Day 8, far too late to stop the devils from 
breaking free.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the formian warriors’ hit points by +20. 
To decrease the challenge, delay the stone golem’s 
arrival by 1d4 rounds.

Tools, junk and debris fill the end of this hot tunnel. 
There are no apparent exits, the trash is immobile.

D96 . SENTRY
A large insect guard stands watch here, periodically 
looking into the room behind it and then testing 
the air with its antennae.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: A formian warrior stands guard here, 
keeping an eye out for hatching xill eggs, unruly 
slaves or any other disturbance disrupting the 
integrity of this section. He redirects any questions 
posited to him, back to the myrmarch in Room D93.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs attack this guard, it alerts the 
myrmarch, if it still lives, in Room D93. Thereafter, 
it fights defensively, until reinforcements arrive. It 
fights to the death, regardless of whether reinforce-
ments arrive.
The myrmarch sends 1d4 more formian warriors to 
aid the sentry. These reinforcements, if the PCs did 
not destroy them in Room D93, arrive in 2 rounds.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a gorgon to this encounter. To decrease the 
challenge, remove the formian warrior.
D97 . SLAVE ENCAMPMENT
This large cavern rivals the one you just came from, 
but instead of hard-working slaves, you encounter 
mostly empty bedrolls, laying in neat and organized 
rows. At one time, this room probably held some 
50 or more slaves. Now, just a few dwarves recline, 
nursing injuries, or stealing a few hours of sleep 
before they return to work.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: Eight diseased deep dwarf slaves rest 
here. All have a random disease, as determined by 
the GM. The dwarves are not interested in conver-
sation, just rest. If the PCs cure a dwarf, they gain 
an ally for the rest of their time in this region. Oth-
erwise, these dwarves are no threat to the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (any) 20
Tactics: Count these dwarves as noncombatants. 
They do not fight and lack the means to defend 
themselves.
Treasure: The dwarves own nothing but their rags. 
There is no treasure in this room.

D98 . DEBRIS
This small niche stinks of refuse. Its purpose is 
made clear by the hole in the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This place serves as a dump for trash. Ev-
ery 15 minutes the PCs spend in this room require a 
DC 18 Constitution save against disease.

D99 . GRAFFITI
The railed track leads down a long and narrow 
tunnel. About midway down it is a vast painting, 
a caricature of a red-skinned, horned bug with its 
finger up its nose.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: In a small act of rebellion, some brave 
denizen painted a caricature of Chtrax here.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 6
Tactics: If the PCs can read dwarven they understand 
the crude but uninformative graffiti. Otherwise, it 
looks like a crudely drawn bug with demon horns.

D100 . SLOPED ROOM
The track ends in a hot light-filled room, emanating 
warmth from luminescent fungi growing on the 
walls. The floor steeply descends to two tunnels 
branching off into the darkness.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Hot geothermal gases formed this 
unusual cave. The moisture lent an atmosphere 
hospitable to these harmless and glowing plants. 
Weeks ago, the miners came across this place and 
continued to dig deeper into the earth. What they 
did not realize was the weird atmosphere in this 
room weakened their immune system, imposing a 
-4 penalty to all saves against disease. As a result, 
many of the miners succumbed to an outbreak of 
disease, spread by poor water and stale air.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs making a lot of noise here may attract 
the attention of the xill lurking in the tunnels of 
Rooms D101 and D102. Allow the xill to make 
Wisdom (Perception) checks opposed by the PCs 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If they succeed, the xill 
emerge in 1d2 rounds to investigate.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D101 . MINE TUNNEL
This narrow tunnel extends nearly thirty feett 
before branching into two more tunnels, ending 
in darkness.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Hidden in the shadows of this tunnel are 
eight xill. These creatures frequently make raids 
against the dwarves and formian in Rooms D92 and 
D93, but between combats, they return here to rest. 
These xill have designs on taking over the entire 
region, one section at a time.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the xill hear the PCs in Room D100, or if 
the PCs enter their tunnels, the xill creep forward as 
quietly as they can to ambush the PCs. These xill are 
relatively young and are not very intelligent. They 
fight to the death, trying to implant as many eggs 
as they can.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
make one of the xill an 8th-level wizard. To decrease 
the challenge, remove two xill.
D102 . MINE
This tunnel is as quiet as it is dark. It extends some 
30 feet before it branches into two more tunnels 
ending in darkness.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These tunnels are empty, cleared by the 
neighboring xill.
Encounter Condition: [Ambush], Echoes 6
Tactics: If a Random Encounter occurs here, it gains 
the benefit of the Ambush Encounter Condition.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D103 . BURIAL VAULT
The air quickly sours as you round the corner. 
At the end of the tunnel is a wide room filled 
with corpses, twitching with vermin. Three odd 
reptilian creatures spew viscous streams of fluid 
onto the bodies, causing smoke to rise where the 
droplets fall.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: When a slave in this section dies, the 
dwarves carry the corpse to this room to be dis-
solved by the three digesters. The digesters are 
always listening for the approach of fresh bodies 
but have learned not to attack formians or dwarves.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If a formian or dwarf accompanies the PCs, 
the digesters do not attack. Otherwise, all three 
digesters turn their acid spray onto the PCs. After-
wards, they charge into melee, attacking the closest 
PC first. The digesters use their acid spray as often 
as possible, fighting until they are reduced to 18 
hit points or less. They then retreat into the deeper 
recesses of the cave.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the hit points of the digesters by +20. To 
decrease the challenge, remove one digester.

Death burst. When the bottle demon dies, it explodes 
in a burst of sharp dust and icy shards. Each creature 
within 5 feet of it must then succeed on a DC 12 Con-
stitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute and

remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a cave 
formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite.
Smite (1/day). On hitting with a Bite attack against a 
Good-aligned creature, deal 1d4 extra points of radi-

ACTIONS
Crush. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
creature. Hit: (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the 
target is Medium or smaller and the fiendish dark-
mantle has advantage on the attack roll, it attaches 
by engulfing the target’s head, and the target is also 
blinded and unable to breathe while the darkmantle 
is attached in this way.
While attached to the target, the darkmantle can 
attack no other creature except the target but has 
advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle’s speed 
also becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to its 
speed, and it moves with the target.
A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a 
successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its 
turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target 
by using 5 feet of movement.
Darkness Aura (1/day). A 15-foot radius of magical 
darkness extends out from the fiendish darkman-
tle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The 
darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains 
concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating 
on a spell). Darkvision can’t penetrate this darkness, 
and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the 
darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a 
spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light 
is dispelled.

Shapechanger. Longtail can use his action to poly-
morph into a rat-humanoid hybrid or into a giant rat, 
or back into his true form, which is humanoid. His 
statistics, other than his size, are the same in each 
form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying is not 
transformed. He reverts to his true form if he dies.
Keen Smell. Longtail has advantage on Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks that rely on smell.
Evasion. When Longtail is subjected to an effect that 
allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take 
only half damage, he instead takes no damage if he 
succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage 
if he fails.
Share Spells. Longtail can cast spells through Achsyyx 
as if Achsyyx were casting the spell (still uses Longtail’s 
spell slots). In addition, Longtail can choose to have 
any spell he casts on himself also affect Achsyyx if 
Achsyyx is within 5 feet of Longtail at the casting.

cerer spells:

frost, poison spray

shield, sleep

 

to alter his spells:
Quickened Spell. (2 points) When he casts a spell with 
a casting time of 1 action, the casting time changes to 
a bonus action for this casting.
Twinned Spell. (points equal to the spell’s level, cantrip 
costs 1) When he casts a spell that can target only one 
creature and does not have a range of self, Longtail 
targets a second creature with the same spell. Twinned 
spell is not that useful as only his cantrips (and maybe 

360
dispel magic) are single targets; maybe something else 
would be better?
ACTIONS
Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only). Longtail 
makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite. In 
place of one attack, he can use a cantrip.
Bite (Rat or Hybrid Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack:

option can be used at a time and only at the end of 
another creature’s turn. Longtail regains spent leg-
endary actions at the start of his turn.
Hold/Open Portal. Longtail can attempt a DC 15 In-
telligence (Arcana) check to open the gateway. If an-
other creature is attempting to close it, this legendary 
action initiates an opposed check instead.
Escape. Longtail can move up to his movement 
speed without provoking attacks of opportunity.

cast one of his spells.

Chameleon Skin. The troglodyte has advantage on 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.
Stench. Any creature other than a troglodyte that 
starts its turn within 15 feet of the troglodyte must 
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be 
poisoned until the start of the creature’s next turn. On 
a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to 
the stench of all troglodytes for 10 minutes.

 
Cantrips (at will): sacred flame, thaumaturgy,

Challenge 4 (1,100 XP)
Pretender King. In his presence, the goblins fight with 
impossible fervor. His subjects are immune to the 
frightened condition while within 100 ft of him. If a 
melee or ranged attack strikes Argliss while a goblin 
is within 5 ft., that goblin dives in the way and takes 
the hit instead. Should Argliss be forced to transform 
and flee, these benefits are lost, and all goblins af-
fected are frightened of the PCs for one turn. It is up 
to the DM’s discretion whether or not this breaks the 
goblins’ morale completely.
Ambusher. Argliss has advantage on attack rolls 
against any creature he has surprised.
Doppelganger Ancestry. Argliss has advantage on sav-
ing throws against being charmed, and magic can’t 
put him to sleep.
Shapechanger. As an action, Argliss can shape-change 
into a medium or smaller humanoid it has seen, or 
back into its true form. Any equipment he is wear-
ing is transformed. If Argliss dies, he reverts to his 
true form.
Vest of escape. Argliss’ vest, combined with his 
shape-changing abilities, lets him wriggle from any 
bind he is put in easily. PCs that wear the vest find 
these benefits conferred similarly, granting ad-
vantage on any check made to resist grapples and 
escape bonds.
ACTIONS
Multiattack. Argliss makes three Dagger attacks. 
He can replace one attack with a use of the Wand 
of Wonder.
Silver Dagger. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 
5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage. If 
Argliss has advantage on this attack roll add 1d6 to 
the weapon damage.
Necklace of Fireballs. Argliss may cast fireball at 
3rd and 5th level without expending a spell slot or 
material requirements. He may do this once for 
each spell level before his necklace has permanently 
exhausted itself.
Wand of Wonder. Argliss carries a “royal scepter” 
that is a crudely gilded Wand of Wonder. Each uses 
expends one of its 7 charges.
POSSESSIONS
Silver dagger, Crown of the Goblin King (Headband of Intellect), Scepter of the Goblin King (Wand of Wonder), 
necklace of fireballs (one 3rd-level fireball and one 5th-level fireball, does not recharge).

as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
Corrosive Form. A creature that touches the pudding 
or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 ft. of it 
takes 9 (2d8) acid damage. Any non-magical weap-
on made of metal or wood that hits the pudding 
corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes 
a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage 
rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is de-
stroyed. Non-magical ammunition made of metal or 
wood that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing 
damage. The pudding can dissolve through 2 inches 
of non-magical wood or metal per round.
Spider Climb. The pudding can climb difficult sur-
faces, including upside down on ceilings, without 
needing to make an ability check.
ACTIONS
Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage plus 18 
(4d8) acid damage. In addition, non-magical armor worn by the target is partly dissolved and takes permanent 
and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.

389
Engulf (recharge 5-6). The pudding moves up to its speed, engulfing Large or smaller creatures in its way. 
Whenever the pudding enters a creature’s space, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw 
or be engulfed, immediately suffering 22 (4d10) acid damage.
An engulfed creature is restrained (escape DC 16) and cannot breathe, takes 22 (4d10) acid damage if it ends 
its turn still engulfed, and moves with the pudding. Immediately, and each time it ends its turn engulfed, the 
creature’s equipment suffers the deleterious effects of its Corrosive Form and Pseudopod.
REACTIONS
Split. When a pudding that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two 
new puddings if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new pudding has hit points equal to half the original pud-
ding’s, rounded down. New puddings are one size smaller than the original pudding.

Ooze Cube. The cube takes up its entire space. Other 
creatures can enter the space, but a creature that 
does so is subjected to the cube’s Engulf and has 
disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside 
the cube can be seen but have total cover. A creature 
within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a 
creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires 
a successful DC 14 Strength check, and the creature 
making the attempt takes 14 (4d6) acid damage. The 
cube can hold only one large creature or up to four 
medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time. 
Transparent. Even when the cube is in plain sight, it 
is invisible to every creature that hasn’t spotted it. A 
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals 
the cube as a hazy outline to the creature that made 
the check. A creature that enters the cube’s space 
while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube 
and is subjected to its Engulf, as described under 
Ooze Cube.
ACTIONS
Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 
ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) acid damage.
Engulf. The cube moves up to its speed. While 
doing so, it can enter large or smaller creatures’ 
spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature’s space, 
the creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving 
throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose 
to be pushed 5 ft. back or to the side of the cube. A 
creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the 
consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed 
save, the cube enters the creature’s space and the 
creature takes 14 (4d6) acid damage and is engulfed. 
The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, 
and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each 
of the cube’s turns. When the cube moves, the en-
gulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature 
can try to escape by taking an action to make a 
DC 14 Strength check. On a success, the creature 
escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet 
of the cube.
Slimy Thoughts. The ooze establishes telepathic 
contact with one creature within 30 ft. of the ooze, 
but its thought processes are so alien they regis-
ter on humanoid minds as a psychic assault. The 
target creature takes 22 (5d8) psychic damage or 
half damage with a successful DC 12 Intelligence 
saving throw.

up to 20 ft. in diameter. When the wall appears, each 
enemy in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest

end up on unless the creature is incapacitated. The 
creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or 
half as much damage on a successful one. The wall

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the tarrasque fails a sav-
ing throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Magic Resistance. The tarrasque has advantage on sav-
ing throws against spells and other magical effects.
Reflective Carapace. Any time the tarrasque is targeted 
by a magic missile spell, a line spell such as lightning bolt 
or sunbeam, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, 
roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 
6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected 
at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, 
turning the caster into the target.
Siege Monster. The tarrasque deals double damage to 
objects and structures.
ACTIONS
Multiattack. The tarrasque uses its Frightful Presence. 
It then makes four attacks: one with its bite, one with its 
claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. It can 
use its Swallow instead of its bite.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one 
target. Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the 
target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until 
this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the 
tarrasque can’t bite another target.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one 
target. Hit: 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.
Horns. Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., 
one target. Hit: 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage.
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one 
target. Hit: 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If 
the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 
Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Frightful Presence. Each creature of the tarrasque’s 
choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must suc-
ceed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be fright-
ened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvan-
tage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending 
the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving 
throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the crea-
ture is immune to the tarrasque’s Frightful Presence 
for the next 24 hours.
Swallow. The tarrasque makes one bite attack against 
a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack 
hits, the target takes the bite’s damage, is swallowed, 
and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is 
blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks 
and other effects outside the tarrasque, and takes 56 
(16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tar-
rasque’s turns.
If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a sin-
gle turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must 
succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the 
end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed crea-
tures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of it. If 
the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer 
restrained and can escape from the corpse by using 30 
feet of movement, exiting prone.

LEGENDARY ACTIONS

tion can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The tarrasque regains spent legendary 
actions at the start of its turn.
Attack. The tarrasque makes one claw attack or tail attack.
Move. The tarrasque moves up to half its speed.
Chomp (Costs 2 Actions). The tarrasque makes one bite attack or uses its Swallow.

throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

check. Each check inflicts 4 (1d8) slashing damage to
