# Spells (Part 6)

*This file contains a continuation from the previous spell section.*

the invisibility ends immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.

As a Magic action, you can move the illusory double up to twice your Speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It is intangible and invulnerable.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is.

### Misty Step
**Level 2 Conjuration** (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

---

### Modify Memory
**Level 5 Enchantment** (Bard, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the target also has the Incapacitated condition and is unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity, change its memory of the event's details, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you finish describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as a false memory of how much the creature enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature.

A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7 spell slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any time in the creature's past (level 9 spell slot).

### Moonbeam
**Level 2 Evocation** (Druid)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a moonseed leaf)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.

When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the Polymorph spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 2.

### Move Earth
**Level 6 Transmutation** (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature shovel)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 2 hours

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.

At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect within range.

This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

---

### Nondetection
**Level 3 Abjuration** (Bard, Ranger, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** 8 hours

For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from Divination spells. The target can be a willing creature, or it can be a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can't be targeted by any Divination spell or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

---

### Passwall
**Level 5 Transmutation** (Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

A passage appears at a point that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, ceiling, or floor) within range and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening's dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.

When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.

---

### Pass without Trace
**Level 2 Abjuration** (Druid, Ranger)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (ashes from burned mistletoe)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You radiate a concealing aura in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and each creature you choose have a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and leave no tracks.

---

### Phantasmal Force
**Level 2 Illusion** (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli.

The target can take a Study action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with it. For example, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall.

An affected target can even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

---

### Phantasmal Killer
**Level 4 Illusion** (Bard, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusion of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d10 Psychic damage and has Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the spell ends.

For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 4.

---

### Phantom Steed
**Level 3 Illusion** (Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses the Riding Horse stat block (see "Monsters"), except it has a Speed of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes any damage.

---

### Planar Ally
**Level 6 Conjuration** (Cleric)

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a Celestial, an Elemental, or a Fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM's choice).

When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.

Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.

A task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 GP per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.

After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.

---

### Planar Binding
**Level 5 Abjuration** (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a jewel worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** 24 hours

You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of the inverted version of the Magic Circle spell to trap it while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your commands to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your commands to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your commands completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The duration increases with a spell slot of level 6 (10 days), 7 (30 days), 8 (180 days), and 9 (366 days).

---

### Plane Shift
**Level 7 Conjuration** (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth 250+ GP and attuned to a plane of existence)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as a specific city on the Elemental Plane of Fire or palace on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination, as determined by the GM.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

---

### Plant Growth
**Level 3 Transmutation** (Bard, Druid, Ranger)

**Casting Time:** Action (Overgrowth) or 8 hours (Enrichment)  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting time you use determines whether the spell has the Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below.

**Overgrowth.** Choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.

**Enrichment.** All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 365 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. They can benefit from only one Plant Growth per year.

---

### Poison Spray
**Necromancy Cantrip** (Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You spray toxic mist at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 Poison damage.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by 1d12 when you reach levels 5 (2d12), 11 (3d12), and 17 (4d12).

---

### Polymorph
**Level 4 Transmutation** (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You attempt to transform a creature that you can see within range into a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into a Beast form for the duration. That form can be any Beast you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level if it doesn't have a Challenge Rating). The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point Dice. See the "Animals" section of "Monsters" for a sample of Beast stat blocks.

The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the Beast form. These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points left.

The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.

---

### Power Word Heal
**Level 9 Enchantment** (Bard, Cleric)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Component:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its Hit Points.

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Component:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 Hit Points or fewer, it has the Stunned condition. Otherwise, its Speed is 0 until the start of your next turn.

The Stunned target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.

---

### Prayer of Healing
**Level 2 Abjuration** (Cleric, Paladin)

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to five creatures of your choice who remain within range for the spell's entire casting gain the benefits of a Short Rest and also regain 2d8 Hit Points. A creature can't be affected by this spell again until that creature finishes a Long Rest.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.

---

### Prestidigitation
**Transmutation Cantrip** (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Up to 1 hour

You create a magical effect within range. Choose the effect from the options below. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time.

**Sensory Effect.** You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.

**Fire Play.** You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

**Clean or Soil.** You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.

**Minor Sensation.** You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.

**Magic Mark.** You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.

**Minor Creation.** You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand. It lasts until the end of your next turn. A trinket can deal no damage and has no monetary worth.

### Prismatic Spray
**Level 7 Evocation** (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Eight rays of light flash from you in a 60-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll 1d8 to determine which color ray affects it, consulting the Prismatic Rays table.

#### Prismatic Rays

| 1d8 | Ray |
|:---:|-----|
| 1 | **Red.** Failed Save: 12d6 Fire damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. |
| 2 | **Orange.** Failed Save: 12d6 Acid damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. |
| 3 | **Yellow.** Failed Save: 12d6 Lightning damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. |
| 4 | **Green.** Failed Save: 12d6 Poison damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. |
| 5 | **Blue.** Failed Save: 12d6 Cold damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. |
| 6 | **Indigo.** Failed Save: The target has the Restrained condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the Petrified condition until it is freed by an effect like the Greater Restoration spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. |
| 7 | **Violet.** Failed Save: The target has the Blinded condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (GM's choice). |
| 8 | **Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice, rerolling any 8. |

---

### Prismatic Wall
**Level 9 Abjuration** (Bard, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point within range. Alternatively, you shape the wall into a globe up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within range. The wall lasts for the duration. If you position the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the spell ends instantly without effect.

The wall sheds Bright Light within 100 feet and Dim Light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate when you cast the spell can pass through and be near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute.

The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature reaches into or passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the layers. Each layer forces the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described in the Prismatic Layers table.

The wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the duration. Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic can affect only the violet layer.

#### Prismatic Layers

| Order | Effects |
|:-----:|---------|
| 1 | **Red.** Failed Save: 12d6 Fire damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. Additional Effects: Nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed if it takes at least 25 Cold damage. |
| 2 | **Orange.** Failed Save: 12d6 Acid damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. Additional Effects: Magical ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed by a strong wind (such as the one created by Gust of Wind). |
| 3 | **Yellow.** Failed Save: 12d6 Lightning damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. Additional Effects: The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 60 Force damage. |
| 4 | **Green.** Failed Save: 12d6 Poison damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. Additional Effects: A Passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. |
| 5 | **Blue.** Failed Save: 12d6 Cold damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. Additional Effects: The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 25 Fire damage. |
| 6 | **Indigo.** Failed Save: The target has the Restrained condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the Petrified condition until it is freed by an effect like the Greater Restoration spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. Additional Effects: Spells can't be cast through this layer, which is destroyed by Bright Light shed by the Daylight spell. |
| 7 | **Violet.** Failed Save: The target has the Blinded condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (GM's choice). Additional Effects: This layer is destroyed by Dispel Magic. |

### Private Sanctum
**Level 4 Abjuration** (Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead)  
**Duration:** 24 hours

You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a Cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration.

When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any of the following properties:

- Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including Darkvision) through it.
- Sensors created by Divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
- Creatures in the area can't be targeted by Divination spells.
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for 365 days makes the spell last until dispelled.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can increase the size of the Cube by 100 feet for each spell slot level above 4.

---

### Produce Flame
**Conjuration Cantrip** (Druid)

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Fire damage.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

---

### Programmed Illusion
**Level 6 Illusion** (Bard, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (jade dust worth 25+ GP)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific trigger occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot Cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the trigger you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes, after which the illusion can be activated again.

The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible phenomena that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes the Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

---

### Project Image
**Level 7 Illusion** (Bard, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 500 miles  
**Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of yourself worth 5+ GP)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you, but it is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

You can see through the illusion's eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. As a Magic action, you can move it up to 60 feet and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes the Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

### Protection from Energy
**Level 3 Abjuration** (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a flask of Holy Water worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Concentration up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against creatures that are Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have Disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be possessed by or gain the Charmed or Frightened conditions from them. If the target is already possessed, Charmed, or Frightened by such a creature, the target has Advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

---

### Protection from Poison
**Level 2 Abjuration** (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)

### Raise Dead
**Level 5 Necromancy** (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)

**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 500+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

With a touch, you revive a dead creature if it has been dead no longer than 10 days and it wasn't Undead when it died.

The creature returns to life with 1 Hit Point. This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected the creature at the time of death.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to D20 Tests. Every time the target finishes a Long Rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it becomes 0.

### Resilient Sphere
**Level 4 Abjuration** (Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a glass sphere)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A shimmering sphere encloses a Large or smaller creature or object within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can take an action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's Speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A Disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside.

When the creature takes damage of the chosen type before the spell ends, the creature reduces the total damage taken by 1d4. A creature can benefit from this spell only once per turn.

The creature returns to life with all its Hit Points. This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected the creature at the time of death. This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to D20 Tests. Every time the target finishes a Long Rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it becomes 0.

All creatures and objects in that area that aren't anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the top of the Cylinder. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall upward.

If a ceiling or an anchored object is encountered in this upward fall, creatures and objects strike it just as they would during a downward fall. If an affected creature or object reaches the Cylinder's top without striking anything, it hovers there for the duration. When the spell ends, affected objects and creatures fall downward.

At the rope's upper end, an Invisible 3-foot-by-5-foot portal opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends. That space can be reached by climbing the rope, which can be pulled into or dropped out of it.

The space can hold up to eight Medium or smaller creatures. Attacks, spells, and other effects can't pass into or out of the space, but creatures inside it can see through the portal. Anything inside the space drops out when the spell ends.
