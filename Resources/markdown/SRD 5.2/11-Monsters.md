Monsters
Stat Block Overview
A monster has a stat block that contains the rules 
necessary to use it in the game. Stat blocks are di-
vided into the following parts:
Name and General Details. The name of the mon-
ster is followed by its size, creature type (along 
with any descriptive tags), and alignment.
Combat Highlights. Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed, 
and Initiative are provided here.
Ability Scores. A monster’s ability scores, ability 
modifiers, and saving throws are listed here.
Other Details. The monster’s Senses, Languages, 
and CR entries appear here. Additional details ap-
pear in some monsters, such as skill proficiencies, 
Resistances, Immunities, and Gear. If a monster 
lacks those details, entries for them don’t appear.
Traits. Monster characteristics that are active at all 
times or during certain situations appear here.
Actions. The monster can take the actions here in 
addition to those in “Playing the Game.”
Bonus Actions. This section provides a monster’s 
Bonus Actions, if any.
Reactions and Legendary Actions. These sections 
provide Reactions and Legendary Actions, if any.
Parts of a Stat Block
The rules for a stat block are detailed in “Rules Glos-
sary” and in this section.
Size
A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, 
or Gargantuan. If size options are presented, you 
choose the creature’s size from those options. See 
“Playing the Game” for information on size.
Creature Type
Each monster has a tag that identifies the type of 
creature it is. Certain spells, magic items, class fea-
tures, and other effects in the game interact in spe-
cial ways with creatures of a particular type.
    The game includes the following creature types, 
which have no rules of their own:
Aberrations are utterly alien beings, such as abo-
leths and cloakers.
Beasts are non-Humanoid natural creatures, like 
horses and wolves, as well as most giant animals.
Celestials are magical creatures, such as angels and 
pegasi, with ties to the Upper Planes.
Constructs are magically created creatures such as 
homunculi and shield guardians.
Dragons are scaly beings of ancient origin, such as 
red dragons and wyverns.
Elementals are beings from the Elemental Planes, 
such as efreet and water elementals.
Fey are creatures tied to the Feywild or the forces 
of nature, such as dryads and goblins.
Fiends are creatures tied to terrifying Lower 
Planes, such as balors and hell hounds.
Giants are towering beings with humanlike shapes, 
like fire giants and trolls.
Humanoids are people defined by their roles and 
professions, such as mages, pirates, and warriors. 
They include members of varied species.
Monstrosities are unnatural creatures with 
strange origins, such as mimics and owlbears.
Oozes are gelatinous creatures, including black 
puddings and gelatinous cubes.
Plants are sentient vegetation and fungal monsters, 
such as shambling mounds and treants.
Undead are spirits and the reanimated dead, such 
as ghosts, vampires, and zombies.
Descriptive Tags
A monster might have one or more tags in parenthe-
ses following its type. Such tags provide additional 
categorization and have no rules of their own, but 
certain game effects might refer to them.
Alignment
The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is 
a default suggestion of how to roleplay the monster, 
inspired by its traditional role in the game or real- 
world folklore. Change a monster’s alignment to 
suit your storytelling needs. The Neutral alignment, 
in particular, is an invitation for you to consider 
whether an individual leans toward one of the other 
alignments.
    “Character Creation” describes the nine align-
ments and unaligned creatures.
Armor Class
A monster’s Armor Class (AC) includes its natural 
armor, Dexterity, gear, and other defenses. See 
“Playing the Game” for information on Armor Class.
Initiative
The Initiative entry specifies the monster’s Initia-
tive modifier followed by the monster’s Initiative 
score in parentheses. Use the modifier when you 
roll to determine a monster’s Initiative. A monster’s 
Initiative modifier is typically equal to its Dexterity 
modifier, but some monsters have additional mod-
ifiers, such as Proficiency Bonus, applied to that 
number.
    If you don’t want to roll a monster’s Initiative, use 
the Initiative score as the monster’s Initiative in 
combat. Initiative is further detailed in “Playing the 
Game.”

Running a MonsteR
To ensure a monster acts in accordance with its 
Challenge Rating, follow these rules during combat:
Special Abilities. If the monster has a special abil-
ity that deals a lot of damage but has a limited 
number of uses, such as a recharging breath 
weapon or a spell it can cast only once per day, 
have it use that special ability as quickly and as 
often as possible.
Multiattack. If the monster has Multiattack, have 
it use Multiattack on any of its turns in which 
it’s not using one of its more powerful abilities.
Bonus Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions. If 
the monster has Bonus Actions, Reactions, or 
Legendary Actions in its stat block, make sure it 
uses them as often as it can.
Hit Points
A monster’s Hit Points are presented as a number 
followed by parentheses, where the monster’s Hit 
Point Dice are provided, along with any contribu-
tion from its Constitution. Either use the number for 
the monster’s Hit Points or roll the die expression in 
parentheses to determine the monster’s Hit Points 
randomly; don’t use both.
    A monster’s size typically determines the die used 
to calculate its Hit Points, as shown in the Hit Dice 
by Size table.
Hit Dice by Size
Monster SizeHit DieAverage HP per Die
Tinyd42½
Smalld63½
Mediumd84½
Larged105½
Huged126½
Gargantuand2010½
A monster’s Constitution modifier is multiplied by 
the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result 
is added to its Hit Points. For example, if a monster 
has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit 
Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 Hit Points (average 11).
    For more on Hit Points, see “Playing the Game.”
Speed
The Speed entry specifies a monster’s Speed. Some 
monsters have one or more of the following speeds: 
Burrow, Climb, Fly, Swim. Rules for Speed and these 
specials speeds appear in “Rules Glossary.”
Ability Scores
Every monster has six ability scores along with 
corresponding ability score modifiers and saving 
throw modifiers. For more information on ability 
scores and saving throws, see “Playing the Game.”
Skills
The Skills entry specifies a monster’s skill profi-
ciencies, if any. For example, a monster that is very 
perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wis-
dom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A 
skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability 
modifier and its Proficiency Bonus. Other modifiers 
might apply.
Resistances and Vulnerabilities
These entries list a monster’s Resistances and Vul-
nerabilities, if any. See “Playing the Game” for more 
information.
Immunities
This entry lists the monster’s Immunities, if any. If 
the monster has damage and condition Immunities, 
the damage types are listed before the conditions. 
See “Playing the Game” for details.
Gear
Monsters have proficiency with their equipment. If 
a monster has equipment that can be given away or 
retrieved, the items are listed in the Gear entry. The 
monster’s stat block might include special flour-
ishes that happen when the monster uses an item, 
and the stat block might ignore the rules in “Equip-
ment” for that item. When used by someone else, a 
retrievable item uses its “Equipment” rules, ignor-
ing any special flourishes in the stat block.
    The Gear entry doesn’t necessarily list all of a 
monster’s equipment. For example, a monster that 
wears clothes is assumed to be dressed appropri-
ately, and those clothes aren’t in this entry.
  Equipment mentioned outside the Gear entry is 
considered to be supernatural or highly specialized, 
and it is unusable when the monster is defeated.
Ammunition and Ranged Attacks
A monster that requires ammunition to make 
ranged attacks carries the necessary ammunition.
Equipping a Monster with Other Items
You may equip monsters with additional gear how-
ever you like, using the items in “Equipment” for 
inspiration. You decide how much of a monster’s 
equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain 
and whether any of that equipment is still usable.
    Beware of giving a monster combat-oriented 
magic items, since those might alter the monster’s 
Challenge Rating. If you do give a monster a magic 
item, the monster can have Attunement with magic 
items as noted in “Equipment.” A monster with 

253
System Reference Document 5.2
a class tag after its creature type is considered a 
member of that class for Attunement purposes.
Senses
The Senses entry specifies a monster’s Passive 
Perception score, as well as any special senses the 
monster possesses. Passive Perception and special 
senses are described in “Rules Glossary.”
Languages
This entry lists languages that the monster can use 
to communicate. Sometimes a monster can under-
stand a language but can’t communicate with it, 
which is noted in its entry. “None” indicates that a 
creature doesn’t comprehend any language.
Te l e p a t hy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature 
to communicate mentally with another creature 
within a specified range. See “Rules Glossary” for 
more information.
Challenge Rating
Challenge Rating is defined in “Rules Glossary,” 
while guidance on using CR to plan potential com-
bat encounters is in “Gameplay Toolbox.”
Experience Points
The number of Experience Points (XP) a monster 
is worth is based on its CR, as detailed in the Ex-
perience Points by Challenge Rating table. XP is 
awarded for defeating the monster in combat or 
otherwise neutralizing it.
    Unless a rule says otherwise, a monster sum-
moned by a spell or another magical ability is worth 
the XP noted in its stat block.

Proficiency Bonus
A monster’s Proficiency Bonus (PB) is determined 
by its CR, as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by 
Challenge Rating table, and is reflected in saving 
throws, skills, and other statistics where the mon-
ster’s exceptional aptitude is a factor.

Tr a i t s
A monster’s traits, if any, are features that are ac-
tive at all times or in certain situations.
Actions
A monster can take the actions in this section or 
take one of the actions available to all creatures, as 
described in “Playing the Game.”
Attack Notation
The entry for a monster’s attack identifies whether 
the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then 
provides the attack roll’s bonus, its reach or range, 
and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one 
target unless its entry says otherwise. For details 
on different kinds of attacks, see “Playing the Game” 
and “Spells.”
 Hit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur 
as a result of an attack hitting a target are described 
after the “Hit:” notation.
 Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a 
miss, that information follows the “Miss:” notation.
 Hit or Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs 
regardless of whether it hits or misses its target, 
that information follows the “Hit or Miss:” notation.
Saving Throw Effect Notation
If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect identi-
fies the kind of save required and then provides the 
save’s DC, a description of which creatures make 
the save, and an explanation of what happens on a 
failed or successful save.
    “Half damage only” on a successful save means 
the target takes half as much damage (round down) 
as targets that fail the save, while also ignoring all 
other parts of the effect.

254
System Reference Document 5.2
Damage Notation
A stat block usually provides both a number and a 
die expression for each instance of damage. For ex-
ample, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a 
hit. You decide whether to use the number or the die 
expression in parentheses; don’t use both.
Multiattack
Some creatures can make more than one attack 
when they take the Attack action. Such creatures 
have the Multiattack entry in the “Actions” section 
of their stat block. This entry details the attacks a 
creature can make, as well as any additional abili-
ties it can use, as part of the Attack action.
Spellcasting
If a monster can cast any spells, its stat block lists 
the spells and provides the monster’s spellcasting 
ability, spell save DC (if any spells require a saving 
throw), and spell attack bonus (if any spells require 
an attack roll). Unless noted otherwise, a spell of 
level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest possible 
level and can’t be cast at a higher level.
    A monster’s spell can have special rules or restric-
tions. For example, a green hag can cast the Invisi-
bility spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, 
which means the spell affects only the hag. 
 Spell Components. The Spellcasting trait notes 
whether the monster’s spellcasting ignores the 
need for certain spell components. If any spell com-
ponents are required, describe the monster’s use of 
Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal to 
characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that 
requires Material components has them.
 Casting Times of 1+ Minutes. If a spell has a cast-
ing time of 1 minute or more yet is listed in a spell-
casting action, the monster doesn’t cast the spell in 
just one action unless the action’s description states 
otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action 
on each of its turns and maintain Concentration to 
cast the spell, as described in “Rules Glossary.”
Bonus Action
If a monster has Bonus Action options, they are 
listed in this section. See “Playing the Game” for de-
tails on Bonus Actions.
Reactions
If the monster has Reaction options, those are listed 
in this section along with their triggers. See “Play-
ing the Game” for details on Reactions.
Legendary Actions
If the monster has Legendary Action options, those 
are listed in this section. A Legendary Action is an 
action that a monster can take immediately after 
another creature’s turn. Only one of these actions 
can be taken at a time and only after another crea-
ture’s turn ends. The monster can’t take a Legend-
ary Action if it has the Incapacitated condition or is 
otherwise unable to take actions.
    The monster has a limited number of Legendary 
Action uses, and that number is specified in the 
stat block. The monster expends one use whenever 
it takes a Legendary Action, and it regains all ex-
pended uses at the start of each of its turns.
Limited Usage
Some parts of a stat block have restrictions on the 
number of times they can be used. Here are the 
most common ways that usage is limited:
X/Day. This notation means the stat block part can 
be used a certain number of times (represented 
by X) and that a monster must finish a Long Rest 
to regain expended uses. For example, a Reaction 
that includes “1/Day” means the Reaction can be 
taken once and that the monster must finish a 
Long Rest to take it again.
Recharge X–Y. This notation means a monster 
can use the stat block part once. At the start of 
each of the monster’s turns, roll 1d6. If the roll 
is within the number range given in the notation 
(represented by X–Y), the monster regains the use 
of that part, which also recharges when the mon-
ster finishes a Short or Long Rest. For example, 
“Recharge 5–6” in an action means a monster can 
take the action once. Then, at the start of each of 
the monster’s turns, it regains the use of that ac-
tion if it rolls a 5 or 6 on 1d6.
Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This nota-
tion means the monster can use the stat block 
part once and must then finish a Short or Long 
Rest to use it again.

Amphibious. The aboleth can breathe air and water.
Eldritch Restoration. If destroyed, the aboleth gains 
a new body in 5d10 days, reviving with all its Hit 
Points in the Far Realm or another location chosen 
by the GM.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair). If 
the aboleth fails a saving throw, it can choose to suc-
ceed instead.
Mucus Cloud. While underwater, the aboleth is sur-
rounded by mucus. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 14, 
each creature in a 5-foot Emanation originating from 
the aboleth at the end of the aboleth’s turn. Failure: The 
target is cursed. Until the curse ends, the target’s skin 
becomes slimy, the target can breathe air and water, 
and it can’t regain Hit Points unless it is underwater. 
   While the cursed creature is outside a body of water, 
the creature takes 6 (1d12) Acid damage at the end of 
every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to its skin 
before those minutes have passed.
Probing Telepathy. If a creature the aboleth can see 
communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the abo-
leth learns the creature’s greatest desires.
Actions
Multiattack. The aboleth makes two Tentacle attacks 
and uses either Consume Memories or Dominate Mind 
if available.
Tentacle. Melee Attack Roll: +9, reach 15 ft. Hit: 12 
(2d6 + 5) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large 
or smaller creature, it has the Grappled condition (es-
cape DC 14) from one of four tentacles.
Consume Memories. Intelligence Saving Throw: DC 16, 
one creature within 30 feet that is Charmed or Grap-
pled by the aboleth. Failure: 10 (3d6) Psychic damage. 
Success: Half damage. Failure or Success: The aboleth 
gains the target’s memories if the target is a Humanoid 
and is reduced to 0 Hit Points by this action.
Dominate Mind (2/Day). Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 
16, one creature the aboleth can see within 30 feet. 
Failure: The target has the Charmed condition until 
the aboleth dies or is on a different plane of existence 
from the target. While Charmed, the target acts as an 
ally to the aboleth and is under its control while within 
60 feet of it. In addition, the aboleth and the target 
can communicate telepathically with each other over 
any distance. 
   The target repeats the save whenever it takes damage 
as well as after every 24 hours it spends at least 1 mile 
away from the aboleth, ending the effect on itself on 
a success.
Legendary Actions
Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after 
another creature’s turn, the aboleth can expend a use to 
take one of the following actions. The aboleth regains all 
expended uses at the start of each of its turns.
Lash. The aboleth makes one Tentacle attack.
Psychic Drain. If the aboleth has at least one creature 
Charmed or Grappled, it uses Consume Memories and 
regains 5 (1d10) Hit Points.

Crush. Melee Attack Roll: +5, reach 5 ft. Hit: 6 (1d6 
+ 3) Bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches 
to the target. If the target is a Medium or smaller crea-
ture and the darkmantle had Advantage on the attack 
roll, it covers the target, which has the Blinded condi-
tion and is suffocating while the darkmantle is attached 
in this way. 
   While attached to a target, the darkmantle can attack 
only the target but has Advantage on its attack rolls. Its 
Speed becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to its 
Speed, and it moves with the target. 
   A creature can take an action to try to detach the 
darkmantle from itself, doing so with a successful DC 
13 Strength (Athletics) check. On its turn, the darkman-
tle can detach itself by using 5 feet of movement.
Darkness Aura (1/Day). Magical Darkness fills a 15-foot 
Emanation originating from the darkmantle. This effect 
lasts while the darkmantle maintains Concentration 
on it, up to 10 minutes. Darkvision can’t penetrate this 
area, and no light can illuminate it.

jected to the following effect. Strength Saving Throw: 
DC 17 (a creature makes this save only once per turn, 
and the djinni is unaffected). Failure: While in the 
whirlwind, the target has the Restrained condition 
and moves with the whirlwind. At the start of each of 
its turns, the Restrained target takes 21 (6d6) Thunder

Aversion to Fire. If the golem takes Fire damage, it has 
Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the 
end of its next turn.
Berserk. Whenever the golem starts its turn Bloodied, 
roll 1d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of 
its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest 
creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to 
move to and attack, the golem attacks an object. Once 
the golem goes berserk, it remains so until it is de-
stroyed or it is no longer Bloodied. 
   The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk 
golem, can try to calm it by taking an action to make a 
DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check; the golem must be 
able to hear its creator. If this check succeeds, the go-
lem ceases being berserk until the start of its next turn, 
at which point it resumes rolling for the Berserk trait 
again if it is still Bloodied.
Immutable Form. The golem can’t shape-shift.
Lightning Absorption. Whenever the golem is sub-
jected to Lightning damage, it regains a number of Hit 
Points equal to the Lightning damage dealt.

Ooze Cube. The cube fills its entire space and is trans-
parent. Other creatures can enter that space, but a 
creature that does so is subjected to the cube’s Engulf 
and has Disadvantage on the saving throw. 
   Creatures inside the cube have Total Cover, and the 
cube can hold one Large creature or up to four Medium 
or Small creatures inside itself at a time. 
   As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the cube can 
pull a creature or an object out of the cube by suc-
ceeding on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, and the 
puller takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage.
Transparent. Even when the cube is in plain sight, a 
creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Percep-

nessed the cube move or otherwise act.
Actions
Pseudopod. Melee Attack Roll: +4, reach 5 ft. Hit: 12

Engulf. The cube moves up to its Speed without 
provoking Opportunity Attacks. The cube can move 
through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures if it has 
room inside itself to contain them (see the Ooze Cube 
trait). Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 12, each creature 
whose space the cube enters for the first time during 
this move. Failure: 10 (3d6) Acid damage, and the target 
is engulfed. An engulfed target is suffocating, can’t cast 
spells with a Verbal component, has the Restrained 
condition, and takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage at the start 
of each of the cube’s turns. When the cube moves, 
the engulfed target moves with it. An engulfed target 
can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 
12 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, 
the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied 
space. Success: Half damage, and the target moves to 
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cube. If there 
is no unoccupied space, the target fails the save instead.

has the Incapacitated condition and ignores the Luring 
Song of other harpies. If the target is more than 5 feet 
from the harpy, the target moves on its turn toward the 
harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 
feet of the harpy. It doesn’t avoid Opportunity Attacks; 
however, before moving into damaging terrain (such 
as lava or a pit) and whenever it takes damage from a 
source other than the harpy, the target repeats the save. 
Success: The target is immune to this harpy’s Luring 
Song for 24 hours.
