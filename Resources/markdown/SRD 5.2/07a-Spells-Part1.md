# Spells

## Gaining Spells

Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell prepared in your mind or have access to the spell from a magic item, such as a Spell Scroll. Your features specify which spells you have access to, if any; whether you always have certain spells prepared; and whether you can change the list of spells you have prepared.

### Preparing Spells

If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your spellcasting feature specifies when you can change the list and the number of spells you can change, as summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table.

**Spell Preparation by Class**

| Class | Change When You... | Number of Spells |
|:------|:-------------------|:-----------------|
| Bard | Gain a level | One |
| Cleric | Finish a Long Rest | Any |
| Druid | Finish a Long Rest | Any |
| Paladin | Finish a Long Rest | One |
| Ranger | Finish a Long Rest | One |
| Sorcerer | Gain a level | One |
| Warlock | Gain a level | One |
| Wizard | Finish a Long Rest | Any |

Most spellcasting monsters don't change their lists of prepared spells, but the GM is free to alter them.

### Always-Prepared Spells

Certain features might give you a spell that you always have prepared. If you also have a list of prepared spells that you can change, a spell that you always have prepared doesn't count against the number of spells on that list.

## Casting Spells

Each spell description has a series of entries that provide the details needed to cast the spell. The following sections explain each of those entries, which follow a spell's name.

### Spell Level

Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indicated in a spell's description. A spell's level is an indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips—simple spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class say when its members gain access to spells of certain levels.

### Spell Slots

Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster's magical potential is represented. Each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of spell slots of certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.

When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot with the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain size—small for a level 1 slot and larger for a higher-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that's at least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts Magic Missile, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of four level 1 slots and has three remaining.

Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell slots.

### Casting without Slots

There are several ways to cast a spell without expending a spell slot:

**Cantrips.** A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.

**Rituals.** Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it doesn't expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.

**Special Abilities.** Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day.

**Magic Items.** Spell Scrolls and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot. The description of such an item specifies how many times a spell can be cast from it.

### Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a Wizard casts Magic Missile using a level 2 slot, that Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as Magic Missile and Cure Wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.

### School of Magic

Each spell belongs to a school of magic. The schools are listed in the Schools of Magic table. These categories help describe spells but have no rules of their own, although some other rules refer to them.

**Schools of Magic**

| School | Typical Effects |
|:-------|:----------------|
| Abjuration | Prevents or reverses harmful effects |
| Conjuration | Transports creatures or objects |
| Divination | Reveals information |
| Enchantment | Influences minds |
| Evocation | Channels energy to create effects that are often destructive |
| Illusion | Deceives the mind or senses |
| Necromancy | Manipulates life and death |
| Transmutation | Transforms creatures or objects |

### Class Spell Lists

If a spell is on a class's spell list, the class's name appears in parentheses after the spell's school of magic. Some features add a spell to a character's spell list even if the character isn't a member of a class in the parentheses.

### Casting Time

Most spells require the Magic action to cast, but some spells require a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or 1 minute or more. A spell's Casting Time entry specifies which of those is required.

**One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn**

On a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast a spell. This rule means you can't, for example, cast a spell with a spell slot using the Magic action and another one using a Bonus Action on the same turn.

**Reaction and Bonus Action Triggers**

A spell that has a casting time of a Reaction is cast in response to a trigger that is defined in the spell's Casting Time entry. Some spells that have a casting time of a Bonus Action are also cast in response to a trigger defined in the spell.

**Longer Casting Times**

Certain spells—including a spell cast as a Ritual—require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 minute or more, you must take the Magic action on each of your turns, and you must maintain Concentration (see "Rules Glossary") while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. To cast the spell again, you must start over.

### Range

A spell's range indicates how far from the spellcaster the spell's effect can originate, and the spell's description specifies which part of the effect is limited by the range.

A range usually takes one of the following forms:

**Distance.** The range is expressed in feet.

**Touch.** The spell's effect originates on something, as defined by the spell, that the spellcaster must touch within their reach.

**Self.** The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates from them, as specified in the spell.

If a spell has movable effects, they aren't restricted by its range unless the spell's description says otherwise.

### Components

A spell's components are physical requirements the spellcaster must meet to cast the spell. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires Verbal (V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components. If the spellcaster can't provide one or more of a spell's components, the spellcaster can't cast the spell.

**Verbal (V)**

A Verbal component is the chanting of esoteric words that sound like nonsense to the uninitiated. The words must be uttered in a normal speaking voice. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is gagged or in an area of magical silence can't cast a spell with a Verbal component.

**Somatic (S)**

A Somatic component is a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must use at least one of their hands to perform these movements.

**Material (M)**

A Material component is a particular material used in a spell's casting, as specified in parentheses in the Components entry. These materials aren't consumed by the spell unless the spell's description states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand free to access them, but it can be the same hand used to perform Somatic components, if any.

If a spell doesn't consume its materials and doesn't specify a cost for them, a spellcaster can use a Component Pouch (see "Equipment") instead of providing the materials specified in the spell, or the spellcaster can substitute a Spellcasting Focus if the caster has a feature that allows that substitution. To use a Component Pouch, you must have a hand free to reach into it, and to use a Spellcasting Focus, you must hold it unless its description says otherwise (see "Equipment" for descriptions).

> **Identifying an Ongoing Spell**
> 
> You can try to identify a non-instantaneous spell by its observable effects if its duration is ongoing. To identify it, you must take the Study action and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

### Duration

A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of the following forms:

**Concentration.** A duration that requires Concentration follows the Concentration rules (see "Rules Glossary").

**Instantaneous.** An instantaneous duration means the spell's magic appears only for a moment and then disappears.

**Time Span.** A duration that provides a time span specifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, minutes, hours, or the like. For example, a Duration entry might say "1 minute," meaning the spell ends after 1 minute has passed. While a time-span spell that you cast is ongoing, you can dismiss it (no action required) if you don't have the Incapacitated condition.

### Effects

The effects of a spell are detailed after its duration entry. Those details present exactly what the spell does, which ignores mundane physical laws; any outcomes beyond those effects are under the GM's purview. Whatever the effects, they typically deal with targets, saving throws, attack rolls, or all three, each of which is detailed below.

**Targets**

A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description says whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or something else.

*A Clear Path to the Target.* To target something with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind Total Cover.

*Targeting Yourself.* If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature other than you.

*Areas of Effect.* Some spells, such as Thunderwave, cover an area called an area of effect, which is defined in "Rules Glossary." The area determines what the spell targets. The description of a spell specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Emanation, Line, or Sphere.

*Awareness of Being Targeted.* Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature doesn't know it was targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell's description says otherwise.

*Invalid Targets.* If you cast a spell on someone or something that can't be affected by it, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended.

If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.

**Saving Throws**

Many spells specify that a target makes a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure. Here's how to calculate the DC for your spells:

**Spell save DC = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus**

**Attack Rolls**

Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell hits a target. Here's how to calculate the attack modifier for your spells:

**Spell attack modifier = your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus**

### Combining Spell Effects

The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast Bless on the same target, that target gains the spell's benefit only once; the target doesn't receive two bonus dice. But if the durations of the spells overlap, the effect continues until the duration of the second Bless ends.

## Spell Descriptions

### Acid Arrow
**Level 2 Evocation** (Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 Acid damage and 2d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage only.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each spell slot level above 2.

### Acid Splash
**Evocation Cantrip** (Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create an acidic bubble at a point within range, where it explodes in a 5-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that Sphere must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 Acid damage.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6).

### Aid
**Level 2 Abjuration** (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a strip of white cloth)  
**Duration:** 8 hours

Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target's Hit Point maximum and current Hit Points increase by 5 for the duration.

**At Higher Levels.** Each target's Hit Points increase by 5 for each spell slot level above 2.

### Alarm
**Level 1 Abjuration** (Ranger, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)  
**Duration:** 8 hours

You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:

**Audible Alarm.** The alarm produces the sound of a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet of the warded area.

**Mental Alarm.** You are alerted by a mental ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you're asleep.

### Alter Self
**Level 2 Transmutation** (Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options. Its effects last for the duration, during which you can take a Magic action to replace the option you chose with a different one.

**Aquatic Adaptation.** You sprout gills and grow webs between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

**Change Appearance.** You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can take a Magic action to change your appearance in this way again.

**Natural Weapons.** You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to deal damage with that new growth, it deals 1d6 damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike, and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls rather than using Strength.

### Animal Friendship
**Level 1 Enchantment** (Bard, Druid, Ranger)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)  
**Duration:** 24 hours

Target a Beast that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. If you or one of your allies deals damage to the target, the spells ends.

**At Higher Levels.** You can target one additional Beast for each spell slot level above 1.

### Animal Messenger
**Level 2 Enchantment** (Bard, Druid, Ranger)

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)  
**Duration:** 24 hours

A Tiny Beast of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it attempts to deliver a message for you (if the target's Challenge Rating isn't 0, it automatically succeeds). You specify a location you have visited and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "a person dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat." You also communicate a message of up to twenty-five words. The Beast travels for the duration toward the specified location, covering about 25 miles per 24 hours or 50 miles if the Beast can fly.

When the Beast arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, mimicking your communication. If the Beast doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the Beast returns to where you cast the spell.

**At Higher Levels.** The spell's duration increases by 48 hours for each spell slot level above 2.

### Animal Shapes
**Level 8 Transmutation** (Druid)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 24 hours

Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. Each target shape-shifts into a Large or smaller Beast of your choice that has a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. You can choose a different form for each target. On later turns, you can take a Magic action to transform the targets again.

A target's game statistics are replaced by the chosen Beast's statistics, but the target retains its creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; alignment; ability to communicate; and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target's actions are limited by the Beast form's anatomy, and it can't cast spells. The target's equipment melds into the new form, and the target can't use any of that equipment while in that form.

The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the first form into which it shape-shifts. These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The transformation lasts for the duration or until the target ends it as a Bonus Action.

### Animate Dead
**Level 3 Necromancy** (Cleric, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid within range. The target becomes an Undead creature: a Skeleton if you chose bones or a Zombie if you chose a corpse (see "Monsters" for the stat blocks).

On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating a new creature.

**At Higher Levels.** You animate or reassert control over two additional Undead creatures for each spell slot level above 3. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

### Animate Objects
**Level 5 Transmutation** (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Objects animate at your command. Choose a number of nonmagical objects within range that aren't being worn or carried, aren't fixed to a surface, and aren't Gargantuan. The maximum number of objects is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; for this number, a Medium or smaller target counts as one object, a Large target counts as two, and a Huge target counts as three.

Each target animates, sprouts legs, and becomes a Construct that uses the Animated Object stat block; this creature is under your control until the spell ends or until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each creature you make with this spell is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count and takes its turn immediately after yours.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. When the creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it reverts to its object form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

**At Higher Levels.** The creature's Slam damage increases by 1d4 (Medium or smaller), 1d6 (Large), or 1d12 (Huge) for each spell slot level above 5.

#### Animated Object
*Huge or Smaller Construct, Unaligned*

**AC** 15  
**HP** 10 (Medium or smaller), 20 (Large), 40 (Huge)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 16 (+3) | 10 (+0) | 10 (+0) | 3 (−4) | 3 (−4) | 1 (−5) |

**Saving Throws** Str +3, Dex +0, Con +0, Int −4, Wis −4, Cha −5  
**Immunities** Poison, Psychic; Charmed, Exhaustion, Frightened, Paralyzed, Poisoned  
**Senses** Blindsight 30 ft.; Passive Perception 6  
**Languages** Understands the languages you know  
**CR** None (XP 0; PB equals your Proficiency Bonus)

***Actions***

**Slam.** *Melee Attack Roll:* Bonus equals your spell attack modifier, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* Force damage equal to 1d4 + 3 (Medium or smaller), 2d6 + 3 + your spellcasting ability modifier (Large), or 2d12 + 3 + your spellcasting ability modifier (Huge).

### Antilife Shell
**Level 5 Abjuration** (Druid)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

An aura extends from you in a 10-foot Emanation for the duration. The aura prevents creatures other than Constructs and Undead from passing or reaching through it. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with Ranged or Reach weapons through the barrier.

If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.

### Antimagic Field
**Level 8 Abjuration** (Cleric, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (iron filings)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

An aura of antimagic surrounds you in 10-foot Emanation. No one can cast spells, take Magic actions, or create other magical effects inside the aura, and those things can't target or otherwise affect anything inside it. Magical properties of magic items don't work inside the aura or on anything inside it.

Areas of effect created by spells or other magic can't extend into the aura, and no one can teleport into or out of it or use planar travel there. Portals close temporarily while in the aura.

Ongoing spells, except those cast by an Artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the area. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

Dispel Magic has no effect on the aura, and the auras created by different Antimagic Field spells don't nullify each other.

### Antipathy/Sympathy
**Level 8 Enchantment** (Bard, Druid, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a mix of vinegar and honey)  
**Duration:** 10 days

As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that save:

**Antipathy.** The creature has the Frightened condition. The Frightened creature must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from the target, moving by the safest route.

**Sympathy.** The creature has the Charmed condition. The Charmed creature must use its movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the target, moving by the safest route. If the creature is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can't willingly move away. If the target damages the Charmed creature, that creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

**Ending the Effect.** If the Frightened or Charmed creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.

### Arcane Eye
**Level 4 Divination** (Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an Invisible, invulnerable eye within range that hovers for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which can see in every direction. It also has Darkvision with a range of 30 feet.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

### Arcane Hand
**Level 5 Evocation** (Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (an eggshell and a glove)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a Large hand of shimmering magical energy in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and Hit Points equal to your Hit Point maximum. If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends. The hand doesn't occupy its space.

When you cast the spell and as a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects:

**Clenched Fist.** The hand strikes a target within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 Force damage.

**Forceful Hand.** The hand attempts to push a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target, remaining within 5 feet of it.

**Grasping Hand.** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or the target has the Grappled condition, with an escape DC equal to your spell save DC. While the hand grapples the target, you can take a Bonus Action to cause the hand to crush it, dealing Bludgeoning damage to the target equal to 4d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Interposing Hand.** The hand grants you Half Cover against attacks and other effects that originate from its space or that pass through it. In addition, its space counts as Difficult Terrain for your enemies.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage of the Clenched Fist increases by 2d8 and the damage of the Grasping Hand increases by 2d6 for each spell slot level above 5.

### Arcane Lock
**Level 2 Abjuration** (Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, container, or hatch and magically lock it for the duration. This lock can't be unlocked by any nonmagical means. You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open and close the object despite the lock. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, unlocks it for 1 minute.

### Arcane Sword
**Level 7 Evocation** (Bard, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature sword worth 250+ GP)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a spectral sword that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

On your later turns, you can take a Bonus Action to move the sword up to 30 feet to a spot you can see and repeat the attack against the same target or a different one.

### Arcanist's Magic Aura
**Level 2 Illusion** (Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)  
**Duration:** 24 hours

With a touch, you place an illusion on a willing creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried. A creature gains the Mask effect below, and an object gains the False Aura effect below. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast the spell on the same target every day for 30 days, the illusion lasts until dispelled.

**Mask (Creature).** Choose a creature type other than the target's actual type. Spells and other magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of the chosen type.

**False Aura (Object).** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect magical auras, such as Detect Magic. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, make a magic item appear nonmagical, or change the object's aura so that it appears to belong to a school of magic you choose.

### Astral Projection
**Level 9 Necromancy** (Cleric, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (for each of the spell's targets, one jacinth worth 1,000+ GP and one silver bar worth 100+ GP, all of which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already on that plane). Each target's body is left behind in a state of suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condition, doesn't need food or air, and doesn't age.

A target's astral form resembles its body in almost every way, replicating its game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view after 1 foot. If the cord is cut—which happens only when an effect states that it does so—the target's body and astral form both die.

A target's astral form can travel through the Astral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that plane, the target's body and possessions travel along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter its body on the new plane.

Any damage or other effects that apply to an astral form have no effect on the target's body and vice versa. If a target's body or astral form drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to dismiss it.

When the spell ends for a target who isn't dead, the target reappears in its body and exits the state of suspended animation.

You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses the omen from the Omens table.

**Omens**

| Omen | For Results That Will Be... |
|:-----|:----------------------------|
| Weal | Good |
| Woe | Bad |
| Weal and woe | Good and bad |
| Indifference | Neither good nor bad |

The spell doesn't account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change the results.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and your allies have Resistance to Necrotic damage, and your Hit Point maximums can't be reduced. If an ally with 0 Hit Points starts its turn in the aura, that ally regains 1 Hit Point.

The target must be either a Beast or Plant creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less or a natural plant that isn't a creature. The target gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a natural plant, it becomes a Plant creature and gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. The GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened Plant, such as the statistics for the Awakened Shrub or Awakened Tree in "Monsters."

The awakened target has the Charmed condition for 30 days or until you or your allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature chooses its attitude toward you.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (GM's choice) associated with its creature type.

- Choose one ability. The target has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.
- The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge action on that turn.

Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage, and it has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.

A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.
