# Magic Items

Magic Items
Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled 
monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such 
items grant capabilities a character could rarely 
have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s 
capabilities in wondrous ways.
Magic Item Categories
Every magic item belongs to a category. The Magic 
Item Categories table lists the nine categories and 
provides examples. Rules for the categories appear 
after the table.

Armor
An item in the Armor category is typically a magical 
version of armor from “Equipment.” Unless an ar-
mor’s description notes otherwise, the armor must 
be worn for its magic to function.
    Some suits of magic armor specify the type of ar-
mor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If 
no type is specified, choose the type or determine it 
randomly.
Potions
An item in the Potion category might be a magical 
brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be 
applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion 
consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.
 Using a Potion. Potions are consumable items. 
Drinking a potion or administering it to another 
creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil 
might take longer as specified in its description. 
Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it 
is used up.
 Mixing Potions. A character might drink one po-
tion while still under the effects of another or pour 
several potions into a single container. The strange 
ingredients used in creating potions can result in 
unpredictable interactions.
    When a character mixes two potions together, roll 
on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are 
combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, 
combining the results. Unless the effects are imme-
diately obvious, reveal them only when they become 
evident.
Potion Miscibility
1d100Result
01Both potions lose their effects, and the 
mixture creates a magical explosion in a 
5-foot-radius Sphere centered on itself. 
Each creature in that area takes 4d10 Force 
damage.
02–08Both potions lose their effects, and the mix-
ture becomes an ingested poison of your 
choice (see “Poison” in “Gameplay Toolbox”).
09 –15Both potions lose their effects.
16 –25One potion loses its effect.
26–35Both potions work, but with their numerical 
effects and durations halved. If a potion has 
no numerical effect and no duration, it instead 
loses its effect.
36–90Both potions work normally.
91–99Both potions work, but the numerical effects 
and duration of one potion are doubled. If nei-
ther potion has anything to double in this way, 
they work normally.
00Only one potion works, but its effects are 
permanent. Choose the simplest effect to 
make permanent or the one that seems the 
most fun. For example, a Potion of Healing 
might increase the drinker’s Hit Point maxi-
mum by 2d4 + 2, or a Potion of Invisibility might 
give the drinker the Invisible condition indefi-
nitely. At your discretion, a Dispel Magic spell 
or similar magic might end this lasting effect.
Rings
For its magic to function, an item in the Ring cate-
gory must be worn on a finger or a similar digit un-
less its description notes otherwise.
Rods
An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually 
made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs 
2 to 5 pounds.
    Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can 
be used as an Arcane Focus.

Magic iteM Rules
Rules for identifying, attuning to, and using magic 
items appear in “Equipment.” Additional rules are 
presented below.
 Attunement Prerequisites. If a magic item has 
a class prerequisite, a creature must be a member of 
that class to attune to the item. If a creature must be 
a spellcaster to attune to an item, the creature qual-
ifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or 
features, not by using a magic item or the like.
 Items Made for Specific Creatures. Magic 
items that are meant to be worn tend to magically 
adjust themselves to the wearer. However, you can 
decide that a magic item doesn’t adjust its size to fit 
any wearer. For example, a particular armorer might 
make items usable only by folk who are sized and 
shaped like dwarves. 
 Unusual Anatomy. Use your discretion to decide 
whether a creature can wear an item not made for 
its anatomy. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, 
but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t 
wear magic boots.
 Paired Items. You can allow exceptions to the 
rule that paired items must both be worn. For ex-
ample, a character with only one arm might be able 
to use a single Glove of Missile Snaring so long as the 
matching glove is on their person.
Scrolls
An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or 
parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods 
and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, 
leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is 
the Spell Scroll, a spell stored in written form.
 Using a Scroll. Scrolls are consumable items. Un-
leashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to 
read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, 
the scroll can’t be used again. Its words fade, or it 
crumbles into dust.
    Any creature that can understand a written lan-
guage can read a scroll and attempt to activate it 
unless its description notes otherwise.
Staffs
Items in the Staff category vary widely in appear-
ance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout 
and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some 
are made of wood, and others are composed of pol-
ished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and 
7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane.
    Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can 
be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane 
Focus.
Wands
An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15 
inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It 
is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other 
material.
    Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand 
can be used as an Arcane Focus.
Weapons
A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a 
weapon from “Equipment.” Some magic weapons 
specify the type of weapon they are in their de-
scriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no 
weapon type is specified, you may choose the type 
or determine it randomly.
 Ammunition. If a magic weapon has the Ammu-
nition property, ammunition fired from it is consid-
ered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares 
whether a weapon is magical or not.
Wondrous Items
Wondrous Items include wearable items such 
as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and 
circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical 
instruments, and more also fall into this category.
Magic Item Rarity
Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a 
rough measure of an item’s power relative to other 
magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic 
Item Rarities and Values table.
    Common magic items, such as a Potion of Healing, 
are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the Dragon 
Orb, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire.
Magic Item Values by Rarity
Common magic items can often be bought in a 
town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are 
usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items 
might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as a 
city on another plane of existence. If you allow char-
acters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign, 
rarity can help you set prices for those items. Gold 
Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities 
and Values table, though a seller might ask for a ser-
vice rather than coin as payment.
    If a magic item incorporates an item that has a 
purchase cost in “Equipment” (such as a weapon or 
a suit of armor), add that item’s cost to the magic 
item’s value. For example, +1   A r m or (Plate Armor) 

System Reference Document 5.2

has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare 
magic item’s value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate 
Armor (1,500 GP).

*Halve the value for a consumable item other than a Spell Scroll. 
The value of a Spell Scroll is double what it costs to scribe the scroll 
(as specified in the “Scribing Spell Scrolls” section of “Equipment”).
Activating a Magic Item
It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic 
item. The item’s user might also need to do some-
thing special. The description of each item category 
or individual item details how an item is activated. 
Certain items use the following rules for their 
activation.
Command Word
A command word is a word or short phrase that 
must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spo-
ken command words must be audible and fail to 
work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in 
the area of the Silence spell.
Consumable Items
Some items are consumed—used up, in other 
words—when they are activated. A Potion of Healing 
must be swallowed, for example, while the writing 
vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a 
consumable item loses its magic.
Spells Cast from Items
Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from 
the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible 
spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the us-
er’s spell slots, and requires no components unless 
the item’s description notes otherwise. The spell 
uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, 
and the user of the item must concentrate if the 
spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as 
Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the 
spell’s effects with its usual duration. Certain items 
make exceptions to these rules, changing the cast-
ing time, duration, or other parts of a spell.
    A magic item may require the user to use their 
own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from 
the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting 
ability, the user chooses which one to use with the 
item. If the user doesn’t have a spellcasting ability, 
their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, 
and the user’s Proficiency Bonus applies.
Charges
Some magic items have charges that must be ex-
pended to activate their properties. The number 
of charges an item has remaining is revealed when 
the Identify spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to 
an item knows how many charges the item has and 
how many it regains.
“The Next Dawn”
Magic items often have charges or properties that 
recharge at the next dawn or some other specified 
time. If such an item is on a world or plane of exis-
tence where the specified event doesn’t occur, the 
GM determines when the item recharges.
Cursed Items
A magic item’s description specifies whether it 
bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, in-
cluding the Identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse.
    Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended volun-
tarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a 
Remove Curse spell.
Magic Item Resilience
A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical 
item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Po-
tions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage.
    An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special 
way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learn-
ing how to destroy an Artifact usually requires 
research or the completion of a quest.
Crafting Magic Items
“Equipment” contains rules on brewing Potions of 
Healing and scribing Spell Scrolls. To create other 
magic items, follow the rules below. In these rules, 
“you” refers to the character crafting the magic 
item.
Arcana Proficiency
To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must 
have proficiency in the Arcana skill.
To o l s
The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool is re-
quired to make a magic item of each category. You 
must use the required tool to make an item and 
have proficiency with that tool. Any assistants must 
also have proficiency with it. For more information 
on the tools, see “Equipment.”

Spells
If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells 
from it, you must have all those spells prepared ev-
ery day you spend crafting the item.
Time and Cost
Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and 
money based on the item’s rarity as shown in the 
Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table.
 Work per Day. For each day of crafting, you must 
work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days, 
those days needn’t be consecutive.
 Assistants. Characters can combine their efforts 
to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed 
to create an item by the number of characters work-
ing on it. Normally, only one other character can 
assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.
 Raw Materials. The cost in the table represents 
the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The 
GM determines whether appropriate raw materials 
are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance 
that the materials are available, and in any other 
settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials 
aren’t available, you must wait at least 7 days before 
checking on the availability again.
    If a magic item incorporates an item that has a 
purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), 
you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item 
using the rules in “Equipment.” For example, to 
make +1   A r m or (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500 
GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the armor.

*The time and cost are halved for a consumable item other than 
a Spell Scroll, whose crafting time and cost are given in “Equipment.”
Sentient Magic Items
Some magic items have sentience and personality. 
Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the 
spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to 
the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be 
a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in 
the side.
    Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds 
of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items 
such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.
    The GM controls sentient magic items and their 
activated properties. A bearer who maintains a 
good relationship with the item can access those 
properties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict 
can ensue (see “Conflict” below).
Sentient Magic Item Traits
When you make a sentient magic item, you create 
the item’s persona much as you would create an 
NPC, with these exceptions.
Abilities
A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and 
Charisma scores. Choose the item’s abilities, or de-
termine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6 for each 
one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.
Alignment
A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator 
or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise, 
pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient Item’s 
Alignment table.
Communication
A sentient item communicates by sharing its emo-
tions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or 
speaking aloud. You can choose how it communi-
cates or roll on the Sentient Item’s Communication 
table.
Senses
A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to 
a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on 
the Sentient Item’s Senses table.

System Reference Document 5.2
208
Special Purpose
You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, 
perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the 
wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special 
purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating 
from this course might cause conflict between the 
wielder and the item (see “Conflict” below). You can 
pick a special purpose or roll on the Sentient Item’s 
Special Purpose table.

1
Aligned. The item seeks to defeat or destroy 
those of a diametrically opposed alignment. 
Such an item is never Neutral.
2
Bane. The item seeks to thwart or destroy 
creatures of a particular type, such as Con-
structs, Fiends, or Undead.
3
Creator Seeker. The item seeks its creator 
and wants to understand why it was created.
4
Destiny Seeker. The item believes it and its 
bearer have key roles to play in future events.
1d10Special Purpose
5
Destroyer. The item craves destruction and 
goads its user to fight arbitrarily.
6
Glory Seeker. The item seeks renown as the 
greatest magic item in the world by winning 
fame or notoriety for its user.
7
Lore Seeker. The item craves knowledge or is 
determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, 
or unravel a cryptic prophecy.
8
Protector. The item seeks to defend a par-
ticular kind of creature, such as elves or 
werewolves.
9
Soulmate Seeker. The item seeks another 
sentient magic item, perhaps one that is similar 
to itself.
10
Templar. The item seeks to defend the ser-
vants and interests of a particular deity.
Conflict
When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner 
opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict 
can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item’s 
bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus 
the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the 
item makes one or more of the following demands:
Chase My Dreams. The item demands that its 
bearer pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of 
all other goals.
Get Rid of It. The item demands that its bearer dis-
pose of anything the item finds repugnant.
It’s Time for a Change. The item demands to be 
given to someone else.
Keep Me Close. The item insists on being carried or 
worn at all times.
If its bearer refuses to comply with the item’s de-
mands, the item can do any of the following:
• Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it.
• Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
• Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon 
the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 
12 plus the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed 
save, the bearer has the Charmed condition for 
1d12 hours. While Charmed in this way, the 
bearer must try to follow the item’s commands. 
If the bearer takes damage, it repeats the save, 
ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the 
attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item 
can’t use this power again until the next dawn.

Magic Items A–Z
Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. 
    If a magic item description capitalizes a creature’s 
name and presents it in bold type, that’s a visual 
cue pointing you to the creature’s stat block. Unless 
the text states otherwise, the stat block is in “Mon-
sters.” How to read and use a stat block is explained 
in “Monsters.”
Adamantine Armor
Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor), 
Uncommon
This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, 
one of the hardest substances in existence. While 
you’re wearing it, any Critical Hit against you be-
comes a normal hit.
Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3
Weapon (Any Ammunition), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2), 
or Very Rare (+3) 
You have a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bo-
nus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. 
Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer 
magical.
    This ammunition is typically found or sold in 
quantities of ten or twenty pieces. Ten pieces of this 
ammunition are equivalent in value to a potion of 
the same rarity.
Ammunition of Slaying
Weapon (Any Ammunition), Very Rare 
This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures 
of a particular type, which the GM chooses or de-
termines randomly by rolling on the table below. If 
a creature of that type takes damage from the am-
munition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution 
saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage 
on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a 
successful one.
    After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the 
ammunition becomes nonmagical.

the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if 
you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The 
Shield remains animate for 1 minute, until you take 
a Bonus Action to end this effect, or until you die or 
have the Incapacitated condition, at which point the 
Shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you 
have one free.

Apparatus of the Crab
Wondrous Item, Legendary 
This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel 
weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden 
catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the 
catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, al-
lowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl 
inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, 
each in a neutral position, able to move up or down. 
When certain levers are used, the apparatus trans-
forms to resemble a giant lobster.
    The    Apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with 
the following statistics: AC 20; HP 200; Speed 30 
ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs aren’t ex-
tended); Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.
    To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires 
one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the 
compartment is airtight and watertight. The com-
partment holds enough air for 10 hours of breath-
ing, divided by the number of breathing creatures 
inside.
  The apparatus floats on water. It can also go 
underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the 
vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute 
from pressure.
    A creature in the compartment can take a Utilize 
action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s 
levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back 
to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, 
functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab 
Levers table.
Armor, +1, +2, or +3
Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Rare (+1), Very

Armor of Vulnerability
Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Rare (Requires 
Attunement)
While wearing this armor, you have Resistance to 
one of the following damage types: Bludgeoning, 
Piercing, or Slashing. The GM chooses the type or 
determines it randomly.
 Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed 
only when the Identify spell is cast on the armor or 
you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you 
until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or 
similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the 
curse. While cursed, you have Vulnerability to two 
of the three damage types associated with the ar-
mor (not the one to which it grants Resistance).
Arrow-Catching Shield
Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)
You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class against ranged 
attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus 
is in addition to the Shield’s normal bonus to AC.
    Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll 
against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a 
Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
Bag of Beans
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when 
found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of 
how many beans it contains and becomes a non-
magical item when it no longer contains any beans.
    If you dump one or more beans out of the bag, 
they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on 
them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the ex-
plosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including 
you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much 
damage on a successful one.
    If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt 
or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it 
produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground 
where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect 
from the following table or determine it randomly.
1d100Effect
015d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a 
toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the 
eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or take 5d6 Poison damage and 
have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On 
an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 Temporary 
Hit Points for 1 hour.
02–10A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, 
mayonnaise, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s 
choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d4 minutes.
1d100Effect
11 – 2 0
A Tre a n t sprouts. Roll any die. On an odd 
roll, the treant is Chaotic Evil. On an even 
roll, the treant is Chaotic Good. 
21–30An animate but immobile stone statue in 
your likeness rises and makes verbal threats 
against you. If you leave it and others come 
near, it describes you as the most heinous 
of villains and directs the newcomers to find 
and attack you. If you are on the same plane 
of existence as the statue, it knows where 
you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 
24 hours.
31– 40A campfire with green flames springs 
forth and burns for 24 hours or until it is 
extinguished.
41–50
Three Shrieker Fungi sprout.
51– 601d4 + 4 bright-pink toads crawl forth. When-
ever a toad is touched, it transforms into a 
Large or smaller monster of the GM’s choice 
that acts in accordance with its alignment 
and nature. The monster remains for 1 min-
ute, then disappears in a puff of bright-pink 
smoke.
61–70
A hungry Bulette burrows up and attacks.
71– 8 0A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 
of which act as randomly determined po-
tions. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked 
fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.
81–90A nest of 1d4 + 3 rainbow-colored eggs 
springs up. Any creature that eats an egg 
makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. 
On a successful save, a creature permanently 
increases its lowest ability score by 1, ran-
domly choosing among equally low scores. 
On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 
Force damage from an internal explosion.
91–95A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts 
upward. Inside is a burial chamber containing 
a Mummy, a Mummy Lord, or some other 
Undead of the GM’s choice. Its sarcophagus 
contains treasure of the GM’s choice.
96–00A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a 
height of the GM’s choice. The top leads 
where the GM chooses, such as to a great 
view, a cloud giant’s castle, or another plane 
of existence.

Bag of Devouring
Wondrous Item, Very Rare 
This bag resembles a Bag of Holding but is a feeding 
orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. 
Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.
    The extradimensional creature attached to the 
bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. 
Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the 
bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a liv-
ing creature is placed in the bag, as happens when 
someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent 
chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A 
creature inside the bag can take an action to try to 
escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength 
(Athletics) check. Another creature can take an ac-
tion to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, do-
ing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) 
check, provided the puller isn’t pulled inside the bag 
first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag 
is devoured, its body destroyed.
    Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which 
can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, 
once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside 
it and spits them out into another plane of existence. 
The GM determines the time and plane.
    If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and 
anything contained within it is transported to a 
random location on the Astral Plane.
Bag of Holding
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This bag has an interior space considerably larger 
than its outside dimensions—roughly 2 feet square 
and 4 feet deep on the inside. The bag can hold up 
to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic 
feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its 
contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires 
a Utilize action.
    If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is de-
stroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral 
Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents 
spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right 
before it can be used again. The bag holds enough 
air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the num-
ber of breathing creatures inside.
    Placing a Bag of Holding inside an extradimen-
sional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable 
Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items 
and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate orig-
inates where the one item was placed inside the 
other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere 
centered on the gate is sucked through it to a ran-
dom location on the Astral Plane. The gate then 
closes. The gate is one-way and can’t be reopened.
Bag of Tricks
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This bag made from gray, rust, or tan cloth appears 
empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals 
the presence of a small, fuzzy object.
    You can take a Magic action to pull the fuzzy ob-
ject from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When 
the object lands, it transforms into a creature you 
determine by rolling on the table that corresponds 
to the bag’s color. See “Monsters” for the creature’s 
stat block. The creature vanishes at the next dawn 
or when it is reduced to 0 Hit Points.
    The creature is Friendly to you and your allies, 
and it acts immediately after you on your Initiative 
count. You can take a Bonus Action to command 
how the creature moves and what action it takes on 
its next turn, such as attacking an enemy. In the ab-
sence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion 
appropriate to its nature.
    Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from 
the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next 
dawn.

Bead of Force
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in 
diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 
Beads of Force are found together.
    You can take a Magic action to throw the bead up 
to 60 feet. The bead explodes in a 10-foot-radius 
Sphere on impact and is destroyed. Each creature 

System Reference Document 5.2
213
in the Sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or take 5d4 Force damage. A sphere 
of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 
minute. Any creature that failed the save and is 
completely within the area is trapped inside this 
sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are 
partially within the area are pushed away from the 
center of the sphere until they are no longer inside 
it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s 
wall. No attack or other effect can pass through.
    An enclosed creature can take a Utilize action to 
push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere 
up to half the creature’s Speed. The sphere can be 
picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 
pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.
Belt of Dwarvenkind
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this belt, you gain the following 
benefits:
Dwarvish. You know Dwarvish.

lowing additional benefits while wearing the belt:

made with this magic weapon. In addition, while 
you are attuned to this weapon, your Hit Point 
maximum increases by 1 for each level you have 
attained.
 Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming at-
tuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you 
remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the 
weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. You 
also have Disadvantage on attack rolls with weap-
ons other than this one.
    Whenever another creature damages you while 
the weapon is in your possession, you must succeed 
on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. This 
berserk state ends when you start your turn and 
there are no creatures within 60 feet of you that you 
can see or hear.
    While berserk, you regard the creature nearest 
to you that you can see or hear as your enemy. If 
there are multiple possible creatures, choose one at 
random. On each of your turns, you must move as 
close to the creature as possible and take the Attack 
action, targeting the creature. If you’re unable to 
get close enough to the creature to attack it with 
the weapon, your turn ends after you’ve used up all 
your available movement. If the creature dies or can 
no longer be seen or heard by you, the next nearest 
creature that you can see or hear becomes your 
new target.

together again, you end the effect.
    When you’ve used the boots’ property for a total 
of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you 
until you finish a Long Rest.

The broom stops hovering when you land or when 
you’re no longer riding it.
    As a Magic action, you can send the broom to 
travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if

broom comes back to you when you take a Magic 
action and use a command word if the broom is still 
within 1 mile of you.
Candle of Invocation
Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
This candle’s magic is activated when the candle 
is lit, which requires a Magic action. After burning 
for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff 
it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time 
it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total 
burn time.

radius. While you are within that light, you have 
Advantage on D20 Tests. In addition, a Cleric or 
Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have 
prepared without expending spell slots.
    Alternatively, when you light the candle for the

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.
    You can take a Magic action to remove the stopper

One creature of your choice in the Line must suc-
ceed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 
1d4 Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone con-
dition. Instead of a creature, you can target one 
object in the Line that isn’t being worn or carried 
and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The 
object is knocked over by the geyser.
Deck of Illusions
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34 
cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with 
a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usu-
ally missing 1d20 − 1 cards.
    The magic of the deck functions only if its cards 
are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action 
to draw a card at random from the deck and throw 
it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. 
An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on 
the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown 
card and remains until dispelled. The illusory crea-
ture created by the card looks and behaves like a 
real creature of its kind, except that it can do no 
harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory 
creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action 
to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.
    Any physical interaction with the illusory crea-
ture reveals it to be false, because objects pass 
through it. A creature that takes a Study action to 
visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as 
an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card 
is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel 
Magic spell or a similar effect). When the illusion 
ends, the image on its card disappears, and that 
card can’t be used again.

Defender
Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Legendary (Requires 
Attunement)
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon.

System Reference Document 5.2
218
  The first time you attack with the weapon on each 
of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the 
weapon’s bonus to your Armor Class. For example, 
you could reduce the bonus to your attack rolls and 
damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to Armor 
Class. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until 
the start of your next turn, although you must hold 
the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it.
Demon Armor
Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Very Rare 
(Requires Attunement)
While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to 
Armor Class, and you know Abyssal. In addition, 
the armor’s clawed gauntlets allow your Unarmed 
Strikes to deal 1d8 Slashing damage instead of the 
usual Bludgeoning damage, and you gain a +1 bonus 
to the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed 
Strikes.
 Curse. Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t 
doff it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse 
spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, 
you have Disadvantage on attack rolls against de-
mons and on saving throws against their spells and 
special abilities.
Dimensional Shackles
Wondrous Item, Rare 
You can take a Utilize action to place these shackles 
on a creature that has the Incapacitated condition. 
The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to 
Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound 
by them from using any method of extradimen-
sional movement, including teleportation or travel 
to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent 
the creature from passing through an interdimen-
sional portal.
    You and any creature you designate when you 
use the shackles can take a Utilize action to remove 
them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can 
make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a suc-
cessful check, the creature breaks free and destroys 
the shackles.
Dragon Orb
Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)
An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in 
diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in 
diameter, and mist swirls inside it.
    While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic 
action to peer into the orb’s depths. You must then 
make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a success-
ful save, you control the orb for as long as you re-
main attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes 
the Charmed condition on you for as long as you 
remain attuned to it.
    While you are Charmed by the orb, you can’t 
voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb 
casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging 
you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The 
dragon essence within the orb might want many 
things: the annihilation of a particular society or or-
ganization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffer-
ing in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, 
or something else the GM decides.
 Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 
expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the 
orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following 
table from it. The table indicates how many charges 
you must expend to cast the spell.

 Call Dragons. While you control the orb, you 
can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a 
telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 
miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled 
to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most 
direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are un-
affected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to 
the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling 
them against their will. Once you have used this 
property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.
 Destroying an Orb. A Dragon Orb has AC 20 and is 
destroyed if it takes damage from a +3 Weapon or a 
Disintegrate spell. Nothing else can harm it.
Dragon Scale Mail
Armor (Scale Mail), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
Dragon Scale Mail is made of the scales of one kind 
of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off 
scales and gift them. Other times, hunters carefully 
preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, 
Dragon Scale Mail is highly valued.
    While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to 
Armor Class, you have Advantage on saving throws 
against the breath weapons of Dragons, and you 
have Resistance to one damage type determined by 
the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the 
accompanying table).
    Additionally, you can focus your senses as a Magic 
action to discern the distance and direction to the 
closest dragon within 30 miles of yourself that is 
of the same type as the armor. This action can’t be 
used again until the next dawn.

Dragon Slayer
Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Rare 
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon.
    The weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage of the 
weapon’s type if the target is a Dragon.
Dust of Disappearance
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This powder resembles fine sand. There is enough 
of it for one use. When you take a Utilize action to 
throw the dust into the air, you and each creature 
and object within a 10-foot Emanation originating 
from you have the Invisible condition for 2d4 min-
utes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and 
the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. 
Immediately after an affected creature makes an at-
tack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell, the Invisible 
condition ends for that creature.
Dust of Dryness
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. 
As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the 
dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot Cube of 
water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats 
or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The 
pellet’s weight is negligible. A creature can take 
a Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard 
surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the 
water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pel-
let and ends its magic.
    As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the 
dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that 
is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Ele-
mental). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the 
dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, tak-
ing 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as 
much damage on a successful one.
Dust of Sneezing and Choking
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
Found in a small container, this powder resembles 
Dust of Disappearance, and Identify reveals it to be 
such. There is enough of it for one use.
    As a Utilize action, you can throw the dust into the 
air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot 
Emanation originating from you to make a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals, 
Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save 
automatically.
    On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing un-
controllably; it has the Incapacitated condition and 
is suffocating. The creature repeats the save at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on 
a success. The effect also ends on any creature tar-
geted by a Lesser Restoration spell.
Dwarven Plate
Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Very Rare 
While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to 
Armor Class. In addition, if an effect moves you 
against your will along the ground, you can take a 
Reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by 
up to 10 feet.
Dwarven Thrower
Weapon (Warhammer), Very Rare (Requires 
Attunement by a Dwarf or a Creature Attuned to a Belt 
of Dwarvenkind)
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. It has the Thrown 
property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long 
range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack 
using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force dam-
age, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is 
a Giant. Immediately after hitting or missing, the 
weapon flies back to your hand.
Efficient Quiver
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects 
to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver 
to hold numerous items while never weighing more 
than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold 
up to 60 Arrows, Bolts, or similar objects. The mid-
size compartment holds up to 18 Javelins or similar 
objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long 
objects, such as bows, Quarterstaffs, or Spears.
    You can draw any item the quiver contains as if 
doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
Efreeti Bottle
Wondrous Item, Very Rare 
When you take a Magic action to remove the stop-
per of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick 
smoke flows out of it. At the end of your turn, the 
smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and 
an Efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 
30 feet of you.
  The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls on 
the following table to determine what happens.

System Reference Document 5.2
220
1d10Effect
1The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 
rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle 
loses its magic.
2–9The efreeti understands your languages and 
obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which 
it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper 
contains it. The stopper can’t be removed for 
24 hours. The next two times the bottle is 
opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is 
opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and 
disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.
10The efreeti understands your languages and can 
cast Wish once for you. It disappears when it 
grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle 
loses its magic.
Elemental Gem
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. 
When you take a Utilize action to break the gem, 
an elemental is summoned (see “Monsters” for its 
stat block), and the gem ceases to be magical. The 
elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close 
to the broken gem as possible, understands your 
languages, obeys your commands, and takes its 
turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. 
The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, 
or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The type 
of gem determines the elemental, as shown in the 
following table.
GemSummoned Elemental

Elven Chain
Armor (Chain Mail or Chain Shirt), Rare 
You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class while you wear 
this armor. You are considered trained with this ar-
mor even if you lack training with Medium or Heavy 
armor.
Eversmoking Bottle
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
As a Magic action, you can open or close this bottle.
    Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow 
out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot Emanation 
originating from the bottle. The area within the 
smoke is Heavily Obscured.
    Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of 
the Emanation increases by 10 feet until it reaches 
its maximum size of 120 feet. 
    Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become 
fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes. 
A strong wind (such as that created by the Gust of 
Wind spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.
Eyes of Charming
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 
3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 
1 or more charges to cast Charm Person (save DC 
13). For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the 
spell. You increase the spell’s level by one for each 
additional charge you expend. The lenses regain all 
expended charges daily at dawn.
Eyes of Minute Seeing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wear-
ing them, your vision improves significantly out to a 
range of 1 foot, granting you Darkvision within that 
range and Advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) 
checks made to examine something within that 
range.
Eyes of the Eagle
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wear-
ing them, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of 
clear visibility, you can make out details of even 
extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 
2 feet across.
Feather Token
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies 
This object looks like a feather. Different types of 
feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use 
effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or deter-
mines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens 
table. The type of token determines its rarity. 
 Anchor (Uncommon). You can take a Magic action 
to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 
24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means. 
Touching the token to the vessel again ends the ef-
fect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.
 Bird (Rare). You can take a Magic action to toss 
the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears 
and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. 
The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can’t at-
tack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry 
up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum 
speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 
miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of 
flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird 
disappears after flying its maximum distance for a 
day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the 
bird as a Magic action.

System Reference Document 5.2
221
 Fan (Uncommon). If you are on a boat or ship, 
you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 
10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant 
flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and cre-
ates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one 
ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 
hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.
 Swan Boat (Rare). You can take a Magic action to 
touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet 
in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-
long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its 
place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across 
water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take 
a Magic action while on the boat to command it to 
move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains 
for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss 
the boat as a Magic action.
 Tree (Uncommon). You must be outdoors to use 
this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it 
to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token 
disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree 
springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and 
has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the 
top spread out in a 20-foot radius.
 W hip (Rare). You can take a Magic action to 
throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. 
The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its 
place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a 
melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet 
of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the 
target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.
    As a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to 
fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a 
creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip dis-
appears after 1 hour, when you take a Magic action 
to dismiss it, or when you die or have the Incapaci-
tated condition.

Figurine of Wondrous Power
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies 
A Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small 
enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic ac-
tion to throw the figurine to a point on the ground 
within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a 
living creature specified in the figurine’s descrip-
tion below. If the space where the creature would 
appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or 
if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figu-
rine doesn’t become a creature.
    The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. 
It understands your languages, obeys your com-
mands, and takes its turn immediately after you on 
your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the 
creature defends itself but takes no other actions.
  The creature exists for a duration specific to each 
figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature 
reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine 
early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if 
you take a Magic action while touching the creature 
to make it revert to figurine form. When the crea-
ture becomes a figurine again, its property can’t 
be used again until a certain amount of time has 
passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.
 Bronze Griffon (Rare). This bronze statuette is of 
a griffon rampant. It can become a Griffon for up to 
6 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again 
until 5 days have passed.
 Ebony Fly (Rare). This ebony statuette, carved in 
the likeness of a horsefly, can become a Giant Fly 
(see the accompanying stat block) for up to 12 hours 
and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, 
it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed.

 Golden Lions (Rare). These gold statuettes of 
lions are always created in pairs. You can use one 
figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become 
a Lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it 
can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.
 Ivory Goats (Rare). These ivory statuettes of 
goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat 
looks unique and functions differently from the oth-
ers. Their properties are as follows:
Goat of Terror. This figurine can become a Giant 
Goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but 
you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use 
them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 Lance, 
and the other becomes a +2 Longsword. Removing 
a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons 
disappear and the horns return when the goat 
reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, 

System Reference Document 5.2
222
any Hostile creature that starts its turn within 
a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat 
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or 
have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until 
you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat 
reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature 
repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it 
succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to 
this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine 
has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days 
have passed.
Goat of Traveling. This figurine can become a 
Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding 
Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or por-
tion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. 
While it has charges, you can use it as often as you 
wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a 
figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have 
passed, when it regains all expended charges.
Goat of Travail. This figurine can become a Giant 
Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it 
can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.
 Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette 
resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an 
Elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, 
it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.
 Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished ob-
sidian horse can become a Nightmare for up to 24 
hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. 
Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 
days have passed.
  The figurine has a 10 percent chance each time 
you use it to ignore your orders, including a com-
mand to revert to figurine form. If you mount the 
nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you 
and the nightmare are instantly transported to a 
random location on the plane of Hades, where the 
nightmare reverts to figurine form.
 Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can 
become a Mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has 
an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also 
has Blindsight with a range of 60 feet. Once it has 
been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have 
passed.
 Serpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette 
of an owl can become a Giant Owl for up to 8 hours. 
The owl can communicate telepathically with you at 
any range if you and it are on the same plane of ex-
istence. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again 
until 2 days have passed.
 Silver Raven (Uncommon). This silver statuette 
of a raven can become a Raven for up to 12 hours. 
Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 2 
days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine 
grants you the ability to cast Animal Messenger on it.
Flame Tongue
Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Rare (Requires 
Attunement)
While holding this magic weapon, you can take a 
Bonus Action and use a command word to cause 
flames to engulf the damage-dealing part of the 
weapon. These flames shed Bright Light in a 40-
foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet. 
While the weapon is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 
Fire damage on a hit. The flames last until you take 
a Bonus Action to issue the command again or until 
you drop, stow, or sheathe the weapon.
Folding Boat
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This object appears as a wooden box that measures 
12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. 
It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to 
store items inside. This item also has three com-
mand words, each requiring a Magic action to use:
First Command Word. The box unfolds into a 
Rowboat.
Second Command Word. The box unfolds into a 
Keelboat.
Third Command Word. The Folding Boat folds back 
into a box if no creatures are aboard. Any objects 
in the vessel that can’t fit inside the box remain 
outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the ves-
sel that can fit inside the box do so.
When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes 
that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that 
was stored in the box remains in the boat.
    Statistics for the Rowboat and Keelboat appear 
in “Equipment.” If either vessel is reduced to 0 Hit 
Points, the Folding Boat is destroyed.
Frost Brand
Weapon (Glaive, Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, 
Scimitar, or Shortsword), Very Rare (Requires 
Attunement)
When you hit with an attack roll using this magic 
weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 Cold damage. 
In addition, while you hold the weapon, you have 
Resistance to Fire damage.
    In freezing temperatures, the weapon sheds 
Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an 
additional 10 feet.
    When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish 
all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of yourself. 
Once used, this property can’t be used again for 
1 hour.

Gauntlets of Ogre Power
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
Your Strength is 19 while you wear these gauntlets. 
They have no effect on you if your Strength is 19 or 
higher without them.
Gem of Brightness
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding 
it, you can take a Magic action and use one of three 
command words to cause one of the following 
effects:
First Command Word. The gem sheds Bright Light 
in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 
30 feet. This effect doesn’t expend a charge. It 
lasts until you take a Bonus Action to repeat the 
command word or until you use another function 
of the gem.
Second Command Word. You expend 1 charge and 
cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at 
one creature you can see within 60 feet of your-
self. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Consti-
tution saving throw or have the Blinded condition 
for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself 
on a success.
Third Command Word. You expend 5 charges and 
cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30-
foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a sav-
ing throw as if struck by the beam created with 
the second command word.
When all of the gem’s charges are expended, the 
gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.

cause the armor to assume the appearance of a nor-
mal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You

accessories—but the armor retains its normal bulk 
and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you 
use this property again or doff the armor.
Gloves of Missile Snaring
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
If you’re hit by an attack roll made with a Ranged 
or Thrown weapon while wearing these gloves, you 
can take a Reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 
plus your Dexterity modifier if you have a free hand. 
If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the am-
munition or weapon if it is small enough for you to 
hold in that hand.
Gloves of Swimming and Climbing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While wearing these gloves, you have a Climb Speed 
and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed, and you gain 
a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to

charge and make a ranged attack with the weapon, 
hurling it as if it had the Thrown property with a 
normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. 
If the attack hits, the weapon unleashes a thunder-
clap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every 
creature within 30 feet of it other than you must 
succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or 
have the Stunned condition until the end of your 
next turn. Immediately after hitting or missing, the 
weapon flies back to your hand. The weapon re-
gains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.
 Giant’s Bane. While you are attuned to the 
weapon and wearing either a Belt of Giant Strength 
or Gauntlets of Ogre Power to which you are also at-
tuned, you gain the following benefits:

tion saving throw or die.

Handy Haversack
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This backpack has a central pouch and two side 
pouches, each of which is an extradimensional 
space. Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds 
of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet. 
The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of ma-
terial, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The 
haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its 
contents.
    Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a 
Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When 
you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the 
item is always magically on top.
    If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or 
torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the 
haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, 
although an Artifact always turns up again some-
where. If the haversack is turned inside out, its con-
tents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must 
be put right before it can be used again.
    Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for 
10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of 
breathing creatures inside.
    Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional 
space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, 
or similar item instantly destroys both items and 
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind 
Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in 
a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate 
then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be 
reopened.
Hat of Disguise
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this hat, you can cast the Disguise 
Self spell. The spell ends if the hat is removed.
Headband of Intellect
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
Your Intelligence is 19 while you wear this head-
band. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is 
19 or higher without it.
Helm of Brilliance
Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
This helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 
3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from 
the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are 
removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.
  You gain the following benefits while wearing the 
helm.
 Diamond Light. As long as it has at least one 
diamond, the helm emits a 30-foot Emanation. 
When at least one Undead is within that area, the 
Emanation is filled with Dim Light. Any Undead 
that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 Radiant 
damage.
 Fire Opal Flames. As long as the helm has at least 
one fire opal, you can take a Magic action to cause 
one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. 
The flames emit Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and 
Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are 
harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with 
an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes 
an extra 1d6 Fire damage. The flames last until you 
take a Bonus Action to extinguish them or until you 
drop or stow the weapon.
 Ruby Resistance. As long as the helm has at least 
one ruby, you have Resistance to Fire damage.
 Spells. You can cast one of the following spells 
(save DC 18), using one of the helm’s gems of the 
specified type as a component: Daylight (opa l), Fire-
ball (fire opal), Prismatic Spray (diamond), or Wall of 
Fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is 
cast and disappears from the helm.
 Taking Fire Damage. Roll 1d20 if you are wearing 
the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing 
a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the 
helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems 
and is then destroyed. Each creature within a 60-
foot Emanation originating from you must succeed 
on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a 
beam, taking Radiant damage equal to the number 
of gems in the helm.
Helm of Comprehending Languages
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
While wearing this helm, you can cast Comprehend 
Languages from it.
Helm of Telepathy
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this helm, you have telepathy with a 
range of 30 feet, and you can cast Detect Thoughts 
or Suggestion (save DC 13) from the helm. Once ei-
ther spell is cast from the helm, that spell can’t be 
cast from it again until the next dawn.
Helm of Teleportation
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can 
expend 1 charge to cast Teleport from it. The helm 
regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Holy Avenger
Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Legendary (Requires 
Attunement by a Paladin)
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. When you hit a Fiend 
or an Undead with it, that creature takes an extra 
2d10 Radiant damage.
    While you hold the drawn weapon, it creates a 
10-foot Emanation originating from you. You and all 
creatures Friendly to you in the Emanation have Ad-
vantage on saving throws against spells and other 
magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the 
Paladin class, the size of the Emanation increases to 
30 feet.
Horn of Blasting
Wondrous Item, Rare 
You can take a Magic action to blow the horn, which 
emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot Cone that is 
audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the Cone 
makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a 
failed save, a creature takes 5d8 Thunder damage 
and has the Deafened condition for 1 minute. On a 
successful save, a creature takes half as much dam-
age only. Glass or crystal objects in the Cone that 
aren’t being worn or carried take 10d8 Thunder 
damage.
    Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent 
chance of causing the horn to explode. The ex-
plosion deals 10d6 Force damage to the user and 
destroys the horn.
Horn of Valhalla
Wondrous Item, Rare (Silver or Brass), Very Rare 
(Bronze), or Legendary (Iron) 
You can take a Magic action to blow this horn. In 
response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard 
appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. 
Each spirit uses the Berserker stat block and re-
turns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 
Hit Points. The spirits look like living, breathing 
warriors, and they have Immunity to the Charmed 
and Frightened conditions. Once you use the horn, it 
can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.
    Four types of Horn of Valhalla are known to ex-
ist, each made of a different metal. The horn’s type 
determines how many spirits it summons, as well 
as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the 
horn’s type or determines it randomly by rolling on 
the following table.
    If you blow the horn without meeting its require-
ment, the summoned spirits attack you. If you meet 
the requirement, they are Friendly to you and your 
allies and follow your commands.

Horseshoes of a Zephyr
Wondrous Item, Very Rare 
These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic 
action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the 
hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the 
horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a 
horseshoe also takes a Magic action.
  While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a 
horse or similar creature, they allow the creature 
to move normally while floating 4 inches above a 
surface. This effect means the creature can cross 
or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such 
as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and 
ignores Difficult Terrain. In addition, the creature 
can travel for up to 12 hours a day without gaining 
Exhaustion levels from extended travel.
Horseshoes of Speed
Wondrous Item, Rare 
These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic 
action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the 
hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the 
horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a 
horseshoe also takes a Magic action.
    While all four horseshoes are attached to the 
same creature, its Speed is increased by 30 feet.
Immovable Rod
Rod, Uncommon 
This iron rod has a button on one end. You can take 
a Utilize action to press the button, which causes 
the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you 
or another creature takes a Utilize action to push 
the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it 
defies gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds 
of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate 
and fall. A creature can take a Utilize action to make 
a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check, moving the fixed 
rod up to 10 feet on a successful check.
Instant Fortress
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
As a Magic action, you can place this 1-inch 
adamantine statuette on the ground and, using 
a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a 
square adamantine tower. Repeating the command 

System Reference Document 5.2
226
word causes the tower to revert to statuette form, 
which works only if the tower is empty. Each crea-
ture in the area where the tower appears is pushed 
to an unoccupied space outside but next to the 
tower. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or 
carried are also pushed clear of the tower.
    The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, 
with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop 
it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a lad-
der, staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting 
them. This ladder, staircase, or ramp ends at a trap-
door leading to the roof. When created, the tower 
has a single door at ground level on the side facing 
you. The door opens only at your command, which 
you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the 
Knock spell and similar magic.
    Magic prevents the tower from being tipped over. 
The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20; HP 
100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slash-
ing damage except that which is dealt by siege equip-
ment; and Resistance to all other damage. Shrinking 
the tower back down to statuette form doesn’t repair 
damage to the tower. Only a Wish spell can repair the 
tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a 
spell of level 8 or lower). Each casting of Wish causes 
the tower to regain all its Hit Points.
Ioun Stone
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)
Roughly marble sized, Ioun Stones are named after 
Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on 
some worlds. Many types of Ioun Stones exist, each 
type a distinct combination of shape and color.
    When you take a Magic action to toss an Ioun 
Stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at a 
distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you 
while doing so. You can have up to three Ioun Stones 
orbiting your head at the same time.
    Each    Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered 
to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone 
avoids contact with other creatures and objects, ad-
justing its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all 
attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.
    As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any 
number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your 
Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it’s orbit-
ing your head, the stone falls as though you had 
dropped it.
    The type of stone determines its rarity and 
effects.
 Absorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender 
ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction 
to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a crea-
ture you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and 
any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the 
stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, 
turns dull gray, and loses its magic.
 Agility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity increases by 
2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep-red sphere 
orbits your head.
 Awareness (Rare). While this dark-blue rhomboid 
orbits your head, you have Advantage on Initiative 
rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.
 Fortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution in-
creases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink 
rhomboid orbits your head.
 Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this mar-
bled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, 
you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 8 
or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled 
spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast 
it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 lev-
els of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses 
its magic.
 Insight ( Ver y Rare). Your Wisdom increases by 
2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue 
sphere orbits your head.
 Intellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence increases 
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet 
and blue sphere orbits your head.
 Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma increases 
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink 
and green sphere orbits your head.
 Mastery (Legendary). Your Proficiency Bonus in-
creases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your 
head.
 Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to Armor 
Class while this dusty-rose prism orbits your head.
 Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 Hit 
Points at the end of each hour this pearly white 
spindle orbits your head if you have at least 1 Hit 
Point.
 Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores 
spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. 
The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time. 
When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells 
chosen by the GM.
    Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4 
into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The 
spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the 
stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is 
expended without effect. The level of the slot used 
to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
    While this stone orbits your head, you can cast 
any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, 
spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcast-
ing ability of the original caster but is otherwise 
treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from 
the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
 Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength increases by 
2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhom-
boid orbits your head.
 Sustenance (Rare). You don’t need to eat or drink 
while this clear spindle orbits your head.

Iron Bands
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diame-
ter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action 
to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature 
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere 
moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of 
metal bands.
    Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus 
equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Profi-
ciency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained 
condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a 
command that releases it. Doing so or missing with 
the attack causes the bands to contract and become 
a sphere once more.
    A creature that can touch the bands, including the 
one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20 
Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands. 
On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the 
Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any 
further attempts made by that creature automati-
cally fail until 24 hours have elapsed.
    Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again 
until the next dawn.
Iron Flask
Wondrous Item, Legendary 
While holding this brass-stoppered iron flask, you 
can take a Magic action to target a creature that 
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask 
is empty and the target is native to a plane of exis-
tence other than the one you’re on, the target must 
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be 
trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped 
by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save. 
Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until 
released. The flask can hold only one creature at a 
time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t age and 
doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink.
  You can take a Magic action to remove the flask’s 
stopper and release the creature in the flask. The 
creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour, 
understanding those commands even if it doesn’t 
know the language in which the commands are 
given. If you issue no commands or give the crea-
ture a command that is likely to result in its death 
or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise 
takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the 
creature acts in accordance with its normal disposi-
tion and alignment.
    An    Identify spell reveals if the flask contains a 
creature, but the only way to determine the type 
of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered 
Iron Flask might already contain a creature chosen 
by the GM.
Javelin of Lightning
Weapon (Javelin), Uncommon 
Each time you make an attack roll with this magic 
weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning dam-
age instead of Piercing damage.
 Lightning Bolt. When you throw this weapon at 
a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can 
forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn 
the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms 
a 5-foot-wide Line between you and the target. The 
target and each other creature in the Line (exclud-
ing you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, tak-
ing 4d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half 
as much damage on a successful one. Immediately 
after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in 
your hand. This property can’t be used again until 
the next dawn.
Lantern of Revealing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 
pint of oil, shedding Bright Light in a 30-foot radius 
and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible 
creatures and objects are visible as long as they are 
in the lantern’s Bright Light. You can take a Utilize 
action to lower the hood, reducing the lantern’s light 
to Dim Light in a 5-foot radius.
Luck Blade
Weapon (Glaive, Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, 
Scimitar, Sickle, or Shortsword), Legendary (Requires 
Attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. While the weapon is 
on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving 
throws.
 Luck. If the weapon is on your person, you can call 
on its luck (no action required) to reroll one failed 
D20 Test if you don’t have the Incapacitated condi-
tion. You must use the second roll. Once used, this 
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 Wish. The weapon has 1d3 charges. While holding 
it, you can expend 1 charge and cast Wish from it. 
Once used, this property can’t be used again until 
the next dawn. The weapon loses this property if it 
has no charges.
Mace of Disruption
Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)
When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this magic 
weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 Radiant 
damage. If the target has 25 Hit Points or fewer 
after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 
15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a suc-
cessful save, the creature has the Frightened condi-
tion until the end of your next turn.

Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an addi-
tional 20 feet.
Mace of Smiting
Weapon (Mace), Rare 
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage 
rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus in-
creases to +3 when you use the weapon to attack a 
Construct.
    When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with 
this weapon, the target takes an extra 7 Bludgeon-
ing damage, or 14 Bludgeoning damage if it’s a 
Construct. If a Construct has 25 Hit Points or fewer 
after taking this damage, it is destroyed.
Mace of Terror
Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)
This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3 
expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the 
weapon, you can take a Magic action and expend 
1 charge to release a wave of terror from it. Each 
creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must 
succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have 
the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While Fright-
ened in this way, a creature must spend its turns 
trying to move as far away from you as it can, and 
it can’t make Opportunity Attacks. For its action, it 
can use only the Dash action or try to escape from 
an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has no-
where it can move, the creature can take the Dodge 
action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature 
repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a 
success.
Mantle of Spell Resistance
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
You have Advantage on saving throws against spells 
while you wear this cloak.
Manual of Bodily Health
Wondrous Item, Very Rare 
This book contains health and nutrition tips, and 
its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 
hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the 
book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your 
Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. 
The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a 
cent ur y.
Manual of Gainful Exercise
Wondrous Item, Very Rare

are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over 
a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s con-
tents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength 
increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual 
then loses its magic but regains it in a century.
Manual of Golems
Wondrous Item, Very Rare 
This tome contains information and incantations 
necessary to make a particular type of golem. The 
GM chooses the type or determines it randomly by 
rolling on the accompanying table. To decipher and 
use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at 
least two level 5 spell slots. A creature that can’t 
use a Manual of Golems and attempts to read it takes 
6d6 Psychic damage.
    To create a golem, you must spend the time shown 
on the table, working without interruption with the 
manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours 
per day. You must also pay the specified cost to pur-
chase supplies.
  Once you finish creating the golem, the book is 
consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes 
animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled 
on it. See “Monsters” for the golem’s stat block. The 
golem is under your control, and it understands and 
obeys your commands.

ercises, and its words are charged with magic. 
If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or 
fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing

but regains it in a century.
Marvelous Pigments
Wondrous Item, Very Rare 
This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment 
and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total).
    Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, 
you can paint any number of three-dimensional 
objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, 
trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided 
these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube. 
The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the num-
ber of elements you create), during which time you 
must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentra-
tion. If your Concentration is broken or you leave 
the Cube before the work is done, all the painted 
elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.

System Reference Document 5.2
229
    When the work is done, all the painted objects 
and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a 
door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be 
opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates 
a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within 
the 20-foot Cube.
    No object created by a pot of pigment can have a 
value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all 
objects created by a pot of pigment can’t exceed 500 
GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a 
large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close in-
spection reveals they’re made from paste, cookies, 
or some other worthless material.
  If you paint a form of energy such as fire or light-
ning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete 
the painting, doing no harm.
Medallion of Thoughts
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
The medallion has 5 charges. While wearing it, you 
can expend 1 charge to cast Detect Thoughts (save 
DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d4 expended 
charges daily at dawn.
Mirror of Life Trapping
Wondrous Item, Very Rare 
When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed 
indirectly, its surface shows faint images of crea-
tures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 
11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, 
and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shat-
ters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.
    If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and 
you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic 
action and use a command word to activate it. It 
remains activated until you take a Magic action and 
repeat the command word to deactivate it.
  Any creature other than you that sees its reflec-
tion in the activated mirror while within 30 feet 
of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma 
saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it 
is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve 
extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the 
mirror’s nature makes the save with Advantage, 
and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.
  An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse 
filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 
feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t 
age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A 
creature trapped within a cell can escape using 
magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the 
creature is confined to the cell until freed.
     If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve ex-
tradimensional cells are already occupied, the mir-
ror frees one trapped creature at random to accom-
modate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears 
in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror 
but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, 
all creatures it contains are freed and appear in un-
occupied spaces near it.
    While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a 
Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or 
call out a particular cell by number. The creature 
named or contained in the named cell appears as an 
image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature 
can then communicate.
    In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and 
use a second command word to free one creature 
trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, 
along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space 
nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.
    Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional 
space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, 
or similar item instantly destroys both items and 
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind 
Total Cover is sucked through it to a random loca-
tion on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The 
gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.
Mithral Armor
Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor), 
Uncommon 
Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Armor made of this 
substance can be worn under normal clothes. If the 
armor normally imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the 
mithral version of the armor doesn’t.
Mysterious Deck
Wondrous Item, Legendary 
Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains 
a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most 
(75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but 
some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column 
of the Mysterious Deck table when randomly deter-
mining cards drawn from the deck.
    Before you draw a card, you must declare how 
many cards you intend to draw and then draw them 
randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this num-
ber have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a 
card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must 
draw each card no more than 1 hour after the pre-
vious draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, 
the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on 
their own and take effect all at once.
    Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the 
card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the 
deck, making it possible to draw the same card 
twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, re-
roll on the table if that card comes up again.)

    Each card’s effect is described below.
 Balance. You can increase one of your ability 
scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also 
decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. 
You can’t decrease an ability that has a score of 5 
or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to ad-
just your ability scores, in which case this card has 
no effect.
 Comet. The next time you enter combat against 
one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one 
of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you 
reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, 
you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 
year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 
Hit Points or you don’t choose a foe, this card has no 
effect.
 Donjon. You disappear and become entombed 
in a state of suspended animation in an extradi-
mensional sphere. Everything you’re wearing and 
carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, 
which stay behind in the space you occupied when 
you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you 
are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t 
be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell 
can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no 
more cards.
 Euryale. The card’s medusa-like visage curses 
you. You take a −2 penalty to saving throws while 
cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the 
Fates card can end this curse.
 Fates. Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, al-
lowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never 
happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon 
as you draw the card or at any other time before 
you die.
 Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. 
The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savor-
ing your suffering before attempting to slay you. 
This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.
 Fool. You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the 
next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn’t 
count as one of your declared draws.
 Gem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 
GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at 
your feet.
 Jester. You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the 
next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards 
beyond your declared draws.
 Key. A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which 
you are proficient appears on your person. The GM 
chooses the weapon.
 Knight. You gain the service of a Knight, who 
magically appears in an unoccupied space you 
choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the 
same alignment as you and serves you loyally until 
death, believing the two of you have been drawn to-
gether by fate. Work with your GM to create a name 
and backstory for this NPC. The GM can use a differ-
ent stat block to represent the knight, as desired.
 Moon. You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.
 Puzzle. Permanently reduce your Intelligence or 
Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You 
can draw one additional card beyond your declared 
draws.
 Rogue. An NPC of the GM’s choice becomes Hostile 
toward you. You don’t know the identity of this NPC 
until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less 
than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the 
NPC’s hostility toward you.
 Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, 
other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable 
property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land 
you own are lost in a way that alters reality the 
least. Any documentation that proves you should 
own something lost to this card also disappears.
 Sage. At any time you choose within one year of 
drawing this card, you can ask a question in medita-
tion and mentally receive a truthful answer to that 
question.
 Skull. An Avatar of Death (see the accompanying 
stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close 

System Reference Document 5.2
231
to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with 
its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a 
tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. 
The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points 
or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the 
avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. 
The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as 
close to that ally as possible and targets only that 
ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each 
summon only one avatar as a consequence of this 
draw. A creature slain by an avatar can’t be restored 
to life.
 Star. Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a 
maximum of 24.
 Sun. A magic item (chosen by the GM) appears on 
your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit 
Points daily at dawn until you die.
 Talons. Every magic item you wear or carry 
disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish 
instead.
 Throne. You gain proficiency and Expertise in 
your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Per-
suasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of 
a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the 
keep is currently home to one or more monsters, 
which must be cleared out before you can claim the 
keep as yours.
 Void. Your soul is drawn from your body and 
contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice. 
One or more powerful beings guard the place. While 
your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, 
ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A 
Wish spell can’t return your soul to your body, but 
the spell reveals the location of the object that holds 
your soul. You draw no more cards.

other creatures and objects as if they were Difficult 
Terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) Force damage if it ends its turn 
inside an object.
Actions
Multiattack. The avatar makes a number of Reaping 
Scythe attacks equal to half the summoner’s Proficiency 
Bonus (rounded up).

Necklace of Adaptation
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this necklace, you can breathe nor-
mally in any environment, and you have Advantage 
on saving throws made to avoid or end the Poisoned 
condition.
Necklace of Fireballs
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. 
You can take a Magic action to detach a bead and 
throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end 
of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 Fire-
ball (save DC 15).
    You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole 
necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the 
damage of the Fireball by 1d6 for each bead after 
the first (maximum 12d6).
Necklace of Prayer Beads
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a 
Cleric, Druid, or Paladin)
This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from 
aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many 
nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, 
bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a 
magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead 
loses its magic.
    Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the 
type of each bead on the necklace or determines it 
randomly by rolling on the table below. A necklace 
can have more than one bead of the same type. To 
use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each 
bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a 
Bonus Action (using your spell save DC if a save is 
necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that 
bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Nine Lives Stealer
Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Very Rare (Requires 
Attunement)
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon.
 Life Stealing. The weapon has 1d8 + 1 charges. 
When you attack a creature that has fewer than 
100 Hit Points with this weapon and roll a 20 on the 
d20 for the attack roll, the creature must succeed 
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain 
instantly as the sword tears its life force from its 
body. Constructs and Undead succeed on the save 
automatically. The weapon loses 1 charge if the 
creature is slain. When the weapon has no charges 
remaining, it loses this property.
Oathbow
Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires 
Attunement)
When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in 
Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use 
this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can utter 
or sign the following command words: “Swift death 
to you who have wronged me.” The target of your 
attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or 
until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such 
sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy 
dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.
    When you make a ranged attack roll with this 
weapon against your sworn enemy, you have Ad-
vantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no 
benefit from Half Cover or Three-Quarters Cover, 
and you suffer no Disadvantage due to long range. 
If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 
3d6 Piercing damage.
    While your sworn enemy lives, you have Disad-
vantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.
Oil of Etherealness
Potion, Rare 
One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller 
creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and 
carrying (one additional vial is required for each 
size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 
10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the 
effect of the Etherealness spell for 1 hour.
    Beads of this cloudy, gray oil form on the outside 
of its container and quickly evaporate.
Oil of Sharpness
Potion, Very Rare 
One vial of this oil can coat one Melee weapon or 
twenty pieces of ammunition, but only ammunition 
and Melee weapons that are nonmagical and deal 
Slashing or Piercing damage are affected. Applying 
the oil takes 1 minute, after which the oil magically 
seeps into whatever it coats, turning the coated 
weapon into a +3 Weapon or the coated ammunition 
into +3 Ammunition.
    This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, 
ultrathin silver shards.
Oil of Slipperiness
Potion, Uncommon 
One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller 
creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and 
carrying (one additional vial is required for each 
size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 
10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the ef-
fect of the Freedom of Movement spell for 8 hours.
    Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground 
as a Magic action, where it covers a 10-foot square, 
duplicating the effect of the Grease spell in that area 
for 8 hours.
    This sticky, black unguent is thick and heavy, but 
it flows quickly when poured. 
Pearl of Power
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by 
a Spellcaster)
While this pearl is on your person, you can take a 
Magic action to regain one expended spell slot of 
level 3 or lower. Once you use the pearl, it can’t be 
used again until the next dawn.
Periapt of Health
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this pendant, you can take a Magic 
action to regain 2d4 + 2 Hit Points. Once used, this 
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
    In addition, you have Advantage on saving throws 
to avoid or end the Poisoned condition while you 
wear this pendant.
Periapt of Proof against Poison
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black 
gem pendant. While you wear it, you have Immunity 
to the Poisoned condition and Poison damage.
Periapt of Wound Closure
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this pendant, you gain the following 
benefits.
 Life Preservation. Whenever you make a Death 
Saving Throw, you can change a roll of 9 or lower to 
a 10, turning a failed save into a successful one.
 Natural Healing Boost. Whenever you roll a Hit 
Point Die to regain Hit Points, double the number of 
Hit Points it restores.

Philter of Love
Potion, Uncommon 
The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes 
after drinking this philter, you are charmed by that 
creature and have the Charmed condition for 1 
hour.
    This rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one 
easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
Pipes of Haunting
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 ex-
pended charges daily at dawn. You can take a Magic 
action to play them and expend 1 charge to create 
an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature of your 
choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 
15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened 
condition for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save 
repeats it at the end of each of its turns, ending the 
effect on itself on a success. A creature that suc-
ceeds on its save is immune to the effect of these 
pipes for 24 hours.
Pipes of the Sewers
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rats 
and giant rats are Indifferent toward you and won’t 
attack you unless you threaten or harm them.
    The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 ex-
pended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes 
as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus Action to 
expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one Swarm 
of Rats with each expended charge if enough rats 
are within half a mile of you to be called in this 
fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t 
enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. 
Called swarms move toward the music by the short-
est available route but aren’t under your control 
otherwise.
    Whenever a Swarm of Rats that isn’t under an-
other creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you 
while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes 
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful 
save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and 
can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 
hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the 
pipes’ music and becomes Friendly to you and your 
allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes 
each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm 
obeys your commands. If you issue no commands 
to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise 
takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn 
more than 30 feet away from you, your control over 
that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it nor-
mally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ mu-
sic for the next 24 hours.
Plate Armor of Etherealness
Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Legendary 
(Requires Attunement)
While you’re wearing this armor, you can take a 
Magic action and use a command word to gain the 
effect of the Etherealness spell. The spell ends imme-
diately if you remove the armor or take a Magic ac-
tion to repeat the command word. This property of 
the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Portable Hole
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the 
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a cir-
cular sheet 6 feet in diameter.
    You can take a Magic action to unfold a Porta-
ble Hole and place it on or against a solid surface, 
whereupon the Portable Hole creates an extradi-
mensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space 
within the hole exists on a different plane of exis-
tence, so it can’t be used to create open passages. 
Any creature inside an open Portable Hole can exit 
the hole by climbing out of it.
    You can take a Magic action to close a Portable 
Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and 
folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and 
any creatures or objects within remain in the ex-
tradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the 
hole weighs next to nothing.
    If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s 
extradimensional space can take an action to make 
a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful 
check, the creature forces its way out and appears 
within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable 
Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, di-
vided by the number of breathing creatures inside.
    Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional 
space created by a Bag of Holding, Handy Haversack, 
or similar item instantly destroys both items and 
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind 
Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in 
a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate 
then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be 
reopened.
Potion of Animal Friendship
Potion, Uncommon 
When you drink this potion, you can cast the level 
3 version of the Animal Friendship spell (save DC 13).
    Agitating this potion’s muddy liquid brings little 
bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird feather, a 
cat claw, or a squirrel hair.

Potion of Clairvoyance
Potion, Rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of 
the Clairvoyance spell (no Concentration required).
    An eyeball bobs in this potion’s yellowish liquid 
but vanishes when the potion is opened.
Potion of Climbing
Potion, Common 
When you drink this potion, you gain a Climb Speed 
equal to your Speed for 1 hour. During this time, you 
have Advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to 
climb.
    This potion is separated into brown, silver, and 
gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the 
bottle fails to mix the colors.
Potion of Diminution
Potion, Rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” 
effect of the Enlarge/Reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no 
Concentration required).
    The red in the potion’s liquid continuously con-
tracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the 
clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to in-
terrupt this process.
Potion of Flying
Potion, Very Rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain a Fly Speed 
equal to your Speed for 1 hour and can hover. If 
you’re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall 
unless you have some other means of staying aloft.
  This potion’s clear liquid floats at the top of its 
container and has cloudy white impurities drifting 
in it.
Potion of Gaseous Form
Potion, Rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of 
the Gaseous Form spell for 1 hour (no Concentration 
required) or until you end the effect as a Bonus 
Action.
    This potion’s container seems to hold fog that 
moves and pours like water.
Potion of Giant Strength
Potion, Rarity Varies 
When you drink this potion, your Strength score 
changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the 
score (see the table below). The potion has no effect 
on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than 
that score.
  This potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a 
sliver of light resembling a giant’s fingernail.

pands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid

Potions of Healing
Potion, Rarity Varies 
You regain Hit Points when you drink this potion. 
The number of Hit Points depends on the potion’s

mers when agitated.

    This potion’s blue liquid bubbles and steams as if 
boiling.
Potion of Invisibility
Potion, Rare 
This potion’s container looks empty but feels as 
though it holds liquid. When you drink the potion, 
you have the Invisible condition for 1 hour. The 
effect ends early if you make an attack roll, deal 
damage, or cast a spell.

Potion of Mind Reading
Potion, Rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of 
the Detect Thoughts spell (save DC 13) for 10 min-
utes (no Concentration required). 
    This potion’s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid 
cloud of pink floating in it.
Potion of Poison
Potion, Uncommon 
This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a 
Potion of Healing or another beneficial potion. How-
ever, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. 
Identify reveals its true nature.

Ring of Djinni Summoning
Ring, Legendary (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this ring, you can take a Magic action 
to summon a particular Djinni from the Elemental 
Plane of Air. The djinni appears in an unoccupied 
space you choose within 120 feet of yourself. It 
remains as long as you maintain Concentration, to a 
maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 Hit Points.
    While summoned, the djinni is Friendly to you and 
your allies, and it obeys your commands. If you fail 
to command it, the djinni defends itself against at-
tackers but takes no other actions.
    After the djinni departs, it can’t be summoned 
again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagi-
cal if the djinni dies.
 Rings of Djinni Summoning are often created by the 
djinn they summon and given to mortals as gifts of 
friendship or tokens of esteem. 
Ring of Elemental Command
Ring, Legendary (Requires Attunement)
Each Ring of Elemental Command is linked to one of

determine what it does with its move and action 
on its next turn.

benefit from additional properties corresponding to

    You can take a Magic action to cause the ring to 
become imperceptible until you take another Magic 
action to make it perceptible, until you remove the 
ring, or until you die.
    If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters 
it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in 
the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your 
soul is in the ring, you can telepathically commu-
nicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can’t 
prevent this telepathic communication.

throws while wearing this ring.

Ring of Shooting Stars
Ring, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
You can cast Dancing Lights or Light from the ring.
    The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended 
charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges 
to use the properties below.
 Faerie Fire. You can expend 1 charge to cast Fa-
erie Fire from the ring.
 Lightning Spheres. You can expend 2 charges as 
a Magic action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter 
spheres of lightning.
    Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you 
can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres 
last as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 
minute. Each sphere sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot 
radius.
    As a Bonus Action, you can move each sphere up 
to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from 
yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 
feet of a creature other than you that isn’t behind 
Total Cover, the sphere discharges lightning at that 
creature and disappears. That creature makes a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the 
creature takes Lightning damage based on the num-
ber of spheres you created, as shown in the follow-
ing table. On a successful save, the creature takes 
half as much damage.

a Magic action. For every charge you expend, you 
launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a 
point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each 
creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from that 
point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 
Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Radiant damage 
on a failed save or half as much damage on a suc-
cessful one.
Ring of Spell Storing
Ring, Rare (Requires Attunement)
This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them un-
til the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store 
up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, 
it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by 
the GM.
    Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 5 
into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. 
The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the 
ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the spell is ex-
pended without effect. The level of the slot used to 
cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
    While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell 
stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save 
DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of 
the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you 
cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no lon-
ger stored in it, freeing up space.
Ring of Spell Turning
Ring, Legendary (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this ring, you have Advantage on 
saving throws against spells. If you succeed on the 
save for a spell of level 7 or lower, the spell has no 
effect on you. If that spell targeted only you and 
didn’t create an area of effect, you can take a Reac-
tion to deflect the spell back at the spell’s caster; the 
caster must make a saving throw against the spell 
using their own spell save DC.
Ring of Swimming

You have a Swim Speed of 40 feet while wearing this 
ring.
Ring of Telekinesis

charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you 
can take a Magic action to expend 1 to 3 charges to 
make a ranged spell attack against one creature you 
can see within 60 feet of yourself. The ring produces 
a spectral ram’s head and makes its attack roll with 
a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the 
target takes 2d10 Force damage and is pushed 5 
feet away from you.
    Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring’s 
charges as a Magic action to try to break a nonmag-
ical object you can see within 60 feet of yourself 
that isn’t being worn or carried. The ring makes 
a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge 
you spend.

While wearing this ring, you can take a Magic ac-
tion to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 
1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius 
appear transparent and don’t prevent light from 
passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 
foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet 
of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet 
of lead block the vision.
    Whenever you use the ring again before taking a 
Long Rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitu-
tion saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level.
Robe of Eyes
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While 
you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:
All-Around Vision. The robe gives you Advantage 
on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
Special Senses. You have Darkvision and Truesight, 
both with a range of 120 feet.
 Drawbacks. A Light spell cast on the robe or a 
Daylight spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives 
you the Blinded condition for 1 minute. At the end of 
each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving 
throw (DC 11 for Light or DC 15 for Daylight), ending 
the condition on yourself on a success.
Robe of Scintillating Colors
Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
This robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 ex-
pended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, 
you can take a Magic action and expend 1 charge 
to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern 
of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. 
During this time, the robe sheds Bright Light in a 
30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 
feet, and creatures that can see you have Disadvan-
tage on attack rolls against you. Any creature in the 
Bright Light that can see you when the robe’s power 
is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom sav-
ing throw or have the Stunned condition until the 
effect ends. 
Robe of Stars
Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

tion, are particularly large. While wearing this 
robe, you can take a Magic action to remove one of 
the stars and expend it to cast the level 5 version of 
Magic Missile. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars re-
appear on the robe.
    While you wear the robe, you can take a Magic ac-
tion to enter the Astral Plane along with everything 
you are wearing and carrying. You remain there 
until you take a Magic action to return to the plane 
you were on. You reappear in the last space you 
occupied or, if that space is occupied, the nearest 
unoccupied space.
Robe of the Archmagi
Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement by a 
Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)

colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can 
take a Magic action to detach one of the patches, 
causing it to become the object or creature it rep-
resents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe 
becomes an ordinary garment.
    The robe has two of each of the following patches:
• Bullseye Lantern (filled and lit)
• Dagger
• Mirror
• Pole
• Rope (coiled)
• Sack
In addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches. The GM

Rod of Absorption
Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
While holding this rod, you can take a Reaction to 
absorb a spell that is targeting only you and doesn’t 
create an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s effect 
is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell 
itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same 
level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell 
dissipates with no effect, and any resources used 
to cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store 
up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its ex-
istence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, 
it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell 
that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that 
spell.
    When you become attuned to the rod, you know 
how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed 
over the course of its existence and how many levels 
of spell energy it currently has stored.
    If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can 
convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast 
spells you have prepared or know. You can create 
spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your 
own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use 
the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise 
cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 
levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot.
    A newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of 
spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer 
absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining 
becomes nonmagical.
Rod of Alertness
Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
This rod has the following properties.
 Alertness. While holding the rod, you have 
Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on 
Initiative rolls.
 Spells. While holding the rod, you can cast the fol-
lowing spells from it:
• Detect Evil and Good
• Detect Magic
• Detect Poison and Disease
• See Invisibility
 Protective Aura. As a Magic action, you can plant 
the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon 
the rod’s head sheds Bright Light in a 60-foot radius 
and Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. While in 
that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1 
bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can 
sense the location of any Invisible creature that is 
also in the Bright Light.
    The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends 
after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a Magic 
action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, 
this property can’t be used again until the next 
dawn.
Rod of Lordly Might
Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)
This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a 
magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls 
and damage rolls made with it. The rod has proper-
ties associated with six different buttons that are 
set in a row along the haft. It has three other prop-
erties as well, detailed below.
 Buttons. You can press one of the following but-
tons as a Bonus Action; a button’s effect lasts until 
you push a different button or until you push the 
same button again, which causes the rod to revert 
to its normal form:
Button 1. A fiery blade sprouts from the end op-
posite the rod’s flanged head. The flames shed 
Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for 
an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as 
a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) 
that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.
Button 2. The rod’s flanged head folds down and 
two crescent-shaped blades spring out, trans-
forming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants 
a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made 
with it.

System Reference Document 5.2
240
Button 3. The rod’s flanged head folds down, a 
spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the 
rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, trans-
forming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a 
+3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made 
with it.
Button 4. The rod transforms into a climbing pole 
up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though 
the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In 
surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bot-
tom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. 
Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the 
sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can 
bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of 
solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its 
normal form.
Button 5. The rod transforms into a handheld 
battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus 
to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break 
through doors, barricades, and other barriers.
Button 6. The rod assumes or remains in its nor-
mal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing 
happens if this function of the rod is used in a 
location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also 
gives you knowledge of your approximate depth 
beneath the ground or your height above it.
 Drain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee 
attack using the rod, you can force the target to 
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed 
save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic dam-
age, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to 
half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 Paralyze. When you hit a creature with a melee 
attack using the rod, you can force the target to 
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed 
save, the target has the Paralyzed condition for 1 
minute. The target repeats the save at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. 
Once used, this property can’t be used again until 
the next dawn.
 Terrify. While holding the rod, you can take a 
Magic action to force each creature you can see 
within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the 
Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened 
target repeats the save at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once 
used, this property can’t be used again until the 
next dawn.
Rod of Rulership
Rod, Rare (Requires Attunement)
You can take a Magic action to present the rod and 
command obedience from each creature of your 
choice that you can see within 120 feet of yourself. 
Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom sav-
ing throw or have the Charmed condition for 8 
hours. While Charmed in this way, the creature re-
gards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or 
your allies or commanded to do something contrary 
to its nature, a target ceases to be Charmed in this 
way. Once used, this property can’t be used again 
until the next dawn.
Rod of Security
Rod, Very Rare 
While holding this rod, you can take a Magic action 
to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you 
and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see 
to a demiplane. You choose the form the demiplane 
takes. It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern, 
an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic car-
nival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless 
of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water 
and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane’s 
environment can’t harm its occupants. Everything 
else that can be interacted with there can exist 
only there. For example, a flower picked from a 
garden there disappears if it is taken outside the 
demiplane.
    For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor 
regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die. 
Also, creatures don’t age while there, although time 
passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to 
200 days divided by the number of creatures pres-
ent (round down).
    When the time runs out or you take a Magic action 
to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the loca-
tion they occupied when you activated the rod or an 
unoccupied space nearest that location. Once used, 
this property can’t be used again until 10 days have 
passed.
Rope of Climbing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This 60-foot length of rope can hold up to 3,000 
pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can 
take a Magic action to command the other end of the 
rope to animate and move toward a destination you 
choose, up to the rope’s length away from you. That 
end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first com-
mand it and 10 feet at the start of each of your sub-
sequent turns until reaching its destination or until 
you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten 
itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to 
knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.
    If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 
1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the 
rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advan-
tage on ability checks made to climb using the rope.
    The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poi-
son and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 

System Reference Document 5.2
241
5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the 
rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.
Rope of Entanglement
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of 
the rope, you can take a Magic action to command 
the other end to dart forward and entangle one 
creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The 
target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw or have the Restrained condition. You can re-
lease the target by letting go of your end of the rope 
(causing the rope to coil up in the target’s space) 
or by using a Bonus Action to repeat the command 
(causing the rope to coil up in your hand).
    A target Restrained by the rope can take an action 
to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check, 
the target is no longer Restrained by the rope. If 
you’re still holding onto the rope when a target es-
capes from it, you can take a Reaction to command 
the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope 
coils up in the target’s space. 
    The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poi-
son and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 
5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the 
rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.
Scarab of Protection
Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)
This beetle-shaped medallion provides three bene-
fits while it is on your person.
 Defense. You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.

bles into powder and is destroyed when its last

Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet 
of you, the curse causes you to become the target 
instead.
Slippers of Spider Climbing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While you wear these light shoes, you can move 
up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along 
ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a 
Climb Speed equal to your Speed. However, the slip-
pers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery 
surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.
Sovereign Glue
Wondrous Item, Legendary 
This viscous, milky-white substance can form a per-
manent adhesive bond between any two objects. It 
must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated 
inside with Oil of Slipperiness. When found, a con-
tainer contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.
    One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square 
surface. Applying an ounce of Sovereign Glue takes 
a Utilize action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute 
to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be 
broken only by the application of Universal Solvent 
or Oil of Etherealness, or with a Wish spell.

Spell Scroll
Scroll, Rarity Varies 
A Spell Scroll bears the words of a single spell, writ-
ten in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your spell 
list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell with-
out Material components. Otherwise, the scroll is 
unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll 
requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the 
spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the cast-
ing is interrupted, the scroll isn’t lost.
    If the spell is on your spell list but of a higher level 
than you can normally cast, you make an ability 
check using your spellcasting ability to determine 
whether you cast the spell. The DC equals 10 plus 

System Reference Document 5.2
242
the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disap-
pears from the scroll with no other effect.
    The level of the spell on the scroll determines the 
spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as 
the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the following table.

 Copying a Scroll into a Spellbook. A Wizard spell 
on a Spell Scroll can be copied into a spellbook. 
When a spell is copied in this way, the copier must 
succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a 
DC equal to 10 plus the spell’s level. On a successful 
check, the spell is copied. Whether the check suc-
ceeds or fails, the Spell Scroll is destroyed.
Sphere of Annihilation
Wondrous Item, Legendary 
This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the 
multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a 
magical field surrounding it.
    The sphere obliterates all matter it passes 
through and all matter that passes through it. Ar-
tifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is sus-
ceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it 
passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else 
that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed 
and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.
 Controlling the Sphere. A Sphere of Annihilation is 
stationary until someone takes control of it. If you 
are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic 
action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. 
On a successful check, you control the sphere until 
the start of your next turn, and if it was under an-
other creature’s control, that creature loses control 
of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 
10 feet toward you in a straight line. 
    While in control of the sphere, you can take a 
Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction 
of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 
5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 
feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters 
must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw 
or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A 
creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is 
obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no 
other physical remains.
 Sphere Interactions. If the sphere comes into 
contact with a planar portal (such as that created by 
the Gate spell) or an extradimensional space (such 
as that within a Portable Hole), the GM determines 
randomly what happens using the following table.
1d100Result
01–50The sphere is destroyed.
51– 85The sphere moves through the portal or into 
the extradimensional space.
86–00A spatial rift sends the sphere and each crea-
ture and object within 180 feet of the sphere 
to a random plane of existence.

Staff of the Python
Staff, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
As a Magic action, you can throw this staff so that it 
lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, 
causing the staff to become a Giant Constrictor 
Snake in that space. The snake is under your con-
trol and shares your Initiative count, taking its turn 
immediately after yours. 
    On your turn, you can mentally command the 
snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of 
you and you don’t have the Incapacitated condition. 
You decide what action the snake takes and where it 
moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general 
command, such as to attack your enemies or guard 
a location. Absent commands from you, the snake 
defends itself.
    As a Bonus Action, you can command the snake 
to revert to staff form in its current space, and you 
can’t use the staff’s property again for 1 hour. If the 
snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts

stroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before 
losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.

spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears

in a Line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each

heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without 
the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect 
if it has Immunity to Slashing damage, if it doesn’t 
have or need a head, or if the GM decides that the 
creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this 
weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 30 
Slashing damage from the hit. If the creature has 
Legendary Resistance, it can expend one daily use 
of that trait to avoid losing its head, taking the extra 
damage instead.

Wand of Wonder Effects
1d100Effect
01–20You cast a spell originating from the chosen 
point. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a 
1–2, Darkness; on a 3–4, Faerie Fire; on a 5–6, 
Fireball; on a 7–8, Slow; on a 9–10, Stinking 
Cloud.
21–25Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. 
Instead, you have the Stunned condition until 
the start of your next turn, believing some-
thing awesome just happened.
26–30You cast Gust of Wind. The Line created by the 
spell extends from you to the chosen point of 
origin.
31–35Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. 
Instead, you take 1d6 Psychic damage.
36–40Heavy rain falls for 1 minute in a 120-foot-
high, 60-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the 
chosen point of origin. During that time, the 
area of effect is Lightly Obscured.
41– 45A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 
60-foot-high, 30-foot-radius Cylinder centered 
on the chosen point of origin. The butterflies 
remain for 10 minutes, during which time the 
area of effect is Heavily Obscured.
46–50You cast Lightning Bolt. The Line created by the 
spell extends from you to the chosen point of 
origin.
51– 55The creature closest to the chosen point of 
origin is enlarged as if you had cast Enlarge/
Reduce on it. If the target isn’t you and can’t be 
affected by that spell, you become the target 
instead.
1d100Effect
56–60A magically formed creature appears in an 
unoccupied space as close to the chosen point 
of origin as possible. The creature isn’t under 
your control, acts as it normally would, and 
disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 
Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine which crea-
ture appears. On a 1, a Rhinoceros appears; 
on a 2, an Elephant appears; and on a 3–4, a 
Rat appears.
61– 64Grass covers a 60-foot-radius circle of ground, 
with the center of that circle as close to the 
chosen point of origin as possible. Grass that’s 
already there grows to ten times its normal 
size and remains overgrown for 1 minute.
65–68An object of the GM’s choice disappears into 
the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither 
worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the cho-
sen point of origin, and no larger than 10 feet 
in any dimension. If there are no such objects 
in range, nothing happens.
69–72Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. 
Instead, you shrink as if you had cast Enlarge/
Reduce on yourself and remain in that state for 
1 minute.
73–77Leaves grow from the creature nearest to the 
chosen point of origin. Unless they are picked 
off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 
hours.
78–82Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. 
Instead, a burst of colorful, shimmering light 
extends from you in a 30-foot Emanation. 
Each creature in the area must succeed on a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the 
Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature re-
peats the save at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success.
83–87Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. 
Instead, you cast Invisibility on yourself.
88–92Nothing happens at the chosen point of ori-
gin. Instead, a stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each 
worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand’s tip in a 
Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the 
chosen point of origin. Each gem deals 1 Blud-
geoning damage, and the total damage of the 
gems is divided equally among all creatures in 
the Line.

1d100Effect
93–97You cast Polymorph, targeting the creature 
closest to the chosen point of origin. Roll 1d4 
to determine the target’s new form. On a 1, 
the new form is a Black Bear; on a 2, the 
new form is a Giant Wasp; on a 3–4, the new 
form is a Frog.
98–00The creature closest to the chosen point of 
origin makes a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature has the 
Restrained condition and begins to turn to 
stone. While Restrained in this way, the crea-
ture repeats the save at the end of its next 
turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. 
On a failed save, the creature has the Petrified 
condition instead of the Restrained condition. 
The petrification lasts until the creature is 
freed by the Greater Restoration spell or similar 
magic.
Weapon, +1, +2, or +3

mined by the weapon’s rarity.
Weapon of Warning
Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Uncommon (Requires 
Attunement)

are attuned to it, you and allies within 30 feet of you

ject who is sleeping naturally when combat begins. 
This benefit doesn’t wake a subject from magically 
induced sleep.
 Supernatural Readiness. Each subject has Advan-
tage on its Initiative rolls.
Well of Many Worlds
Wondrous Item, Legendary 
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the 
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a cir-
cular sheet 6 feet in diameter.
    You can take a Magic action to unfold the Well of 
Many Worlds and place it on a solid surface, where-
upon it forms a two-way, 6-foot-diameter, circular 
portal to another world or plane of existence. Each 
time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where 
it leads. The portal remains open until a creature 
within 5 feet of it takes a Magic action to close it 
by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding 
it up.
    Once the Well of Many Worlds has opened a portal, 
it can’t do so again for 1d8 hours.
Wind Fan
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
While holding this fan, you can cast Gust of Wind 
(save DC 13) from it. Each subsequent time the fan 
is used before the next dawn, it has a cumulative 
20 percent chance of not working; if the fan fails to 
work, it tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.
Winged Boots
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
These boots have 4 charges and regain 1d4 ex-
pended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the 
boots, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 
charge, gaining a Fly Speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. If 
you are flying when the duration expires, you de-
scend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.
Wings of Flying
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this cloak, you can take a Magic ac-
tion to turn the cloak into a pair of wings on your 
back. The wings lasts for 1 hour or until you end the 
effect early as a Magic action. The wings give you a 
Fly Speed of 60 feet. If you are aloft when the wings 
disappear, you fall. When the wings disappear, you 
can’t use them again for 1d12 hours.
