#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear in the Druid spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know two Druid cantrips of your choice. Druidcraft and Produce Flame are recommended. Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Druid cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another Druid cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 Druid spells. Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Druid spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

#### Level 1: Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the Speak with Animals spell prepared.

You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can't decipher it without magic.

#### Level 1: Primal Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

**Magician.** You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

**Warden.** You gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.

#### Level 2: Wild Shape

The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see "Known Forms" below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also end Wild Shape early as a Bonus Action.

**Number of Uses.** You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.

**Known Forms.** You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see appendix B for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible Beast form.

When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.

##### Beast Shapes

| Druid Level | Known Forms | Max. CR | Fly Speed |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 2 | 4 | 1/4 | No |
| 4 | 6 | 1/2 | No |
| 8 | 8 | 1 | Yes |

**Rules While Shape-Shifted.** While in a Wild Shape form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:

**Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.

**Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.

**No Spellcasting.** You can't cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.

**Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.

#### Level 2: Wild Companion

You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the Find Familiar spell without Material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 3: Druid Subclass

You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle of the Land subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Druid level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Wild Resurgence

Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can use it one more time by expending a spell slot (no action required).

In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself Advantage on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

#### Level 7: Elemental Fury

The might of the elements flows through you. When you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.

In addition, whenever you assume a Wild Shape form, choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. While in that form, you have Resistance to the chosen damage type, and when you deal damage with an Unarmed Strike using the form, you deal an extra 1d6 damage of that type.

#### Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury

While in a Wild Shape form, you gain the Elemental Fury benefit for two of that feature's damage types rather than one. And whenever you deal the extra damage from that feature, the extra damage increases by 1d6.

#### Level 18: Beast Spells

While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in your Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component requiring a Cost or that consumes its Material component.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.

#### Level 20: Archdruid

The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.

**Evergreen Wild Shape.** Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain all expended uses of it.

**Nature Magician.** You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

**Longevity.** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.

### Druid Subclass: Circle of the Land

#### Harness the Magic of Primeval Forests

The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of their communities.

#### Level 3: Circle Spells

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one type of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. The spells associated with that land are thereafter always prepared for you, as shown in the Circle of the Land Spells table. Consult the descriptions of those spells to see example environments for each land type.

##### Circle of the Land Spells

| Druid Level | Arid | Polar | Temperate | Tropical |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 3 | Blur, Burning Hands, Fire Bolt | Dancing Lights, Hold Person, Ray of Frost | Misty Step, Shocking Grasp, Sleep | Acid Splash, Ray of Sickness, Web |
| 5 | Conjure Minor Elementals, Fireball | Conjure Minor Elementals, Sleet Storm | Call Lightning, Lightning Bolt | Insect Plague, Stinking Cloud |
| 7 | Blight, Wall of Fire | Freedom of Movement, Ice Storm | Freedom of Movement, Grasping Vine | Divination, Polymorph |
| 9 | Conjure Elemental, Flame Strike | Commune with Nature, Cone of Cold | Commune with Nature, Tree Stride | Conjure Elemental, Insect Plague |

#### Level 3: Land's Aid

As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and grasping vines appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be Restrained for 1 minute. A Restrained creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

In addition, you or one ally of your choice that you can see in the Sphere regains 2d6 Hit Points. The number of Hit Points regained increases by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).

#### Level 6: Natural Recovery

When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you're a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels' worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 10: Nature's Ward

You are immune to poison damage and the Poisoned condition, and you have Immunity to being Charmed or Frightened by Elementals or Fey.

#### Level 14: Nature's Sanctuary

As a Magic action, you can give yourself Sanctuary for 1 minute. While you have it, beasts and plants have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and when a beast or plant hits you with an attack roll, that creature takes Radiant damage equal to your Druid level.

Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

#### Level 1: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see "Feats"). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

**Unarmed Fighting.** When you hit with your Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a Shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 Bludgeoning damage to one creature Grappled by you.

#### Level 1: Second Wind

You have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action, you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second Wind column of the Fighter Features table.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Fighter Features table.

#### Level 2: Action Surge

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the Magic action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a Short or Long Rest before you can use it again. Starting at Fighter level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.

#### Level 2: Tactical Mind

You have a mind for tactics and getting the upper hand on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn't expended.

#### Level 3: Fighter Subclass

You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The Champion subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Fighter level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Fighter levels 8, 12, 14, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Tactical Shift

Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

#### Level 9: Indomitable

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

You can use this feature twice between Long Rests starting at level 13 and three times between Long Rests starting at level 17.

#### Level 9: Tactical Master

When you attack with a weapon whose mastery property you can use, you can replace that property with the Push or Sap property for that attack.

#### Level 11: Two Extra Attacks

You can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Level 13: Studied Attacks

You study a foe to exploit an opening. If you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can also deal damage to a second creature within 5 feet of the first. The second creature takes damage of the same type equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can do this only once per turn.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Combat Prowess is recommended.

#### Level 20: Three Extra Attacks

You can attack four times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

- Simple Melee weapons
- Martial Melee weapons that have the Light property

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield.

**Bonus Unarmed Strike.** You can make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.

**Martial Arts Die.** You can roll 1d6 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike or Monk weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk Features table.

**Dexterous Attacks.** You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes and Monk weapons. In addition, when you choose the Grapple or Shove option, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine the save DC.

#### Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren't wearing any armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.

#### Level 2: Monk's Focus

Your martial training allows you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. You have 2 Focus Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Monk Features table.

You can expend these points to fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more Monk features that use Focus Points as you gain levels in this class.

When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended Focus Points.

Some features that use Focus Points require your target to make a saving throw. The DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus.

**Flurry of Blows.** You can expend 1 Focus Point to make two Unarmed Strikes as a Bonus Action.

**Patient Defense.** You can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage and the Dodge actions as a Bonus Action.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack's force. If you do so, choose a creature within 5 feet of you if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn't behind Total Cover if the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.

Whenever you deal damage with your Unarmed Strike, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.

#### Level 7: Evasion

The vibrations are harmless unless you take an action to end them. Alternatively, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of the attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly (no action required).
