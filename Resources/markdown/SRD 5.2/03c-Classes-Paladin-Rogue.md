| 20 | +6 | Subclass feature | 3 | 15 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |

#### Level 1: Lay On Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class's description.

**Spell Slots.** The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. Heroism and Searing Smite are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

#### Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see "Feats" for feats). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

**Blessed Warrior.** You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (see the Cleric class's section for a list of Cleric spells). Guidance and Sacred Flame are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.

#### Level 2: Paladin's Smite

You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.

#### Level 3: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.

You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.

**Divine Sense.** As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.

#### Level 3: Paladin Subclass

You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Paladin level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Faithful Steed

You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the Find Steed spell prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare.

You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 6: Aura of Protection

You radiate a protective, invisible aura in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition.

You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.

#### Level 9: Abjure Foes

As a Magic action, you can expend one use of this class's Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can do only one of the following on its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.

#### Level 10: Aura of Courage

You and your allies in your Aura of Protection have Immunity to the Frightened condition.

#### Level 11: Radiant Strikes

Your strikes carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.

#### Level 14: Restoring Touch

When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool for each of these conditions you remove; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### Level 18: Aura Expansion

Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Truesight is recommended.

> **Breaking Your Oath**
>
> A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.
>
> A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.
>
> If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your GM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.

---

### Paladin Subclass: Oath of Devotion

*Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order*

The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals of justice and order. These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some—”for better or worse—”hold the rest of the world to the same standards.

#### Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3 | Protection from Evil and Good, Shield of Faith |
| 5 | Aid, Zone of Truth |
| 9 | Beacon of Hope, Dispel Magic |
| 13 | Freedom of Movement, Guardian of Faith |
| 17 | Commune, Flame Strike |

#### Level 3: Sacred Weapon

When you take the Attack action, you can expend one use of this class's Channel Divinity to imbue one Melee weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (minimum bonus of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.

The weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.

You can end this effect early (no action required). This effect also ends if you aren't carrying the weapon.

#### Level 7: Aura of Devotion

You and your allies in your Aura of Protection have Immunity to the Charmed condition.

#### Level 15: Smite of Protection

Your magical might defends your allies. Immediately after you cast Divine Smite, you can expend 1 spell slot to give yourself and allies within 30 feet of you the benefits of the Protection from Evil and Good spell for 10 minutes. This use doesn't require Concentration, but the effect ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition.

#### Level 20: Holy Nimbus

As a Bonus Action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you end it (no action required). You emit Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light 30 feet beyond that. Whenever an enemy starts its turn in the Bright Light, it takes 10 Radiant damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in the Ranger spell list later in the class's description.

#### Level 1: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Sleight of Hand and Stealth are recommended if you have proficiency in them.

At Rogue level 6, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### Level 1: Sneak Attack

You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal extra damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you're attacking with a Finesse or Ranged weapon and if at least one of the following requirements is met:

**Advantage.** You have Advantage on the attack roll.

**Ally Adjacent to Target.** At least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn't have the Incapacitated condition, and you don't have Disadvantage on the attack roll.

The extra damage equals a number of d6s equal to half your Rogue level (round up), as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Features table.

#### Level 1: Thieves' Cant

You picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves' Cant and one other language of your choice, which you choose from the language tables in "Character Creation."

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Daggers and Shortbows.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Shortswords and Darts.

#### Level 2: Cunning Action

Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: Dash, Disengage, or Hide.

#### Level 3: Rogue Subclass

You gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. The Thief subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Rogue level or lower.

#### Level 3: Steady Aim

As a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Rogue levels 8, 10, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Cunning Strike

You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack's damage before rolling.

If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

**Poison (Cost: 1d6).** You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The Poisoned creature can't take Reactions.

**Trip (Cost: 1d6).** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.

**Withdraw (Cost: 1d6).** Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

#### Level 5: Uncanny Dodge

When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack's damage against you (round down).

#### Level 7: Evasion

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you're subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can't use this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.

#### Level 7: Reliable Talent

Whenever you make an ability check that uses one of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

#### Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike

You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost for each effect.

#### Level 14: Devious Strikes

You've practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.

**Daze (Cost: 2d6).** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.

**Knock Out (Cost: 6d6).** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Obscure (Cost: 3d6).** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.

#### Level 15: Slippery Mind

Your cunning mind is exceptionally hard to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.

#### Level 18: Elusive

You're so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have Advantage against you unless you have the Incapacitated condition.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the Night Spirit is recommended.

#### Level 20: Stroke of Luck

You have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a D20 Test, you can turn the roll into a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

### Rogue Subclass: Thief

*A Classic Scoundrel*

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this subclass, but so do Rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, dungeon delvers, and investigators.

#### Level 3: Fast Hands

You have additional options for the Bonus Action of your Cunning Action, as detailed below.

**Sleight of Hand.** You can use the Sleight of Hand skill to pick pockets, disarm traps, or perform similar feats of manual dexterity.

**Use an Object.** You can take the Utilize action, or you can take the Magic action to activate a magic item that requires that action.

#### Level 3: Second-Story Work

You've trained to get into places others would have trouble reaching. You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed, and when you take the Jump action, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

#### Level 9: Supreme Sneak

You gain the following benefits.

**Invisibility.** You can cast Invisibility on yourself, requiring no spell slot or spell components. Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't cast it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

**Infiltration.** If you have the Hide action's Invisible condition, you can move up to your Speed without ending that condition if you end the move within Cover or Heavily Obscured. This movement doesn't apply if you were detected before the move.

#### Level 13: Use Magic Device

In your treasure hunting, you have learned how to maximize the use of magic items. You ignore all class, species, and level requirements for attuning to and using magic items.

#### Level 17: Thief's Reflexes

You have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal Initiative and your second turn at your Initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you're surprised.
