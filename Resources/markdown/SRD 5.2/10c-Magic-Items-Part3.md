# Magic Items (Part 3)

**Might of Giants.** The Strength score bestowed by your Belt of Giant Strength or Gauntlets of Ogre Power increases by 4, to a maximum of 30.

### Handy Haversack
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet. The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.

Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.

If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an Artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again.

Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

### Hat of Disguise
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this hat, you can cast the Disguise Self spell. The spell ends if the hat is removed.

### Headband of Intellect
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

Your Intelligence is 19 while you wear this headband. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is 19 or higher without it.

### Helm of Brilliance
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.

You gain the following benefits while wearing the helm.

**Diamond Light.** As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits a 30-foot Emanation. When at least one Undead is within that area, the Emanation is filled with Dim Light. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 Radiant damage.

**Fire Opal Flames.** As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can take a Magic action to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 Fire damage. The flames last until you take a Bonus Action to extinguish them or until you drop or stow the weapon.

**Ruby Resistance.** As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have Resistance to Fire damage.

**Spells.** You can cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: Daylight (opal), Fireball (fire opal), Prismatic Spray (diamond), or Wall of Fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.

**Taking Fire Damage.** Roll 1d20 if you are wearing the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems and is then destroyed. Each creature within a 60-foot Emanation originating from you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking Radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm.

### Helm of Comprehending Languages
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

While wearing this helm, you can cast Comprehend Languages from it.

### Helm of Telepathy
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this helm, you have telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and you can cast Detect Thoughts or Suggestion (save DC 13) from the helm. Once either spell is cast from the helm, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.

### Helm of Teleportation
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast Teleport from it. The helm regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

### Holy Avenger
*Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Paladin)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 Radiant damage.

While you hold the drawn weapon, it creates a 10-foot Emanation originating from you. You and all creatures Friendly to you in the Emanation have Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the Paladin class, the size of the Emanation increases to 30 feet.

### Horn of Blasting
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

You can take a Magic action to blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot Cone that is audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the Cone makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 Thunder damage and has the Deafened condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the Cone that aren't being worn or carried take 10d8 Thunder damage.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 Force damage to the user and destroys the horn.

### Horn of Valhalla
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Silver or Brass), Very Rare (Bronze), or Legendary (Iron)*

You can take a Magic action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the Berserker stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of Horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many spirits it summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly by rolling on the following table.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned spirits attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are Friendly to you and your allies and follow your commands.

| 1d100 | Horn Type | Spirits | Requirement |
|:------|:----------|:--------|:------------|
| 01–40 | Silver | 2 | None |
| 41–75 | Brass | 3 | Proficiency with all Simple weapons |
| 76–90 | Bronze | 4 | Training with all Medium armor |
| 91–00 | Iron | 5 | Proficiency with all Martial weapons |

### Horseshoes of a Zephyr
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a Magic action.

While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above a surface. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores Difficult Terrain. In addition, the creature can travel for up to 12 hours a day without gaining Exhaustion levels from extended travel.

### Horseshoes of Speed
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a Magic action.

While all four horseshoes are attached to the same creature, its Speed is increased by 30 feet.

### Immovable Rod
*Rod, Uncommon*

This iron rod has a button on one end. You can take a Utilize action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature takes a Utilize action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it defies gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can take a Utilize action to make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a successful check.

### Instant Fortress
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

As a Magic action, you can place this 1-inch adamantine statuette on the ground and, using a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a square adamantine tower. Repeating the command word causes the tower to revert to statuette form, which works only if the tower is empty. Each creature in the area where the tower appears is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried are also pushed clear of the tower.

The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder, staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting them. This ladder, staircase, or ramp ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When created, the tower has a single door at ground level on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the Knock spell and similar magic.

Magic prevents the tower from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20; HP 100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage except that which is dealt by siege equipment; and Resistance to all other damage. Shrinking the tower back down to statuette form doesn't repair damage to the tower. Only a Wish spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of level 8 or lower). Each casting of Wish causes the tower to regain all its Hit Points.

### Ioun Stone
*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)*

Roughly marble sized, Ioun Stones are named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun Stones exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.

When you take a Magic action to toss an Ioun Stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you while doing so. You can have up to three Ioun Stones orbiting your head at the same time.

Each Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone avoids contact with other creatures and objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.

As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it's orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had dropped it.

The type of stone determines its rarity and effects.

**Absorption (Very Rare).** While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic.

**Agility (Very Rare).** Your Dexterity increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep-red sphere orbits your head.

**Awareness (Rare).** While this dark-blue rhomboid orbits your head, you have Advantage on Initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.

**Fortitude (Very Rare).** Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.

**Greater Absorption (Legendary).** While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 8 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic.

**Insight (Very Rare).** Your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.

**Intellect (Very Rare).** Your Intelligence increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.

**Leadership (Very Rare).** Your Charisma increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.

**Mastery (Legendary).** Your Proficiency Bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.

**Protection (Rare).** You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class while this dusty-rose prism orbits your head.

**Regeneration (Legendary).** You regain 15 Hit Points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head if you have at least 1 Hit Point.

**Reserve (Rare).** This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4 into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

**Strength (Very Rare).** Your Strength increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.

**Sustenance (Rare).** You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.

### Iron Bands
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a command that releases it. Doing so or missing with the attack causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature that can touch the bands, including the one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands. On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Iron Flask
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

While holding this brass-stoppered iron flask, you can take a Magic action to target a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask is empty and the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't age and doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink.

You can take a Magic action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature in the flask. The creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour, understanding those commands even if it doesn't know the language in which the commands are given. If you issue no commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its death or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.

An Identify spell reveals if the flask contains a creature, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered Iron Flask might already contain a creature chosen by the GM.

### Javelin of Lightning
*Weapon (Javelin), Uncommon*

Each time you make an attack roll with this magic weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning damage instead of Piercing damage.

**Lightning Bolt.** When you throw this weapon at a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms a 5-foot-wide Line between you and the target. The target and each other creature in the Line (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in your hand. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Lantern of Revealing
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's Bright Light. You can take a Utilize action to lower the hood, reducing the lantern's light to Dim Light in a 5-foot radius.

### Luck Blade
*Weapon (Glaive, Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar, Sickle, or Shortsword), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the weapon is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.

**Luck.** If the weapon is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one failed D20 Test if you don't have the Incapacitated condition. You must use the second roll. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Wish.** The weapon has 1d3 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge and cast Wish from it. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. The weapon loses this property if it has no charges.

### Mace of Disruption
*Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 Radiant damage. If the target has 25 Hit Points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature has the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn.

**Light.** While you hold this weapon, it sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.

### Mace of Smiting
*Weapon (Mace), Rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the weapon to attack a Construct.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 7 Bludgeoning damage, or 14 Bludgeoning damage if it's a Construct. If a Construct has 25 Hit Points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.

### Mace of Terror
*Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the weapon, you can take a Magic action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While Frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't make Opportunity Attacks. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Mantle of Spell Resistance
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You have Advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.

### Manual of Bodily Health
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

This book contains health and nutrition tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a century.

### Manual of Gainful Exercise
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

This book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a century.

### Manual of Golems
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly by rolling on the accompanying table. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two level 5 spell slots. A creature that can't use a Manual of Golems and attempts to read it takes 6d6 Psychic damage.

To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.

Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. See "Monsters" for the golem's stat block. The golem is under your control, and it understands and obeys your commands.

| 1d20 | Golem | Time | Cost |
|:-----|:------|:-----|:-----|
| 1–5 | Clay Golem | 30 days | 65,000 GP |
| 6–17 | Flesh Golem | 60 days | 50,000 GP |
| 18 | Iron Golem | 120 days | 100,000 GP |
| 19–20 | Stone Golem | 90 days | 80,000 GP |

### Manual of Quickness of Action
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a century.

### Marvelous Pigments
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total).

Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube. The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you leave the Cube before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.

When the work is done, all the painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within the 20-foot Cube.

No object created by a pot of pigment can have a value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all objects created by a pot of pigment can't exceed 500 GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close inspection reveals they're made from paste, cookies, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm.

### Medallion of Thoughts
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

The medallion has 5 charges. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast Detect Thoughts (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

### Mirror of Life Trapping
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it.

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror's nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.

While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate.

In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.

Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

### Mithral Armor
*Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor), Uncommon*

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Armor made of this substance can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.

### Mysterious Deck
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the Mysterious Deck table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.

Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)

Each card's effect is described below.

**Balance.** You can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You can't decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect.

**Comet.** The next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 Hit Points or you don't choose a foe, this card has no effect.

**Donjon.** You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you're wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.

**Euryale.** The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.

**Fates.** Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

**Flames.** A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.

**Fool.** You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn't count as one of your declared draws.

**Gem.** Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet.

**Jester.** You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

**Key.** A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The GM chooses the weapon.

**Knight.** You gain the service of a Knight, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your GM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The GM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.

**Moon.** You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.

**Puzzle.** Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

**Rogue.** An NPC of the GM's choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don't know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.

**Ruin.** All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.

**Sage.** At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.

**Skull.** An Avatar of Death (see the accompanying stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can't be restored to life.

**Star.** Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.

**Sun.** A magic item (chosen by the GM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit Points daily at dawn until you die.

**Talons.** Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.

**Throne.** You gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.

**Void.** Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A Wish spell can't return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.

### Necklace of Adaptation
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have Advantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the Poisoned condition.

### Necklace of Fireballs
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can take a Magic action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 Fireball (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the damage of the Fireball by 1d6 for each bead after the first (maximum 12d6).

### Necklace of Prayer Beads
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Cleric, Druid, or Paladin)*

This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.

Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a Bonus Action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.

| 1d20 | Bead | Spell |

### Nine Lives Stealer
*Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

**Life Stealing.** The weapon has 1d8 + 1 charges. When you attack a creature that has fewer than 100 Hit Points with this weapon and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body. Constructs and Undead succeed on the save automatically. The weapon loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the weapon has no charges remaining, it loses this property.

### Oathbow
*Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can utter or sign the following command words: "Swift death to you who have wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.

When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have Advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from Half Cover or Three-Quarters Cover, and you suffer no Disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 Piercing damage.

While your sworn enemy lives, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.

### Oil of Etherealness
*Potion, Rare*

One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the Etherealness spell for 1 hour.

Beads of this cloudy, gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate.

### Oil of Sharpness
*Potion, Very Rare*

One vial of this oil can coat one Melee weapon or twenty pieces of ammunition, but only ammunition and Melee weapons that are nonmagical and deal Slashing or Piercing damage are affected. Applying the oil takes 1 minute, after which the oil magically seeps into whatever it coats, turning the coated weapon into a +3 Weapon or the coated ammunition into +3 Ammunition.

This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver shards.

### Oil of Slipperiness
*Potion, Uncommon*

One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the Freedom of Movement spell for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as a Magic action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the Grease spell in that area for 8 hours.

This sticky, black unguent is thick and heavy, but it flows quickly when poured.

### Pearl of Power
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

While this pearl is on your person, you can take a Magic action to regain one expended spell slot of level 3 or lower. Once you use the pearl, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Periapt of Health
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this pendant, you can take a Magic action to regain 2d4 + 2 Hit Points. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

In addition, you have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Poisoned condition while you wear this pendant.

### Periapt of Proof against Poison
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, you have Immunity to the Poisoned condition and Poison damage.

### Periapt of Wound Closure
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this pendant, you gain the following benefits.

**Life Preservation.** Whenever you make a Death Saving Throw, you can change a roll of 9 or lower to a 10, turning a failed save into a successful one.

**Natural Healing Boost.** Whenever you roll a Hit Point Die to regain Hit Points, double the number of Hit Points it restores.
