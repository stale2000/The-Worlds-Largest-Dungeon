#### Level 1: Rage

You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.

You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.

**Damage Resistance.** You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

**Rage Damage.** When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

**Strength Advantage.** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

**No Concentration or Spells.** You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.

**Duration.** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:
- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
- Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

#### Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.

#### Level 2: Danger Sense

You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.

#### Level 2: Reckless Attack

You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with greater power. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.

#### Level 3: Barbarian Subclass

You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.

#### Level 3: Primal Knowledge

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.

In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility and senses.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Fast Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor.

#### Level 7: Feral Instinct

Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.

#### Level 7: Instinctive Pounce

As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can Move up to half your Speed.

#### Level 9: Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

**Forceful Blow.** The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then Move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

**Hamstring Blow.** The target's Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—”the most recent one.

#### Level 11: Relentless Rage

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.

#### Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. You can also use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.

#### Level 15: Persistent Rage

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.

#### Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 3d10.

#### Level 18: Indomitable Might

If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.

#### Level 20: Primal Champion

You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

### Barbarian Subclass: Path of the Berserker

#### Walk the Path of Fury

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them.

#### Level 3: Frenzy

If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or Unarmed Strike used for the attack.

#### Level 6: Mindless Rage

You have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions while your Rage is active. If you're Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage, the condition ends on you.

#### Level 10: Retaliation

When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.

#### Level 14: Intimidating Presence

As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others with your menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know two Bard cantrips of your choice. Light and Vicious Mockery are recommended. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Bard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Bard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 Bard spells. Cure Wounds, Dissonant Whispers, Healing Word, and Thunderwave are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Bard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six Bard spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Bard spells for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

#### Level 1: Bardic Inspiration

You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

**Using Bardic Inspiration.** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can hear or see you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.

**Number of Uses.** A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time, and you can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table.

#### Level 2: Expertise

You gain Expertise (see "Glossary") in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them.

#### Level 2: Jack of All Trades

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn't otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

#### Level 3: Bard Subclass

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College of Lore subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Bard level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Font of Inspiration

You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

In addition, if a creature rolls a Bardic Inspiration die from you, and the roll fails to turn the creature's D20 Test into a success, the creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die.

#### Level 7: Countercharm

You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.

#### Level 9: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### Level 10: Magical Secrets

You've learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of the additional spells from the Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists. A chosen spell counts as a Bard spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of Bard spells you know.

In addition, you can replace one spell from this feature with one from those same spell lists whenever you replace a Bard spell you have prepared.

#### Level 18: Superior Inspiration

When you roll Initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain two expended uses of it.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.

#### Level 20: Words of Creation

You have mastered the Words of Creation, the language of the multiverse. When you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you can also give them the effect of Guidance at the same time without expending a spell slot, provided you have that spell prepared. That creature can benefit from both the Bardic Inspiration die and Guidance on the same D20 Test.

In addition, you always have the Mass Heal spell prepared, and when you cast that spell, you can target a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) without expending a spell slot. Once you cast Mass Heal in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

### Bard Subclass: College of Lore

#### Pursue Secrets and Lore

Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these Bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. And when the applause dies down, audience members might find themselves questioning their basic assumptions about some subjects or their understanding of important events.

The loyalty of these Bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following a religious tenet. A noble who keeps such a Bard as a herald or advisor knows that the Bard would rather be honest than politic.

The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

#### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

#### Level 3: Cutting Words

You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself succeeds on a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll a Bardic Inspiration die and subtract the number rolled from the creature's roll, reducing the roll's total by that amount and potentially turning it into a failure.

You can use this Reaction after the creature rolls but before the DM determines whether the D20 Test succeeds or fails.

#### Level 6: Cunning Inspiration

When a creature rolls one of your Bardic Inspiration dice and gets a 1, it can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

#### Level 6: Magical Discoveries

You learn two spells of your choice from the Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown in the Bard Features table, or a cantrip.

You always have the chosen spells prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of these spells with another eligible spell.

#### Level 14: Peerless Skill

When you make a D20 Test, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to your roll's total. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast spells. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear in the Cleric spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know three Cleric cantrips of your choice. Guidance, Sacred Flame, and Thaumaturgy are recommended. Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Cleric cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another Cleric cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 Cleric spells. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Cleric spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

#### Level 1: Divine Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

**Protector.** You gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.

**Thaumaturge.** You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

#### Level 2: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from among those you know to create. You gain additional effect options at certain Cleric levels.

You can use your Channel Divinity a number of times equal to the number in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from your Spellcasting feature.

**Divine Spark.** As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or deal Radiant damage to it equal to that total (your choice).

You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).

**Turn Undead.** As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.

#### Level 3: Cleric Subclass

You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life Domain subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Cleric level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Sear Undead

Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll's total.

#### Level 7: Blessed Strikes

Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass, use this feature to choose the other option).

**Divine Strike.** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) to the target.

**Potent Spellcasting.** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.

#### Level 10: Divine Intervention

You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn't require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can't use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes

The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.

**Divine Strike.** The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.

**Potent Spellcasting.** When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or an ally within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.

#### Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention

You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose Wish, allowing you to cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. If you do so, you can't use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.

### Cleric Subclass: Life Domain

#### Preserve Life and Embody Light

The Life Domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy that sustains all life. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.

Some deities of life promote the creation and renewal of life, and clerics of those gods cherish all living things. Other deities of life are closely associated with their people—”the community or an ancestry—”and their clerics preserve the life of those peoples, often opposing the gods and clerics who oversee death for the same peoples.

Deities of life include Lathander, Mishakal, and Yondalla.

#### Level 3: Disciple of Life

Your healing spells are divinely empowered. Whenever a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot's level.

#### Level 3: Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Life Domain Spells

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3 | Aid, Lesser Restoration, Revivify |
| 5 | Aura of Life, Death Ward |
| 7 | Greater Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds |
| 9 | Power Word Heal, Sunburst |

#### Level 6: Preserve Life

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum.

#### Level 17: Supreme Healing

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don't roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12.

### Cleric Spell List

This section presents the Cleric spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell's school of magic is listed. In the Special column, **C** means the spell requires Concentration, **R** means it's a Ritual, and **M** means it requires a specific Material component.
