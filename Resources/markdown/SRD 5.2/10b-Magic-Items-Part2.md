# Magic Items (Part 2)

### Boots of Striding and Springing
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While you wear these boots, your Speed becomes 30 feet unless your Speed is higher, and your Speed isn't reduced by you carrying weight in excess of your carrying capacity or wearing Heavy Armor.

Once on each of your turns, you can jump up to 30 feet by spending only 10 feet of movement.

### Boots of the Winterlands

### Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

While this bowl is filled with water and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action to summon a Water Elemental. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the bowl as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It holds about 3 gallons.

### Bracers of Archery

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

While you are within 5 feet of this brazier, you can take a Magic action to summon a Fire Elemental. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the brazier as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

### Brooch of Shielding
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this brooch, you have Resistance to Force damage, and you have Immunity to damage from the Magic Missile spell.

### Broom of Flying
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

This wooden broom functions like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and take a Magic action to make it hover beneath you, at which time it can be ridden in the air. It has a Fly Speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its Fly Speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land or when you're no longer riding it.

As a Magic action, you can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you name the location and are familiar with it. The broom comes back to you when you take a Magic action and use a command word if the broom is still within 1 mile of you.

### Candle of Invocation
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a Magic action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have Advantage on D20 Tests. In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast Gate with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the GM or determined by rolling on the following table.

| 1d100 | Outer Plane | 1d100 | Outer Plane |
|:------|:------------|:------|:------------|

### Cape of the Mountebank
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast Dimension Door as a Magic action. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke. The space you left is Lightly Obscured by that smoke until the end of your next turn.

### Carpet of Flying
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

You can make this carpet hover and fly by taking a Magic action and using the carpet's command word. It moves according to your directions if you are within 30 feet of it.

Four sizes of Carpet of Flying exist. The GM chooses the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly by rolling on the following table. A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but its Fly Speed is halved if it carries more than its normal capacity.

| 1d100 | Size | Capacity | Fly Speed |
|:------|:-----|:---------|:----------|
| 01–20 | 3 ft. × 5 ft. | 200 lb. | 80 feet |

### Censer of Controlling Air Elementals
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

While gently swinging this censer, you can take a Magic action to summon an Air Elemental. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the censer as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The censer can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

### Chime of Opening
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. As a Magic action, you can strike the chime to cast Knock. The spell's customary knocking sound is replaced by the clear, ringing tone of the chime, which is audible out to 300 feet.

The chime can be used 10 times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless.

### Circlet of Blasting
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

While wearing this circlet, you can cast Scorching Ray with it (+5 to hit). The circlet can't cast this spell again until the next dawn.

### Cloak of Arachnida
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint, silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

**Poison Resistance.** You have Resistance to Poison damage.

**Spider Climb.** You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed and can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

**Spider Walk.** You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were Difficult Terrain.

**Web.** You can cast Web (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Cloak of Displacement
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While you wear this cloak, it magically projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while your Speed is 0.

### Cloak of Elvenkind
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While you wear this cloak, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive you have Disadvantage, and you have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

### Cloak of Protection
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws while you wear this cloak.

### Cloak of the Bat
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this cloak, you have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In an area of Dim Light or Darkness, you can grip the edges of the cloak and use it to gain a Fly Speed of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in Dim Light or Darkness, you lose this Fly Speed.

While wearing the cloak in an area of Dim Light or Darkness, you can cast Polymorph on yourself, shape-shifting into a Bat. While in that form, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

### Cloak of the Manta Ray

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast Scrying (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can cast Detect Thoughts (save DC 17) targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this Detect Thoughts spell to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if the Scrying spell ends.

### Crystal Ball of Telepathy
*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast Scrying (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also cast Suggestion (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures.

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast Scrying (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you have Truesight with a range of 120 feet centered on the spell's sensor.

### Cube of Force
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it. You can press one of those faces, expend the number of charges required for it, and thereby cast the spell associated with it (save DC 17), as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table.

The cube starts with 10 charges, and it regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Cube of Force Faces**

| Spell | Charge Cost |
|:------|:------------|
| Mage Armor | 1 |
| Shield | 1 |
| Tiny Hut | 3 |
| Private Sanctum | 4 |
| Resilient Sphere | 4 |
| Wall of Force | 5 |

### Cubic Gate
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.

The cube has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. As a Magic action, you can expend 1 of the cube's charges to cast one of the following spells using the cube.

**Gate.** Pressing one side of the cube, you cast Gate, opening a portal to the plane of existence keyed to that side.

**Plane Shift.** Pressing one side of the cube twice, you cast Plane Shift, transporting the targets to the plane of existence keyed to that side.

### Dagger of Venom
*Weapon (Dagger), Rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can take a Bonus Action to magically coat the blade with poison. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 Poison damage and have the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. The weapon can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

### Dancing Sword
*Weapon (Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar, or Shortsword), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You can take a Bonus Action to toss this magic weapon into the air. When you do so, the weapon begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of itself. The weapon uses your attack roll and adds your ability modifier to damage rolls.

While the weapon hovers, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same Bonus Action, you can cause the weapon to attack one creature within 5 feet of the weapon.

After the hovering weapon attacks for the fourth time, it flies back to you and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, the weapon falls to the ground in your space. If the weapon has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or are more than 30 feet away from it.

### Decanter of Endless Water
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.

You can take a Magic action to remove the stopper and issue one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following command words:

**Splash.** The decanter produces 1 gallon of water.

**Fountain.** The decanter produces 5 gallons of water.

**Geyser.** The decanter produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a Line 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. If you're holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser in one direction (no action required). One creature of your choice in the Line must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone condition. Instead of a creature, you can target one object in the Line that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is knocked over by the geyser.

### Deck of Illusions
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34 cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.

Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel Magic spell or a similar effect). When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

### Defender
*Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The first time you attack with the weapon on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the weapon's bonus to your Armor Class. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack rolls and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it.

### Demon Armor
*Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and you know Abyssal. In addition, the armor's clawed gauntlets allow your Unarmed Strikes to deal 1d8 Slashing damage instead of the usual Bludgeoning damage, and you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes.

**Curse.** Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.

### Dimensional Shackles
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

You can take a Utilize action to place these shackles on a creature that has the Incapacitated condition. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.

You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can take a Utilize action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.

### Dragon Orb
*Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.

While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic action to peer into the orb's depths. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the Charmed condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it.

While you are Charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.

**Spells.** The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

| Spell | Charge Cost |
|:------|:------------|
| Cure Wounds (level 9 version) | 4 |
| Daylight | 1 |
| Death Ward | 2 |
| Detect Magic | 0 |
| Scrying (save DC 18) | 3 |

**Call Dragons.** While you control the orb, you can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.

**Destroying an Orb.** A Dragon Orb has AC 20 and is destroyed if it takes damage from a +3 Weapon or a Disintegrate spell. Nothing else can harm it.

### Dragon Scale Mail
*Armor (Scale Mail), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

Dragon Scale Mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them. Other times, hunters carefully preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, Dragon Scale Mail is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class, you have Advantage on saving throws against the breath weapons of Dragons, and you have Resistance to one damage type determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the accompanying table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as a Magic action to discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of yourself that is of the same type as the armor. This action can't be used again until the next dawn.

| Dragon | Resistance | Dragon | Resistance |
|:-------|:-----------|:-------|:-----------|
| Black | Acid | Gold | Fire |
| Blue | Lightning | Green | Poison |
| Brass | Fire | Red | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning | Silver | Cold |
| Copper | Acid | White | Cold |

### Dragon Slayer
*Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon's type if the target is a Dragon.

### Dust of Disappearance
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This powder resembles fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you take a Utilize action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within a 10-foot Emanation originating from you have the Invisible condition for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. Immediately after an affected creature makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell, the Invisible condition ends for that creature.

### Dust of Dryness
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot Cube of water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. A creature can take a Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.

As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Elemental). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Dust of Sneezing and Choking
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

Found in a small container, this powder resembles Dust of Disappearance, and Identify reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

As a Utilize action, you can throw the dust into the air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals, Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save automatically.

On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing uncontrollably; it has the Incapacitated condition and is suffocating. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends on any creature targeted by a Lesser Restoration spell.

### Dwarven Plate
*Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Very Rare*

While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class. In addition, if an effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can take a Reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.

### Dwarven Thrower
*Weapon (Warhammer), Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Dwarf or a Creature Attuned to a Belt of Dwarvenkind)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the Thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is a Giant. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.

### Efficient Quiver
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to 60 Arrows, Bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to 18 Javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long objects, such as bows, Quarterstaffs, or Spears.

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.

### Efreeti Bottle
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

When you take a Magic action to remove the stopper of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of it. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an Efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls on the following table to determine what happens.

| 1d10 | Effect |
|:-----|:-------|
| 1 | The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 2–9 | The efreeti understands your languages and obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 10 | The efreeti understands your languages and can cast Wish once for you. It disappears when it grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic. |

### Elemental Gem
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you take a Utilize action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned (see "Monsters" for its stat block), and the gem ceases to be magical. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the broken gem as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The type of gem determines the elemental, as shown in the following table.

| Gem | Summoned Elemental |
|:----|:-------------------|
| Blue sapphire | Air Elemental |
| Emerald | Water Elemental |
| Red corundum | Fire Elemental |
| Yellow diamond | Earth Elemental |

### Elven Chain
*Armor (Chain Mail or Chain Shirt), Rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class while you wear this armor. You are considered trained with this armor even if you lack training with Medium or Heavy armor.

### Eversmoking Bottle
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

As a Magic action, you can open or close this bottle.

Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot Emanation originating from the bottle. The area within the smoke is Heavily Obscured.

Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of the Emanation increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum size of 120 feet.

Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes. A strong wind (such as that created by the Gust of Wind spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.

### Eyes of Charming
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 or more charges to cast Charm Person (save DC 13). For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the spell. You increase the spell's level by one for each additional charge you expend. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

### Eyes of Minute Seeing
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, your vision improves significantly out to a range of 1 foot, granting you Darkvision within that range and Advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to examine something within that range.

### Eyes of the Eagle
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.

### Feather Token
*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies*

This object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens table. The type of token determines its rarity.

**Anchor (Uncommon).** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.

**Bird (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can't attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as a Magic action.

**Fan (Uncommon).** If you are on a boat or ship, you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.

**Swan Boat (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take a Magic action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as a Magic action.

**Tree (Uncommon).** You must be outdoors to use this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence.

**Whip (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place.

As a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the Incapacitated condition.

### Figurine of Wondrous Power
*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies*

A Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.

**Bronze Griffon (Rare).** This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a Griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

**Ebony Fly (Rare).** This ebony statuette, carved in the likeness of a horsefly, can become a Giant Fly (see the accompanying stat block) for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

**Golden Lions (Rare).** These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a Lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

**Ivory Goats (Rare).** These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

**Goat of Terror.** This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 Lance, and the other becomes a +2 Longsword. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

**Goat of Traveling.** This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.

**Goat of Travail.** This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

**Marble Elephant (Rare).** This marble statuette resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an Elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

**Obsidian Steed (Very Rare).** This polished obsidian horse can become a Nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

The figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.

**Onyx Dog (Rare).** This onyx statuette of a dog can become a Mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has Blindsight with a range of 60 feet. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

**Serpentine Owl (Rare).** This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a Giant Owl for up to 8 hours. The owl can communicate telepathically with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

**Silver Raven (Uncommon).** This silver statuette of a raven can become a Raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine grants you the ability to cast Animal Messenger on it.

### Flame Tongue
*Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While holding this magic weapon, you can take a Bonus Action and use a command word to cause flames to engulf the damage-dealing part of the weapon. These flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet. While the weapon is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit. The flames last until you take a Bonus Action to issue the command again or until you drop, stow, or sheathe the weapon.

### Folding Boat
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring a Magic action to use:

**First Command Word.** The box unfolds into a Rowboat.

**Second Command Word.** The box unfolds into a Keelboat.

**Third Command Word.** The Folding Boat folds back into a box if no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.

Statistics for the Rowboat and Keelboat appear in "Equipment." If either vessel is reduced to 0 Hit Points, the Folding Boat is destroyed.

This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can take a Magic action and use one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:

**First Command Word.** The gem sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you take a Bonus Action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.

**Second Command Word.** You expend 1 charge and cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Third Command Word.** You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.

The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or doff the armor.

### Gloves of Missile Snaring
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*
