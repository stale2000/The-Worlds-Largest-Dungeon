The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell).

**Languages** Common

**Shapechanger.** Longtail can use his action to polymorph into a rat-humanoid hybrid or into a giant rat, or back into his true form, which is humanoid. His statistics, other than his size, are the same in each form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying is not transformed. He reverts to his true form if he dies.

**Keen Smell.** Longtail has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

**Evasion.** When Longtail is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he instead takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if he fails.

**Share Spells.** Longtail can cast spells through Achsyyx as if Achsyyx were casting the spell (still uses Longtail's spell slots). In addition, Longtail can choose to have any spell he casts on himself also affect Achsyyx if Achsyyx is within 5 feet of Longtail at the casting.

**Spellcasting.** Longtail is a 6th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following sorcerer spells:

- Cantrips (5): *acid splash*, *light*, *mage hand*, *ray of frost*, *poison spray*

**Twinned Spell (points equal to the spell's level, cantrip costs 1).** When he casts a spell that can target only one creature and does not have a range of self, Longtail targets a second creature with the same spell. Twinned spell is not that useful as only his cantrips (and maybe *dispel magic*) are single targets; maybe something else would be better?

### Actions

**Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).** Longtail makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite. In place of one attack, he can use a cantrip.

**Bite (Rat or Hybrid Form Only).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with wererat lycanthropy.

**Hold/Open Portal.** Longtail can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to open the gateway. If another creature is attempting to close it, this legendary action initiates an opposed check instead.

**Escape.** Longtail can move up to his movement speed without provoking attacks of opportunity.

**Cast Spell.** Longtail uses his Share Spells ability to cast one of his spells.
