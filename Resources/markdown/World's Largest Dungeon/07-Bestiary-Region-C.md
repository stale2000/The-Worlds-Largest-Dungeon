**Corrosive Form.** A creature that touches the pudding or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 ft. of it takes 9 (2d8) acid damage. Any non-magical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls.

Each new pudding has hit points equal to half the original pudding's, rounded down. New puddings are one size smaller than the original pudding.

**Languages** telepathy 60 ft.  
**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

**Ooze Cube.** The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover. A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 14 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 14 (4d6) acid damage. The cube can hold only one large creature or up to four medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.

**Transparent.** Even when the cube is in plain sight, it is invisible to every creature that hasn't spotted it. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the cube as a hazy outline to the creature that made the check. A creature that enters the cube's space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube and is subjected to its Engulf, as described under Ooze Cube.

A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space and the creature takes 14 (4d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.

**Slimy Thoughts.** The ooze establishes telepathic contact with one creature within 30 ft. of the ooze, but its thought processes are so alien they register on humanoid minds as a psychic assault. The target creature takes 22 (5d8) psychic damage or half damage with a successful DC 12 Intelligence saving throw.

**Languages** the languages it knew in life  
**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP)

**Wight Commander.** Wight spawn within 30 ft. of the Wight have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against effects that turn the undead.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the wight has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The wight makes two longsword attacks or two longbow attacks. It can use its Life Drain in place of one longsword attack.

**Longsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d8 + 2) slashing damage, or 12 (2d10 + 2) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.

**Life Drain.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under the wight's control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve zombies under its control at one time.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage, or 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage if used with two hands.
