# Region B (continued)

## B81. Empty Stable

No noise comes from this cell.

Like the other holding pens, this stable is shoddily constructed. This stable is empty, save for some discarded refuse on the floor.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This stable is currently empty; the worgs normally housed in it are out on patrol with their hobgoblin masters. There is nothing of interest.

### Encounter Condition
Fear 15, Unhallowed

### Tactics
The goblins rely heavily on the training and cooperation of their worg mounts. It is quite obvious that the worgs stay here because they wish to, not because they are forced to.

### Treasure
N/A

## B82. The Goblin King's Mount, the Yeth Hound

A sleek hound with a dull, black coat and glowing cherry-red eyes pads around in the most luxurious pen in the stables. This is the mount of the goblin king, and the king takes very good care of it. With a lazy turn of its head, the yeth hound takes you in—and promptly dismisses you.

### Initial Attitude
Indifferent

### Encounter
The yeth hound is the pride of the goblin king. Serving as his personal mount, it is not only effective in combat, but the goblin king considers the hound a symbol of his power and divine rule. For its part, the yeth hound could care less about the PCs. It is confident in its combat abilities and knows its master's loyal servants are nearby.

The yeth hound only attacks if provoked.

### Encounter Condition
Fear 14, Fearless, Unhallowed

### Tactics
If the PCs attack the yeth hound, it flees and seeks out the goblin king (Room B75), unleashing a series of Bay attacks if cornered. If the PCs are stunned, the yeth hound slips by, continuing to Bay until it has escaped or is killed by the PCs.

Regardless of the outcome, the goblin king undoubtedly surmises the PCs killed his mount (unless he has yet to meet them, in which case he assumes it was bugbear raiders). Any alliance they forged is now broken. From this point on, all initial attitudes in encounters with the goblin king's soldiers are considered **Hostile**.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, have eight goblins arrive after 6d3 seconds to assist the yeth hound. To decrease the challenge, reduce the yeth hound's hit points by -20.

## B83. Southwestern Outpost

If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in Room B75, read the following.

> This squat, spartan room serves as the southwestern most outpost of the goblin empire. The dozen goblins in this room stare blankly at you as you enter. The goblin king has ordered his army to treat you with respect, but these goblins seem to be waiting for you to make a misstep; it is quite obvious they do not want you here.

If the PCs have not allied with the goblin king in Room B75, read the following.

> This squat room is an outpost, guarding against incursions. Nearly a dozen goblins are messing about and get into formation as you enter.

If the goblins are not surprised, read the following.

> They await you with their sharp spears pointing menacingly in your direction. They form a perfect phalanx and advance upon you.

### Initial Attitude
Unfriendly or Hostile

### Encounter
There are twelve goblin warriors standing guard here in various stages of readiness. If surprised, they take a round to form up into ranks. If they heard the PCs coming, they are already in formation when the door opens, whether the PCs are allies or not.

If the PCs formed an alliance with the goblin king, the initial attitude of the goblins is **Unfriendly**. They allow the PCs to wander through the barracks as long as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs take any actions the goblins perceive as a threat, their attitude becomes **Hostile** and they attack.

### Encounter Condition
Fearless

### Tactics
In combat, instead of swarming the PCs, they form up into ranks, four goblins abreast, three rows deep. They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest PCs with their spears. They hold their bucklers facing forward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them.

Two of the goblins are not Fearless and bail at the first sign of trouble (e.g., three goblins fall, they suffer at least 1 point of damage, overtly powerful magic is displayed, etc.). They head for Room B84 to retrieve reinforcements, taking 4d6 seconds to get there and 4d6 seconds to return.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add six goblins. To reduce the challenge of this encounter, remove six.

## B84. King's Elite Guard Barracks

If the PCs have formed an alliance with the goblin king in Room B75, read the following.

> These barracks are simple and minimalist. These goblins have no requirement for comfort; they are hardened soldiers ready to die for their king and their god. They stare at you but do not make any aggressive moves. The king has granted you his protection, and they will not violate his orders.

If the PCs have not formed an alliance with the goblin king in Room B75, read the following.

> These barracks are simple and minimalist.

If the goblins are not surprised, read the following.

> You are confronted by twelve zealous and well-trained goblins. They form one cohesive unit and raise their spears above their heads with a massive war cry.

### Initial Attitude
Indifferent or Hostile

### Encounter
There are twelve elite goblins standing guard here in various stages of readiness. If surprised, they take a round to form up into ranks. If they heard the PCs coming, they are already in formation when the door opens, whether the PCs are allies or not. They gain a +2 to their initiative rolls if the PCs make noise before entering.

If the PCs formed an alliance with the goblin king, the initial attitude of the goblins is **Indifferent**. They allow the PCs to wander through the barracks as long as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs take any actions the goblins perceive as a threat, their attitude becomes **Hostile** and they attack.

The room itself is a spartan affair with a weapon rack along the western wall and a precise layer of sleeping hides on the floor. If the PCs defeated the elite guard in Room B74, this room does not contain any goblins.

### Encounter Condition
Fearless

### Tactics
As soon as the goblins spot the PCs, they take up defensive positions in the nearby halls, while the smallest two run to Room B86 for reinforcements.

These goblins have been trained by the hobgoblins. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up into three ranks, four goblins abreast. They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest with their spears. The goblins hold their bucklers facing forward, offering more protection (+1 to AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them, as they fight more efficiently at close range.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, give each goblin +5 hp. To reduce the challenge, remove four goblins.

---

## B85. Hammerfist, Captain of the King's Guard

If the PCs have formed an alliance with the goblin king in Room B75, read the following.

> The large hobgoblin from the king's antechamber angrily paces back and forth in this room. He wields the same fist-shaped club, swinging wildly at the room's walls. As he notices you, he violently spits at the ground. "Come to try and finish what I started, have you?" he taunts.

If the PCs have not formed an alliance with the goblin king in Room B75, read the following.

> A large hobgoblin angrily paces back and forth in this room, he wields a fist-shaped club, swinging wildly at the room's walls. A feral grin sprouts across his scarred face and he turns to face you. "Finally!" he shouts.

After the PCs have cleared the room of any hostile creatures, or if they defeated Hammerfist in Room B74, read the following.

> Hammerfist's room is very spartan. A simple sleeping hide lies in a corner of the room. A map of the goblin empire is nailed to the southern wall. The western wall features a small collection of skulls, obviously war trophies the hobgoblin claimed from his foes.

### Initial Attitude
Unfriendly

### Encounter
Regardless of the PCs and their relationship with the goblin king, Hammerfist's attitude towards them is never better than **Unfriendly**. If the PCs killed the black worg in Room B79 (and he knows about it), Hammerfist becomes **Hostile** and attacks them, screaming about revenge.

As long as Hammerfist is merely **Unfriendly** towards the PCs, he doesn't initiate combat against them. He does, however, taunt, threaten, and otherwise provoke them into attacking him. Hammerfist does not like the PCs and wishes to see them dead.

### Encounter Condition
Fearless, Negative Energy, Unhallowed

### Tactics
Hammerfist thinks no one is stronger than he is. To prove it, he calls the strongest PC out to fight one-on-one. He goes toe to toe, never giving an inch. Because of his ego, he fights to the death.

If the PCs do not fight fair, neither does he. He finishes off unconscious PCs and helpless PCs have their fingers and hands broken under his boot or with his war club.

While fighting, he shouts obscenities and other unsavory things at the PCs but does not call for reinforcements. His aggressive and boisterous mannerism is sure to unnerve even the strongest PCs.

If reinforcements do arrive, it is of their own initiative. Hammerfist is immune to the Negative Energy in this room.

### Treasure
Hammerfist keeps a strongbox. It is unlocked as no one is foolish enough to tamper with his belongings. Inside the box is a sling, a handaxe, 450 gp, 51 pp, a silver and gold ring with detailed filigree, an inlaid design of an owl (600 gp), six arrows, four bolts, and two healing potions.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the elite goblins in Room B84 arrive 3d6 seconds later. To decrease the challenge, increase Haymaker's movement penalty to -30 ft., and remove the hit die based damage from Maim.

---

## B86. Drill Room

If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in Room B75, read the following.

> A huge hobgoblin barks commands and mercilessly drills a group of goblins. He glances over at you but says nothing. You get the distinct impression that treaty or no, this hobgoblin is looking for any excuse to test his men against your mettle.

If the PCs have not allied with the goblin king in Room B75, read the following.

> A mighty bellow erupts as you enter this room. 'At last! Fresh meat!" roars a huge hobgoblin wielding a wicked great axe. Upon his command, the goblins in the room form up and advance on you with calculating precision. The hobgoblin, however, charges at you with wild abandon.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
There are twelve goblin warriors in various stages of training in this room. If surprised, they take a round to form into ranks. If they heard the PCs coming, they are already in formation when the door opens, whether the PCs are allies or not.

If the PCs formed an alliance with the goblin king, the initial attitude of the goblins is **Indifferent**. They allow them to wander through the barracks as long as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs take any actions the goblins perceive as a threat, their attitude becomes **Hostile** and they attack.

Their leader, **Goblinbane**, is a wicked taskmaster and the chief trainer under the goblin king. He earned his name for his brutal methods and callous disregard for whoever could not withstand the training. As long as the PCs do not disrupt his training, he is content to let them watch and learn how a true master creates an army.

Of course, if the PCs have not allied with the goblin king, Goblinbane and his goblin trainees attack the PCs as soon as they step foot in the room.

### Encounter Condition
Fearless

### Tactics
These goblins have been trained by Goblinbane. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up into ranks, four goblins abreast, three rows deep. They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest with their spears. They hold their bucklers facing forward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them forming a defensive line of spears.

Goblinbane seeks out the most prominent PC and engages them in close combat, swinging his powerful greataxe mercilessly. Occasionally Goblinbane barks commands to the goblins, adjusting their tactics to keep up with the PCs' movements.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase challenge, goblin warriors from Room B83 arrive in 6d6 seconds. To lessen it, remove Goblinbane's Martial Advantage and lower the number affected by the Commander of the King's Horde to one.

---

## B87. Patrol Barracks

If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in Room B75, read the following.

> This barracks is a long room with simple weapon racks and hides on the floor. You are met with some cold stares and toothy grimaces but are otherwise left alone by the goblins.

If the PCs have not formed an alliance with the goblin king in Room B75, read the following.

> A patrol, recently returned, stops in their tracks as you enter the room. With uncanny precision, they return to formation and set their sights on you.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
This room is a holding area. Returning patrols rest here before going back out. There is a staging area towards the east where the patrols depart from. There are twelve goblin warriors stowing gear and relaxing. If surprised, they take a round to form up into ranks. If they heard the PCs coming, they are already in formation when the door opens, whether the PCs are allies or not.

If the PCs are allies of the goblin king, the initial attitude of the goblins is **Indifferent**. They allow the PCs to wander through the barracks as long as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs take any actions the goblins perceive as a threat, their attitude becomes **Hostile** and they attack the PCs.

The barracks itself resembles others in the goblin empire. The weapons racks and sleeping hides are precisely arranged and the crude map in the middle of the room accurately details the goblin patrols in this area of the dungeon.

### Encounter Condition
Fearless

### Tactics
If the PCs engage the goblins they have to deal with reinforcements. After 6d6 seconds, another phalanx of twelve goblin warriors arrive from Room B88. Their tactics are identical to the goblins already engaged with the PCs, but they attempt to flank the PCs currently engaged.

These goblins have been trained by Goblinbane (Room B86). Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up into three ranks, four goblins abreast. They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest with their spears. The goblins hold their bucklers facing forward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them, fighting better close in.

### Treasure
The footlockers are filled with personal (worthless) trinkets, only valuable to the goblins.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the goblin warriors from Room B88 join the battle one turn after rolling initiative. To decrease the challenge, the goblins from Room B88 arrive after 36 seconds.

---

## B88. Southeastern Outpost

If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in room B75, read the following.

> This outpost serves as a forward observation point and command center in the goblin king's war against the rebel splinter faction. A dozen goblins prepare themselves for their next patrol as you enter. Your presence is ignored, as the goblins have more pressing concerns. Reports of a large upcoming raid are circulating amongst the troops, and each wants to be a member of the patrol that crushes the rebel scum.

If the PCs have not allied with the goblin king in Room B75, read the following.

> As you enter this outpost, a dozen bloodthirsty goblins turn and face you. They quickly grab their weapons and form an impressive phalanx. Their spear points drop and they attack.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
This room is a transitional chamber. Returning patrols rest here before going back out. There is a staging area towards the east where the patrols depart from. There are twelve goblin warriors stowing gear and relaxing. If surprised, they take a round to form up into ranks. If they heard the PCs coming, they are already in formation when the door opens, whether the PCs are allies or not.

If the PCs have allied with the goblin king, the initial attitude of the goblins is **Indifferent**. They allow the PCs to wander through the barracks as long as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs take any actions the goblins perceive as a threat, their attitude becomes **Hostile** and they attack the PCs.

The barracks itself is much like the others contained in the goblin empire. The weapons racks and sleeping hides are arranged precisely and the crude map in the middle of the room accurately details the goblin patrols in this area of the dungeon.

### Encounter Condition
Fearless

### Tactics
If the PCs engage the goblins they have to deal with reinforcements. After 6d6 seconds of combat, another phalanx of twelve goblin warriors arrive from Room B87. Their tactics are identical to the goblins already engaged with the PCs, but they attempt to flank the PCs currently engaged.

These goblins have been trained by Goblinbane (Room B86). Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up into three ranks, four goblins abreast. They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest with their spears. The goblins hold their bucklers facing forward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them, fighting better close in.

### Treasure
The footlockers are filled with personal (worthless) trinkets, only valuable to the goblins.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, have the goblins from Room B87 join the battle after 36 seconds.

## B89. Haunted Tombs

> The hallways intersect, again and again. It would seem as though a door could appear somewhere. But there is none. Just the same clean corridor over and over again. And then the realization that the silence is heavy hits you. Something is amiss.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
A sense of dread should overcome the PCs at this point. Feel free to spook them at every turn with shadows and intermittent sounds of chains rattling. Have the *command*, *suggestion*, and *cause fear* spells be cast on them randomly. Lastly, a deep, allip-like moan is sure to scare them straight.

In addition to any other effects going on, there is a blanket of silence that pervades the tomb and affects the PCs 50% of the time, severely hampering their ability to communicate and cast spells. While there is no noise, treat this as Distracting Noises for the purposes of spellcasting.

#### Haunted Tomb Contents

For every tomb the PCs open, roll on this table:

| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | A hot wind escapes from the tomb. **Drafty**. |
| 2 | A swarm of rats run past the PCs and out the door. While they are no threat and deal no damage, if they run west or south they are sure to find the goblins who send scouts to investigate. |
| 3 | A small earthquake rumbles through the section. **Tremors 15**. |
| 4-12 | Nothing. |
| 13 | The tomb is worn by time and falling apart. If the PCs decide to enter despite this it begins to crumble and fall inward on them. Any PCs who fail a Dexterity (DC 15) saving throw receive 6d4 bludgeoning damage as the stone collapses onto them. |
| 14 | A *fire trap* (Room B18) has been cast on the threshold to keep grave robbers at bay. |
| 15 | The door unseals and a deluge of water pours forth. PCs within 10 ft. have their torches doused and are soaked. |
| 16 | When the threshold is crossed, a spray of darts fly out of the tomb. Any creature not completely obscured by another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage and be poisoned until their next long rest. The trapped tiles can be found with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled with a further DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand). |
| 17 | When the seal on the tomb breaks, centuries of death fumes (a 5th-level *cloudkill*, spell save DC 14) roll forth from the tomb. |
| 18 | The PCs are attacked by 1d3+1 **wights**. |
| 19 | The PCs are attacked by 1d4+1 **vargouilles**. **Ambush**. |
| 20 | The PCs are attacked by 1d6+1 **ghouls**. |

While the map does not show secret doors, there is a way to enter each tomb. The mechanism is complicated and to date, the goblins have not found it.

Located at the two-foot-high mark on the north wall of each tomb is a small unholy sigil. While each is designed differently, the key to opening the tomb is through this sigil. There are three different ways to open the tomb. One is for a lawful good PC (or one you determine sufficiently demonstrates those values) to completely trace the entire surface of the sigil. Another is to cast *knock* directly onto the sigil. Finally, the PCs can smear the blood of an angel into the sigil, covering the surface.

If any of these actions are taken, a 5-ft-by-5-ft section of wall slides open and up into the ceiling. If the PCs open a tomb, roll on the table in the previous page to see if they encounter anything:

### Encounter Condition
[Ambush], Cursed 3, [Distracting Noises], Drafty, Fear 16, Haunted, Negative Energy, [Spell Resistance], Unhallowed

### Tactics
Once the tomb is open, the creatures (if present) lunge at the PCs. These beasts have been entombed for centuries and are eager to escape, most likely fighting in a crazed and wild manner. The actual details are left up to the GM, but these creatures are interested in feeding on the flesh of one PC and escaping soon after. Killing them all is not possible.

The ghouls attack the lead PCs, the vargouilles use their Kiss attack, and the wights swipe at the PC with the least armor on. They do not put themselves in harm's way to get to the PCs but do not let the PCs box them in either.

### Treasure
None of these creatures were buried with treasure, but the GM is welcome to drop a trinket here and there, so the PCs don't feel cheated. The largest treasure should be no bigger than a +1 dagger or a healing potion.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, roll twice per tomb. To decrease the challenge, roll once for every 2 tombs opened.

---

## B90. Abandoned Barracks

The hallway leading to this room is trapped. Allow the PCs Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice, but since there are four traps in various locations, the GM should feel free to use them as they see fit.

#### Portcullis Trap
When 15 lbs. of weight are applied to the pressure plate on either side of the arch a portcullis slams down. Creatures underneath are skewered and crushed and must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13) or take 2d8 piercing and 2d8 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, creatures that fail to save are pinned underneath, preventing movement until freed. Any creature that can lift 200 lbs. of weight can reliably lift the gate 1 ft. off the ground, with the weight requirement doubling for each additional foot of distance desired.

While not subtle, the trap still requires active attention to notice. Once found the plate can simply be stepped over, or disabled by wedging it.

#### Spring-loaded Darts
When the tripwire is pulled a spray of darts snap across the hall. Starting from the east wall any creature not completely obscured by another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage and be poisoned until their next long rest.

The trap holes and tripwire can be found with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled with a further DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand). Undoing this mechanism leaves the darts open for the taking. The first time a dart deals damage it loses its poison and poisons the damaged creature if they fail a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.

#### Crude Spear Trap
Any PC rolling higher than 12 on a Wisdom (Perception) check in the hall easily spots the spears. These spears spring forward if the trigger (a weave of wooden poles hidden under a hide on the floor, spanning the hall) is activated. Disarming it is as simple as knocking each of the two spears over, where their springs engage and disarm themselves.

PCs that fail to notice the spears or charge in heedlessly and trigger the trap, must succeed a Dexterity save (DC 15) or receive 1d8 piercing damage.

#### Tripping Chain
Strung across the path is a thin chain. Robust enough to be a tripping hazard, and acting as a setup for a much nastier chain. Both are simple and crudely concealed (DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) required to spot). Stepping on the first chain will knock the victim prone unless they pass a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (DC 12), wherein they must succeed a second Dexterity saving throw (DC 14) to take half damage from falling onto the spiked chain.

Creatures that step onto the spiked chain receive 2d8 piercing damage as the wicked hooks and barbs rend at them. They may also trip from this, requiring the same saves as above but done with advantage this time. Reduce this damage by 1 for every point of AC the creature possesses over 12. Creatures that fall onto the chain receive an additional 1d8 damage for each size category they are above small (medium +1d8, large +2d8, huge +3d8).

Outside of adverse circumstances, small and tiny creatures are not tall enough to fall onto the spiked chain and simply faceplant into the floor.

Disarming the chains requires pulling the interlocking pins that keep them taut and tossing them aside. No check is needed once spotted. However, the mechanism isn't completely intuitive. Less mechanically inclined PCs might require a successful Intelligence (Investigation) (DC 10) check to understand.

> A long wide room stretches before you. Abandoned, disheveled, and broken bunks and cots line the walls and floor. Someone or something has ransacked these chambers. The thick layer of dust suggests it was not recently cleaned.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Long ago, the goblins controlled most of the Region. Now, with the bugbear raiding parties and goblin rebels, it is difficult to control the outlying sections. The hobgoblins convinced the goblin king it would be easier to defend a smaller area, and pulled back to Room B69 through B88 (hence the concentration of manpower in such a small area).

As a result, they often send patrols up here to "check things out," but the recent "tossing" of the room has caused them to rethink their strategy. If a goblin Random Encounter is rolled in the vicinity of Rooms B90 and B91, there is a 50% chance the Encounter is "Nothing."

### Encounter Condition
Fearless, Hazardous Footing 14

### Tactics
There is nothing here now, but if the PCs insist on rummaging through the debris, feel free to have a bugbear patrol happen upon them.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a pit trap (Room B40). To reduce the challenge, remove the portcullis trap.

---

## B91. Northeastern Outpost

> This box-like room smells of charcoal and smoke. The blackened walls and burned furniture indicate only one culprit—fire. Along the back wall, resting on a small ledge, is a red and black urn, apparently unscarred by all the chaos.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Another abandoned outpost, this room has been set ablaze and sacked several times, leaving the goblins wondering what the bugbears' true tactics are. On the far wall is a small ledge with a red and black urn. On its face is written "The Unnamed Law" in Goblinoid. The bugbears hope that the goblins will inspect it or at least assume an important bugbear was killed. So far no one has fallen for it, but should anyone touch the urn, a trap triggers and darts fly from the north and south walls.

#### Spring-loaded Darts
When the urn is touched darts spray across the room. Starting from the traps' respective walls any creature not completely obscured by another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage and be poisoned until their next long rest. This occurs twice, once for the north and once for the south.

The trap-holes and hair trigger beneath the urn can be found with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check, or a Wisdom (Perception) roll over 18 in the room, and disabled with a DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand). Undoing this mechanism leaves the darts open for the taking. When used as weapons, the first time a dart deals damage it loses its poison and poisons the target if they fail a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.

### Encounter Condition
Ambush

### Tactics
This room is patrolled by the bugbears often. They hope the goblins will believe the room was an important outpost and its loss drove them deeper into the dungeon, or that an important bugbear was killed here. Either way, its presence baffles the goblins and sooner or later a patrol will get antsy and grab the urn. To add insult to injury, if the trap goes off, there is a 25% chance that bugbears from Room B66 arrive to investigate in 3d6 rounds.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge, add a loud alarm to the trap that guarantees bugbears from room B66 investigate. To reduce the challenge, lower the Wisdom (Perception) check to 14.

## B92. The Maze

**No Random Encounters occur inside or near the Maze. Instead, see Special Encounter instructions below.**

#### Special Encounters

| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | The path is trapped with **Spring-loaded Darts**. When the tripwire is pulled a spray of darts snap across the hall. Pick d3 PCs, they must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage and be poisoned until their next long rest. The trap holes and tripwire can be found with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled with a further DC 16 Sleight of Hand. Undoing this mechanism leaves the darts open for the taking. The first time a dart deals damage it loses its poison and poisons the damaged creature if they fail a Constitution (DC 14) save. |
| 2 | A whittled wooden duckling lies off the path. Touching the duckling soaks the PC and casts *lightning bolt* (spell save DC 13) at 3rd level towards them. This happens only once, and *dispel magic* will remove the hostile enchantment without harming the item. Any creature who holds the duckling is rapidly soaked, conferring resistance to fire damage and vulnerability to lightning damage while held. Dropping the duck dries them off instantly. |
| 3 | A *glyph of warding* (3rd level, explosive, fire) is inscribed in the hallway. Circumventing this takes 10 minutes. |
| 4 | An illusory beast stalks the hallway. The PC that witnesses it first is harried by the *phantasmal killer* spell once every hour, for the next 10 hours or until it is slain. The beast runs but if chased is ultimately cornered. It has the stats of a wolf but is resistant to nonmagical damage. |
| 5 | A *fire trap* (Room B18) is cast on a tile in the hallway. It can be spotted with a Wisdom (Perception) check roll of 14 or greater. PCs that can sense magic have advantage on this roll. Failure of any party member to spot the trap sets it off. |
| 6-12 | Nothing. |
| 13 | A dead blink dog lies in the hallway, covered in blood and stinger holes (stirges). **Stagnant Air**. |
| 14 | The air is alive with 2d8+1 **stirges**. The stirges buzz loudly and dart back and forth across the hall. |
| 15 | A lone **wight** wanders the hall, seeking refuge from the infernal maze. As it spots the PCs it lets out a blood-curdling scream and attacks. |
| 16 | Vines cloak the walls, choking the torchlight and cutting vision in half. Lurking amongst the greenery are 2d6 **assassin vines** lying in wait for unsuspecting prey. **Ambush**. |
| 17 | 1d4+1 **vargouilles** screech and whine as they corner a lone rebel goblin. The goblin is curled up in a ball, crying and shrieking, but the vargouilles are too loud. They are enjoying their torment of the goblin and suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the PCs. |
| 18 | A group of 2d6+3 **goblins** stumble across the PCs. These are rebel goblins making a foray into the goblin king's territory and do not expect to find anyone in the maze. Confused, and unsure of the PCs, they do not attack. Their attitude is **Friendly** unless attacked. |
| 19 | One **hobgoblin**, mounted on a **worg**, and six **goblin warriors** hunt for rebel goblins. They are loyal and obedient to the goblin king but patrol the maze fearfully. If the PCs have an alliance with the goblin king their attitude is **Indifferent** (unless attacked). Otherwise, their attitude is **Hostile**. |
| 20 | **Bartleby** (Room B28) races through the maze. He knows the maze is not a safe place to be and he appears to be dancing around stone to stone, trying to avoid particular spots in the maze. If the PCs work out a deal with Bartleby, he guides them through the maze, cutting in half the number of random encounters the PCs must experience. Nonetheless, he does not know the way out and uses Survival to look for drafts and other tell-tale signs of an exit. |

> You enter a long, winding tunnel. The walls are covered in moss and vines and a pungent stench fills the air. Off in the distance, you can hear the sounds of various creatures, their echoes playing tricks along the snaking corridor.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The maze is a unique feature in the Region. No groups claim it and most avoid it if possible. It is a very dangerous, ever-changing trap. The bugbears and hobgoblins are smart enough to avoid the dangers of the maze, while the goblins have developed a number of superstitions regarding it.

The goblin rebels use the maze to their advantage. Situating themselves on the other end of the maze, they have a nearly impassable barrier between them and their rivals. This, coupled with the wild passages in the northeast, has allowed them to continue their existence in the Region. A few of the leaders of these goblins are starting to turn their superstitions into a counter-religion. If the new god is all-powerful, wouldn't he have destroyed the maze for his followers? Since he has not, these rebel goblins believe the maze is the home of their old gods, the spirits in the rock their grandfathers' grandfathers worshiped.

As the PCs make their way through this maze, its denizens and a series of traps confront them. Every 30 minutes spent in Room B92, roll on the Special Encounters table, then roll on the second table for any special Encounter Conditions.

## B93-B108. Heathen Goblin Rebels

Not all goblins fell in love with the new god. A small group held tight to the old ways, worshiping the power of the rock spirits as their ancestors had done for countless centuries before them. Once their king had been usurped, these rebellious goblins had no choice but to flee.

Fear of persecution overruled their fear of the dreaded maze to the east of the goblin lands. The goblins fled into its dangerous, confusing hallways eluding capture or other unsavory fates. Only two-thirds of the goblins made it through the maze, but that was a far larger number than any of the fleeing rebels anticipated.

With the maze between them and their rivals, the goblins quickly went to work setting up a new home for themselves. They claimed the area in the southeast corner of the dungeon as their own. The maze protects their western flank, while the wild treacherous passages to the north provide ample defense against raids by the goblin empire.

A chieftain named **Guk** leads these goblins. While not as clever as Argliss, he is smarter than most goblins. He is starting to think that the new deity is not as powerful as his supporters claim. Why has this deity not destroyed the maze? Why were the followers of the old ways allowed to escape? Guk believes the answer lies with his gods. The stone spirits are watching over his people and are rewarding their loyalty.

To Guk's people the maze is not something to be scared of or frightened by; it is the home of their gods. They see now they were too ignorant to realize it before. Only the unwary are punished for trespassing in the home of the gods. Those truly devout and loyal can pass through as they wish. The rebels have used the maze to their advantage, both for protection and as a place from which to strike at the usurper's empire.

### Random Encounters

Roll for a Random Encounter once per hour.

| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | The ground is littered with rubble and other detritus. Whether a trap caused this, or the earthquake that shook the dungeon so long ago, is unclear. What is apparent however is that the debris makes walking through this area very difficult. **Hazardous Footing 15**. |
| 2-14 | Nothing. |
| 15 | A group of 1d3+1 **ethereal marauders** are exploring the dungeon and chance upon the PCs. Their attitude is **Indifferent** unless attacked. The ethereal marauders are curious about the PCs, they are used to goblinoids but not much else on two legs. |
| 16 | A pack of four **blink dogs** lazily make their way through the dungeon. Their attitude is **Indifferent** unless attacked. |
| 17 | A patrol of 2d4+2 **rebel goblins**, led by a goblin mounted on a **worg**, wind their way through the dungeon. These goblins are rebels, fighting the goblin king's forces. If the PCs are allied with the goblin king, their attitude is **Hostile**. If the PCs are allied with the rebel goblin faction, their attitude is **Indifferent**. Otherwise, their attitude is **Unfriendly**. |
| 18 | A **hobgoblin**, mounted on a wounded **worg**, is being followed by 3d6+3 weary **goblins**. They have been raiding the rebel faction, and have suffered casualties. They are wary of an ambush and receive advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. |
| 19 | An ear-piercing shriek fills the dungeon as a pack of 2d4+1 **howlers** rounds the corner. They have been hunting goblins, but the PCs will serve their purpose equally well. |
| 20 | **Bartleby** enters the room just before the PCs do. Not wishing to be seen by the meddling PCs he ducks behind an outcropping. Bartleby receives advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. **Cover**. |

## B93. The Watch Room

When the PCs enter Room B93, read the following.

> This room is filled with goblins. They stare at you blankly for a brief moment, before attacking.

After the PCs have dealt with the goblins, read this:

> This room is small and cramped. It contains only an empty weapon rack against the eastern wall. The rebel goblins use this room as a staging area to launch attacks against the goblins in the west.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
The rebel goblins are confused by the appearance of the PCs. They were planning a raid against the goblin king when the PCs entered the room. Thinking the PCs are agents of Argliss, they attack the PCs regardless of their true standing with the goblin king.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
The goblins simply swarm the PCs, attacking them en masse. They attack the PCs closest to them without regard for their personal safety. They will not stop until either the PCs or they are subdued.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove two goblins.

## B94. The Secret Entrance

The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.

> This small room is empty. The slate gray walls are blank and unadorned. On the far wall hangs a banner with a crude goblin sigil on it, perhaps defiantly opposing the goblin king.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This secret entrance is the only way into the rebel goblins' new home. The rebel goblin chieftain, Guk, guided by the stone spirits, brought his people here. While Room B95 serves as their main hall, the goblins wisely decided to hide their new homes behind this hidden passage. The entrance is not guarded so it does not call attention to itself. The goblins rely on the dangers of the maze and the spiked pit trap (Room B1) in this room to defend against serious incursions from their cousins.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
A secret door in the eastern wall leads to Room B98. A DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check is required to locate the door's latch, which is hidden behind the goblin banner. The secret door isn't locked and opens easily. In the center of the room is a pit, carefully disguised to look like stone.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add 10 feet of depth to the spiked pit trap. To reduce the difficulty, double the amount of temporary hit points granted to players caught in the trap.

## B95. Hall of the Rebels

> This room is huge and filled with goblins. Everywhere you turn you see them. Their cold, hate-filled eyes stare back at you. A number hiss and spit, gripping their spears tighter. Just when you think the goblins will attack, a large goblin near the back of the room raises a hand and utters a simple command. The mass of goblins steps aside, forming a perfect aisle from the door to their chieftain.

### Initial Attitude
Unfriendly

### Encounter
This is the main room of the rebel goblins. Twenty rebel goblin warriors make their home here. From the hall, they meet and plan their raids, and the chieftain, **Guk**, holds what passes for his court. It is a simple room without ornamentation, save for a low, makeshift table in the center of the room and a single stool, used by Guk.

### Encounter Condition
Fearless

### Tactics
Guk stops the goblins from attacking the PCs on sight. The chieftain is curious about them and wishes to know if they are in league with the goblin king, Argliss (Room B75). If the PCs convince Guk they are not allied with Argliss, he grants them safe passage through his encampment, provided the PCs do not disturb anything.

Guk also tries to enlist the PCs aid in his war against Argliss. He believes they have been brought to him by his gods. Why else would they be here if not to combat the usurper and restore order?

If Guk suspects the PCs of being allied with Argliss, he and the other goblins instantly turn **Hostile** and attack the PCs.

Like all rebels, these goblins lack hobgoblin training and the complex tactics their cousins use. The rebels use standard swarm tactics to overwhelm and subdue the PCs.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge, add six goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove six.

## B96. Storeroom

> Constructed simply of gray stone, this room looks mostly like a makeshift storeroom. Dried rushes litter the floor, and the weapon racks are filled with spears. A few barrels are stacked against one wall. The remaining barrels reek of something unpleasant.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Located at the end of the hall, this room marks the beginning of the hidden goblin encampment. The rushes strewn around on the floor function as an early trespassing system. The door to the Rebel Barracks (Room B97) is thin, and the sound of anyone walking over the rushes alerts the goblins stationed there to potential intruders.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
Allow goblins in Room B97 Wisdom (Perception) checks, with advantage if the PCs walk on the rushes.

### Treasure
A dozen short spears are stacked on the weapons rack and the barrels are filled with flammable oil.

### Scaling
N/A
