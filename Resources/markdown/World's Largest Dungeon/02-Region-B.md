# Region B

REGION B . 
A GOBLIN EMPIRE!
Designed unlike other prisons in this dungeon, 
Region B became known as “the laboratory” where 
celestials studied prisoners to research the nature 
of evil and understand how best to keep it in check. 
While many of the lawful good angels and archons 
frowned on this practice, the lawful neutral and 
chaotic good guardians were less reviled. In the end, 
the angels turned a blind eye to it, and allowed the 
“harmless” experiments to continue.
Like many areas in the dungeon, this Region is a 
maze of rooms and hallways. It remained unchanged 
over the centuries and even followed the chaos of the 
first earthquake. Though inhabitants fled when wards 
were dispelled, some occupants remain bloodthirsty. 
And while the Region did not change as drastically as 
others had, it did not escape unscathed.
The air is dry, dusty and unmoving, not unlike 
being in a tomb. PCs walking through these claus-
trophobic hallways hear strange echoes and moans 
everywhere, as drafts of hot and cold air cut through 
the corridors at irregular intervals. It is at 
once inhospitable and unnerving. Now home 
to three goblinoid races, as well as various 
wild beasts, the PCs have more to worry 
about than mere traps, spooky noises, and un-
explainable visions.
The inhabitants of the Region have added 
to the celestial’s magical traps with 
crude (but effective) traps of their own. 
Tripwire, scything blades, and pit traps 
make navigating this Region diffi-
cult for low-level PCs. All the while, clever 
goblinoids hunt the PCs at every turn. If there 
is one thing the Region is known for, it’s this 
flavor of chaos.
Before the Region’s newest visitors arrived, 
the dungeon contained a distorted hierarchy, 
where celestials guarded against potential 
escape from the demons inside and an-
gels stood vigilant against all manner of evil 
confined within. After the earthquake, all that 
changed. When the majority of rooms were 
emptied and the demons inside the remaining 
cells no longer had any hope of escape, the 
Region was abandoned. Many celestials lost 
their lives in the riots that erupted over the 
centuries that followed and the decision to seal 
Region N was made.
And while the angels looked away, creatures 
migrated to Region B, looking for a new home 
where order was as common as justice.

113
Goblinoids arrived en masse, digging through 
whatever hole they could find, following the derro 
and drow. However, the northernmost reaches of the 
dungeon had already been “claimed” and the crea-
tures were quickly pushed south. As the years went 
by, more and more goblins arrived and migration to 
Region B became easier.
Once they arrived, camps formed quickly and the 
goblins skirmished with the bugbears and the bug-
bears warred with the hobgoblins. They returned to 
their way of life and fights over territory became as 
common as goblin tribe name changes.
Hundreds of years of warfare lead to the goblinoids 
trading control like currency. No single force ever 
stayed in power for more than a generation (and to 
goblinoids that’s more like 8 years) and the condition 
of the Region is in a state of flux, no matter what the 
goblin king (Room B75) says.
For centuries, the bugbears have fought a two front 
war against the goblins and hobgoblins, never allying 
with either and always seeking to route the other 
races from the Region. Their strength and ferocity 
easily dominated the goblins in battle and forced the 
hobgoblins into a remote corner of the region. They 
learned to use the traps built by the celestials to their 
own advantage, often luring the less intelligent gob-
lins into them. Only the sheer numbers of goblins 
and the tactics employed by the hobgoblins prevent-
ed the bugbears from totally dominating the Region 
as the sole goblinoid race.
The hobgoblins, currently the smallest group of 
goblinoids in the dungeon, try in vain to assert con-
trol over the Region. Their tactics and strategies are 
sound, but with their number diminished they are 
never able to claim more than a scant portion of the 
Region. Once, they ruled the northeastern portion of 
the dungeon but their rule was cut short by the earth-
quake. The damage done to their domain was stag-
gering, and their ranks decimated as a result. They 
were forced back towards the center of the dungeon, 
where they have been trapped between the goblins 
and bugbears ever since.
The goblins, led by their king Sug’kt in recent years, 
are by far the most numerous race in the Region. 
Their sheer numbers have allowed them to hold their 
ground against the bugbears for centuries. Surpris-
ingly, they had few overt clashes with the hobgoblins. 
The bugbears were a large enough threat that the 
smaller contingent of hobgoblins often went unno-
ticed. Over the years a stalemate has emerged, and 
an uneasy status quo has evolved.
None of the races are content, however. Far from it.
Recently, a force like none before arrived to alter 
the landscape and bring new order to the Region. If 
you query the goblins, they tell you: a new god has 
arrived. A statue of his likeness lies to the east and is 
nothing less than awe-inspiring. The goblins at last 
have a champion to smite their oppressors.
So great is the power of this faith in Norendithas 
Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes, that 
the goblins splintered and even with the goblin king’s 
power, he was unable to unite the fractured tribe. 
Forming their own brand of culture, the goblins now 
pay homage to their great god, who graces them with 
power and terror, promising to rain justice down 
upon their enemies.

114
Upon hearing news of this new deity the goblin 
king became enraged. As his kingdom became en-
tranced with the concept of a goblin god, he sensed 
his power and influence slipping. A close advisor to 
the king suggested he embrace the new religion.
The king would have none of it.
With Sug’kt set against the new god, his advisors 
rose up and imprisoned him for heresy. The supersti-
tious guards led the goblin king away and the charis-
matic advisor, known as Argliss, assumed the throne, 
proclaiming himself king and the direct messenger of 
their god. In one fell swoop, he reunited the troubled 
people and forged a new religion, one that could be 
used to create whatever laws he chose, through the 
will of their new god. And while no one noticed, the 
new king systematically changed the entire goblin 
culture in a few brief strokes, bending them in the 
direction of his personal ideals.
Argliss, the new goblin king, was and still is a dop-
pelganger. He wandered into this Region less than 
a decade ago and was amused by the goblins. Able 
to hide his form, his brilliant mind made the dop-
pelganger stand out. Soon he became an advisor to 
the king, and when the opportunity to become more 
presented itself, he seized it. Despite his brilliant, 
tactical, and plotting mind, he cannot see all things at 
once and the truth of this “deity” is not what it seems.
In truth, this deity was nothing more than a way-
ward hunter, turned to stone by a cockatrice (Room 
C16). Frightened by this unfamiliar creature, the gob-
lin’s eyes went wide and he raised his arms over his 
head in a meager attempt to protect himself. It was in 
this pose that he was most unfortunately petrified by 
the cockatrice. Goblins that followed, misinterpreting 
the stone goblin’s fearful expression, concluded that 
a new and powerful goblin god was looking down on 
them, demanding their favor and devotion. How else 
could they explain this awkward statue?
While the majority of the goblins follow their new 
god and king, a sizeable minority have broken off 
and formed a resistance movement. They continued 
to follow their old religion and despise the new king 
for usurping the throne. They are not alone in their 
opposition to the new regime.
The bugbears found themselves on the receiving 
end of ferocious attacks and canny strategy soon 
after Argliss claimed the throne. The new goblin king 
has struck a pact with the hobgoblins that remain, 
and now they serve the goblin king as instructors, 
advisors, and enforcers. Using worgs and howlers as 
mounts, they’ve created a fast-attack unit like noth-
ing the goblins could even conceive of. With their 
new allies and tactics and their new god, the goblins 
have driven back the bugbears, asserting their con-
trol over the majority of the Region. Now the goblins 
under Argliss fight a two-front war for the first time 
in their history. The rebel goblins in the south and 
the bugbears in the north harass and chip away at 
Argliss’ empire bit by bit, using every bit of cunning 
and trickery at their disposal. For all their bravado 
however, the zealous goblins under Argliss are firmly 
in control of the Region.
Dominated by an iron fist, the goblin empire will 
not (and cannot) be opposed.

115
WHAT ELSE
But the Region isn’t all goblins and mad religions. In 
addition to the goblinoids, a number of other beasts 
call this Region home. Dire wolves, a few undead, and 
so many traps that the goblins cannot see straight.
More than a few ethereal marauders were trapped 
in this Region around the time of the earthquake. For 
the most part they make their home in the northeast-
ern section of the dungeon.
Whether brought in by the celestials to curtail the 
activities of the goblinoids, or simply here due to the 
aftermath of the earthquake, this Region is home to a 
number of blink dogs. They can be found throughout 
the dungeon, except for in the domain of the goblin 
king. Here they are hunted as vermin by the goblins. 
The blink dogs are mainly found in the northern and 
northeastern sections of the dungeon.
The most unique creature in the dungeon is the 
goblin king’s mount: a yeth hound. How it came to 
be trapped in this Region is unknown. Shortly after 
Argliss’ rise to power, it arrived and he immediately 
charged his hobgoblin taskmasters with capturing it 
and turning it into his personal mount.
While most of the traps were designed to contain 
and “hold” the inhabitants of the dungeon, some 
take the form of puzzles that the unwary must solve, 
lest they suffer at the celestials’ hands. And if that 
weren’t enough, Argliss has ordered more traps be 
made to secure his “kingdom".
Lastly, somewhere in the darkness, a halfling 
adventurer searches for a powerful artifact that has 
slipped through the goblin king’s grasp.
THE HALFLING
Found throughout the Region is a halfling adventurer 
named Bartleby.
It is very likely the PCs will encounter him long 
before they find Toom B28. If they do, this is the Ran-
dom Encounter text.
BARTLEBY
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Along with the goblinoids and other 
creatures that inhabit this dungeon, there is a 
solitary halfling named Bartleby. While the halfling 
normally is found in Room B28, he is by no means 
stationary. The PCs have a chance of encountering 
him anywhere in the dungeon.
How the halfling entered the dungeon is un-
known. He is in league with the goblin king and 
searches for a mysterious artifact of allegedly great 
power (see sidebar The Artifact). While the goblins 
know of the halfling, they don’t know much. Any at-
tempt to glean information from a captured goblin 
reveals that a halfling is in the dungeon and that 
they assist him if he is attacked. Otherwise, they are 
to leave him alone.
The halfling, Bartleby, is only concerned with his 
own well-being and his quest for the artifact. He is 
in league with the goblin king solely to garner the 
protection of the goblins. Once he finds his artifact 
he will leave the dungeon, presumably by the way 
he entered.
Encounter Condition: Ambush
Tactics: Bartleby fights as long as he needs to in or-
der to escape. He knows the dungeon very well and 
is confident he can lose any attackers as long as he 
can flee. If the PCs capture him, Bartleby becomes 
belligerent, hurling insults and curses at the PCs. 
He does not answer any questions and attempts to 
escape at the first possible opportunity.
Treasure: Aside from his possessions, Bartleby has no 
other treasure.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter 
use the improved versions of Bartleby’s rogue abili-
ties listed under “Difficulty Increase.”

116
THE KEY
During the chaos that resulted in the years following 
the second earthquake, the celestials sealed off this 
portion of the dungeon, locking all the doors leading 
north. None of the doors that lead to Region E can 
be opened or unlocked without the aid of a key found 
in Region C (Room C105 to be exact). The celestials 
entrusted the key to the lantern archon in Region C, 
who in turn hid it in a room full of false keys.
When this fake key is used to unlock any of the 
doors leading north, a sonic blast trap is triggered. In 
addition to the damage caused to the PCs, the sound 
automatically alerts all creatures in adjacent rooms.
 '
Thunderous Glyph of Warding Trap. As the incorrect 
key is inserted, the channels align with the trigger 
mechanism, setting off a series of ominous clicks 
and thuds. A magic hum whirrs for only a moment, 
during which time those who can perceive magic 
will bear witness to white hot runes searing the area 
around the lock. Seconds later a thunderous blast 
rips from the keyhole. Any creature within 5 ft must 
succeed a (DC 13) Dexterity saving throw or take 
8d4 Thunder damage and be knocked back 10 ft. 
Creatures that succeed the saving throw take half 
damage and are not moved.
The trap is ancient, with evocation magic inside 
only glowing faintly when idle, and invisible without 
detect magic. Succeeding an Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check (DC 15) gives the player the impression 
that the lock is suspiciously made, appearing to 
accept false keys for an unknown purpose.
Dispel magic will eliminate the trap, but the door 
remains locked. After detonating or being dispelled 
the trap resets in 1d6 minutes.
PCs using the real key are allowed passage to 
Region E. Use the following encounter for every door 
that leads to Region F.
B0. LOCKED DOOR
This Encounter is not printed on the Map. Instead, 
anytime a PC attempts to leave the Region through 
doors to the north, read the following:
Before you stands a door. Bound in iron, and 
standing over 10 ft tall it is unlike any door you’ve 
ever seen. The keyhole is a giant griffon head, its 
mouth agape.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This door is locked and cannot be opened 
by any means short of the key in Room C105. Any 
attempt to open it with either the wrong key, a 
Sleight of Hand, or knock triggers a Thunderous 
Glyph of Warding trap (see above). PCs that attempt 
to disable or dispel the trap find that it resets itself 
in 1d6 minutes.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Any attempt to discern the properties of the 
door gives the impression of heavy amounts of 
abjuration magic, a complex (almost unbeatable) 
lock, and a magical trap that triggers when the lock 
is tampered with. The GM is more than welcome 
to assign DCs to the checks necessary to learn this 
information, but it is crucial that they learn it none-
theless. Allow them to spend 30 minutes study-
ing the door.
The door itself is sturdy, made of iron, and with 
hinges mounted on the other side from where 
the party is. The PCs should also realize that a key 
does exist for it (as the tumblers are exact and 
meticulous) and using the wrong key triggers the 
trap as well.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: It is not recommended that you increase or 
decrease the difficulty of this encounter. PCs who 
persist with this lock are asking for trouble. GMs 
should not “kill” the PCs with this trap, but instead 
hint that it can’t be bypassed at the moment.

117
SOME THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND
The PCs should be 3rd or 4th level when they reach this Section of the dungeon. That means even twelve 
goblins won’t be much trouble.
In order to keep the challenge, the GM should try a few things.
One. Give your goblins a significant baseline edge. 
Throw a standing +4 to their initiative roles be-
cause this is their home turf. Add +2 to attacks 
for the well-defended backline in formation. 
Throw in some unexpected weapons scavenged by 
lucky raiders.
Two. Add toughness. What’s wrong with trained gob-
lins having a few extra hit points. It would be worse 
if you gave them extra levels, right?
Three. Add natural armor. A +2 or +4 AC bonus makes 
the goblins tougher but also means that rogues and 
clerics are going to be less useful.
Four. Aid Another. With so many goblins, the Help 
Action really adds up. Don’t be afraid to have a few 
of the goblins extend a helping hand.
Five. Dogpile. Goblins working together to tackle a 
dwarf or human barbarian severely weaken a group 
that’s grown too reliant on the 12 points of damage 
per round 19 Strength, two-handed great greataxe, 
raging, killing machine. Before the barbarian even 
thinks of raging, he’s on the ground, prone and 
weaponless.
Six. Give the goblins the benefit of the doubt. They 
know the PCs are on the move and they know how 
to lure them into traps. Triplines across doorways, 
nearby reinforcements ready to attack from the 
rear, and signal whistles add up to one memorable 
encounter.
Seven. Limit the PCs’ options before they get here. 
Spells like fireball should be limited at this point in 
the campaign, so fighting in tight ranks won’t hurt 
the goblins. Don’t let a wizard with one spell spoil 
your adventures. Plan for it. Build around it.
Eight. Add a hobgoblin to every encounter. While not 
all of them need to be 4th-level fighters, a 1st-level 
fighter at the back of the ranks, directing the action 
and throwing alchemical fire or firing a heavy cross-
bow does more than increase the CR by 1.
Nine. Stagger the assaults. Eventually the barbarian 
tires out. His rage goes away and another wave 
of goblins arrive on the final round of his “energy 
boost.” How did that happen?
Ten: Add Encounter Conditions that we didn’t think 
of. Make the room pitch black in a 5 ft radius or 
add a stench effect (similar to troglodytes) that the 
goblins are immune to (or used to).
GOBLIN TACTICS, OR 20 WAYS TO DIE
Many of the rooms in this Region resemble one an-
other. This is intentional. Once the goblins descend 
on the PCs it is most likely they will be fighting wave 
after wave of reinforcements. And with 25% of the 
goblin population out patrolling at any given time, a 
battle in a hallway or room brings the goblins in the 
adjacent areas down upon the PCs quickly.
And because the goblins have been trained by hob-
goblins, they all carry similar weapons and fight with 
the same tactics. This makes the range of Encounters 
limited. PCs are likely to get bored after the third 
room. This is where the GM comes in.
If played out properly, a single goblin Encounter 
can take up half the evening. By having wave after 
wave of reinforcements pushing into the room, PCs 
are likely to tire quickly. Or at the very least, have 
their patience tested, when the door to the room 
opens for the fourth time with another wave of twelve 
goblins. Worse yet, the first three waves are there just 

118
Eleven. Improvise. Marines don’t plan. They adapt. 
Effective goblin assaults should be no different. If 
the tactics in this book don’t work, change them. 
Have them shore up a weak point, send in a smaller 
goblin to aid with flanks, or carry slings in addition 
to spears to take advantage of the second ranks.
Twelve: Add cool magical effects. Give the goblins 
potions of orc blood (the undercommon version of 
heroism) allowing them to rage for 3 rounds or gain 
+2 Strength for 2d6 rounds. Maybe their weapons 
are coated with a sleep poison or something that 
just deals 1 point on the following round, enough to 
make the PCs nervous. “Hey. They’ve got +1 wound-
ing spears. What gives?”
Thirteen. Make the religion real. The goblin’s faith is 
stronger than anything and thus they benefit from 
spells like guidence and shield of faith, despite the 
lack of clerics. Heck. Add a 1st-level cleric to each 
unit. If you don‘t like clerics, add adepts, druids, or 
sorcerers with access to a domain spell list or grant-
ed power (or both).
Fourteen: Be smart. Don’t let the PC’s lure teams 
of goblins into stupid grease tricks. Anytime the 
PCs are backing up and don’t look injured, trained 
soldiers know that means trouble. The goblins 
should hold back, send for reinforcements, and 
batter the PCs later with some magical assistance or 
brute strength.
Fifteen: Pace the encounters. Don’t let the PCs charge 
from room to room wiping out all the goblins be-
fore they sound the alarm. Lock or bar a few doors. 
Make it tough for the PCs to get into the more 
protected areas.
Sixteen. Give the goblins advantage on all saving 
throws vs. spell effects.
Seventeen. Choose your battles. The goblins don’t 
have to fight the PCs every time. They can lure the 
PCs out of a room and force them to fight in a con-
fined space, where their larger weapons are useless.
Eighteen. Worgs. The goblins have dire wolves, 
howlers, worgs, and yeth hounds at their disposal. 
Give each goblin unit some firepower with a canine 
or lupine companion. Perhaps a blink dog was 
corrupted by the taint of the stables? Perhaps they 
found a destrachan from Region D?
Nineteen. Drop the anvil. Once the PCs are out of 
spells, potions, and wand charges, have the big 
boys show up and make the PCs rely on wits in-
stead of magic.
Twenty. Make the PCs work for it. If the PCs are 
smart about it, they can decimate the entire goblin 
army in less than a week, or become another in the 
long list of victims that have fallen under Haglar’s 
or Hammerfist’s boot. No encounter in this dun-
geon should be “easy.“ Take the next step and show 
the PCs what you’re made of.
to weaken the PCs, using up their magic for the real 
final battle with Goblinbane.
To complicate matters, should the PCs successfully 
beat back everything you throw at them, they’ll need 
to find a place to rest and that patrol or scouting par-
ty is due back any minute, more than ready to go for 
help, should they see the PCs standing knee deep in 
dead goblins. PCs on the run from goblins? Never.
And if word gets back to the goblin king that half 
his army is dead, a worg cavalry unit and a few hob-
goblin bodyguards can be hunting the PCs down in 
no time flat.

B1-B48 . THE ABANDONED  
HALLS OF THE CELESTIALS
Unlike the other Sections of the Region, this initial 
expanse is not lorded over by any one particular 
group. The earthquake damaged this section the 
least, and the celestials that survive in traps and 
puzzles make the goblinoids wary about settling here.
Blink dogs and dire wolves have taken advantage 
of the lack of goblinoids in the area, and many dens 
are scattered throughout these rooms. A few packs of 
howlers prowl the area, though most howlers live in 
the Wild Caverns (Rooms B119 through B133).
The celestials used this Section to study and 
document evil. It was a quiet place for the more 
scholarly angels to note anything unusual about the 
evil and unholy beasts they guarded. Several rooms 
recorded how demons and devils reacted to traps 
and puzzles.
In general, the air is musty. As few things live here, 
the odors of life and death are not as prevalent. While 
the PCs may not have to worry about encountering 
a staggering number of monsters, they need to 
keep their wits sharper than their swords. There is a 
reason the goblinoids merely patrol this Section—
the celestials’ traps are daunting and difficult 
to overcome.
 '
Portcullis Trap. When 15 lbs. of weight are applied 
to the pressure plate on either side of the arch a 
portcullis slams down. Creatures underneath are 
skewered and crushed and must succeed a Dexterity 
saving throw (DC 13) or take 2d8 piercing and 2d8 
bludgeoning damage. Additionally, creatures that 
fail to save are pinned underneath, preventing 
movement until freed. Any creature that can lift 200 
lbs. of weight can reliably lift the gate 1 ft off the 
ground, with the weight requirement doubling for 
each additional foot of distance desired.
While not subtle, the trap still requires active 
attention to notice. Once found the plate can 
simply be stepped over, or disabled by wedging the 
pressure plate.
The pressure plates are clumsy and obvious, only 
requiring a (DC 10) Wisdom (Perception) check to 
spot. Disarming the gate is similarly trivial, only 
requiring a (DC 12) Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check 
to pin the plates in place.

Four blink dogs wander the halls, sniffing

A bugbear sets up a tripwire. He may or may 
not notice the PCs. For the duration of 3d6 
seconds, Wisdom (Perception) checks are 
made at disadvantage, at which point he 
finishes setting up the tripwire.
15
2d4 goblins (half of which ride worgs) patrol 
the Section, looking for anything to report 
back to their king. When the PCs are spotted, 
one rides off for help while the others fight 
defensively to stop the PCs from getting 
further into the Region.

The PCs stumble upon a hallway trapped

20
Bartleby the Halfling (Room B28) is 
crouching behind a wall waiting for a 
small group of 2d4 goblins to pass. He has 
disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
against the PCs until the 2d4 goblins have 
left the area (which takes 2d4 rounds).

120
They are thin enough for non-small PCs to 
simply step across. This trap resets only when the 
knock spell is cast on it, which is a preferred method 
of the celestial caretakers.
 '
Razor Wire. Difficult to spot (DC 14 Wisdom 
(Perception) check) filaments of magically 
sharpened wire are strung haphazardly across the 
hallway. Contact with which causes deep cuts and 
deadly tangling. Each creature caught in the trap 
receives 1d6 slashing damage and must succeed a 
Dexterity saving throw or be tangled.
Tangled creatures take 1d6 slashing damage 
each combat round (or every 6 seconds) and 
another 1d6 if they attempt to free themselves. A 
successful Strength save (DC 11) frees the affected 
creature, ending the effect. Other non-trapped 
creatures may spend an action to attempt to 
free them, requiring a (DC 10) Strength check 
to succeed. On a success or failure, the rescuer 
receives 1d6 slashing damage.
Once spotted disarming requires a trivial (DC 8) 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to sever the wires 
from the wall. The process is lengthy however, 
requiring 20 minutes of work to fully clear. 
Partially cleared (10 minutes of work at least) gives 
advantage on saves made to resist the trap’s effects 
for potential victims.
 '
Tripping Chain. Strung across the path is a thin 
chain. Robust enough to be a tripping hazard, and 
acting as a setup for a much nastier chain. Both 
are simple and crudely concealed (DC 11) Wisdom 
(Perception) required to spot). Stepping on the first 
chain will knock the victim prone unless they pass a 
Dexterity or Strength saving throw (DC 12), wherein 
they must make a second Dexterity saving throw 
(DC 14) to take half damage from falling onto the 
spiked chain.
Creatures that step onto the spiked chain 
receive 2d8 piercing damage as the wicked hooks 
and barbs rend at them. They may also trip from 
this, requiring the same saves as above but done 
with advantage this time. Reduce this damage 
by 1 for every point of AC the creature possesses 
over 12. Creatures that fall onto the chain receive 
an additional 1d8 damage for each size category 
they are above small (medium +1d8, large +2d8, 
huge +3d8).
Outside of adverse circumstances small and tiny 
creatures are not tall enough to fall onto the spiked 
chain and simply faceplant into the flooring.
Disarming the chains requires the removal 
of the interlocking pins that keep them taut and 
tossing them aside. No check is needed once 
spotted. The mechanism isn’t completely intuitive, 
however. Less mechanically inclined PCs might 
require a successful Intelligence (Investigation) 
(DC 10) check to understand.
 '
Burning Hands Trap. Odd pairs of ethereal blue 
hands dot the walls, their gestures queer to those 
not in the know. Magically inclined PCs, or those 
that pass an Intelligence (Arcana) (DC 13) check 
recognize these as somatic spell components frozen 
in time. The spells they would be casting are diverse 
and easily recognizable by those who know the 
spells. A knock here, a commune there; goodberry, 
raise dead, alter self. Of the 30 hands present, all 
save for one are “casting” harmless spells. Any 
Intelligence (Investigation) check by a magic-user 
should yield the above list as suggestions for the 
potential spells they might be casting, with burning 
hands added in if they roll a 13 or greater. Should 
they keep inquiring, simply consult the spell list for 
more harmless spells to have them “casting.” Given 
enough time and prodding the PCs would stumble 
across the burning hands pair.
Creatures that can see magic will see each hand 
enchanted with a faint glow corresponding to their 
assigned spell’s school.
Each pair can be permanently dispelled with a 
dispel magic cast (DC 12).
If you would like the hands to cast their 
associated spells go right ahead, but for now, 
the only pair capable of casting a spell are those 
forming burning hands. Creatures that cross an 
invisible line from between the fingers of the 
burning hands to the opposite wall trigger the 
casting. The burning hands spell is cast at level 1 
targeting the far wall each time the mechanism is 
triggered, resetting after 6 seconds while the hands 
perform the gestures to ready it again.
The mechanism cannot be disarmed with 
physical tools, though a clever rogue might realize 
it can be simply ducked under or triggered with 
objects given some experimentation and/or a 
successful Intelligence (Investigation) (DC 14) check.

THE ARTIFACT
The (doppelganger) goblin king, Argliss, has 
lost a powerful artifact. At some point during 
his rise to power over the goblins, the artifact 
disappeared. While it is not crucial to his 
reign, he does not wish for it to fall into the 
hands of his many enemies and rivals to his 
throne. His new position does not allow him 
to search, but a halfling, Bartleby, is more 
than happy to search for the artifact. He has 
gained the protection of the dominant faction 
in the Region and enjoys enormous freedom. 
He has no plans to turn the artifact over to 
Argliss, however. Anything that powerful is not 
something you give away lightly. Once he has 
found the artifact Bartleby plans to leave the 
Region entirely, using his newfound power as 
he sees fit.
What the artifact is, however, is strictly up 
to the GM. It could be something so truly 
powerful that whoever has possession of it can 
rule the Region, or it could be a red herring 
to draw the PCs’ attention away from the real 
dangers in the Region.
POSSIBLE ARTIFACTS
 
Clay Golem Manual. The ability to craft golems 
gives the PCs a powerful tool for navigating 
the dungeon.
 
Medallion of Thoughts. Reading the thoughts 
and intentions of the more deceitful denizens 
the PCs could prove invaluable to their 
survival.
 
Necklace of Adaptation. Eventually the PCs will 
need to cross the Lake (Region L) and being 
able to breathe underwater might help.
 
Phylactery of Undead Turning. Useful for the 
ghouls and wights found in the later rooms 
of the dungeon.
 
Rod of Cancellation. The PCs are not the only 
group in the dungeon using magical items to 
aid them. The capacity to remove the power 
of their opponents’ items could be key to 
their survival.
POSSIBLE LOCATIONS
 
Room B92, The Maze. With its constant 
dangers, placing the artifact in the maze 
makes for a harrowing quest. Due to the 
goblin’s superstitious fears of the maze, a 
legend has sprung up about a daring thief 
who fled with the king’s treasure into the 
maze, only to be punished by Norendithas 
Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter of 
Foes. The thief in question is eternally trapped 
in the maze, with the goblin king’s treasure 
lost in its confusing, dangerous confines.
 
Room B111, The Killing Grounds. Controlled 
by the undead of the Region, this room is 
a natural place for the artifact to have been 
misplaced. Whoever stole it fled here, only to 
be assaulted by the wights. It could be hiding 
in plain sight amongst the refuse in the room, 
or it could have been buried under the dirt 
floor. Fighting off the ghouls, as well as the 
dangers of the room itself, presents a unique 
challenge to any who seek the artifact here.
 
Room B136, Norendithas Stoneshaper the 
Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes’ Shrine. 
Maybe the wayward hunter-turned-deity stole 
the artifact from the goblin king. If that’s the 
case it has been sealed in the now holy statue. 
Even Argliss would be hesitant to desecrate 
the source of his influence over the goblins in 
an effort to retrieve the artifact. The zealous 
nature of the goblins that guard the shrine 
presents unique issues for would-be treasure 
hunters.
 
Region C. Perhaps somewhere in Region C, 
the artifact has slipped through the hands of 
the goblins and into the clutches of the black 
dragon, giants, gnolls, or chaotic oozes that 
roam the corridors.
In the end, these are merely suggestions. The 
artifact can be anything and anywhere, or 
nothing and nowhere. It is solely up to the GM 
how he wishes to run the campaign.

122
B1. ENTRANCEWAY
This corridor is obviously old, but it is in fairly good 
shape. The air is musty, and a thin layer of dust 
coats the area. The walls are plain and free of mold 
or lichen. It stretches straight ahead for roughly 
30 ft. A second hall joins this corridor roughly 10 ft. 
from the entrance, while the corridor itself turns to 
the left at the end.
Encounter: The hall, while looking nondescript, 
holds the first of the celestials’ traps, as well as a 
secret entrance to Room B3. A successful Wisdom 
(Perception) (DC 15) check reveals a stone door, 
flush with the northern wall. The door is trapped. 
Opening the door triggers the trap; a large double-
bit ax head that swings out towards the hallway. 
Before the door can be fully opened a successful 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 15) check is required 
to unlock it, allowing it to be opened and permitting 
the party to enter Room B3.
Ten feet into the room, where it meets the 
second hall, a pressure-triggered trapdoor awaits. 
It opens into a 10-ft-wide-by-20-ft deep pit filled 
with several sharpened spikes. It is triggered as 
soon as someone steps on the stone floor. Springs 
hidden under the trapdoor reset the trap once it 
is triggered. A Wisdom (Perception) check with a 
roll of 15 or greater alerts the PC’s that the floor 
above the pit has a thinner layer of dust than the 
surrounding area. See below for full trap rules.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the difficulty of this encounter, 
double the depth of the pit and roll 5d10 for the 
ax-trap instead of 2d20. To reduce the difficulty, 
double the amount of temporary hit points granted 
to players caught in the pit trap.
 '
Scything Blade Trap (door mounted). When pried 
open the door easily allows one inch of clearance. 
Doing so reveals the keyhole and arms the spring-
loaded ax. A specific key, which might be found on 
someone important, will disarm the mechanism 
and open the lock. Otherwise, simply picking the 
lock is doable, but results in the door flying free 
on spring-loaded hinges with the ax scything 
into the hallway. Creatures within 5 ft. of the 
door must succeed two separate Dexterity saving 
throws (DC 13).
The first save avoids the swinging door and 
allows them to stay in place. Creatures that fail this 
save take 1d8 bludgeoning damage, knocking the 
creature back 5 ft in any direction, out of the way of 
the axe. If there is no room for the creature they are 
hit and knocked prone instead.
Standing, Medium-sized creatures and above 
that remain within 5 ft of the trap after the door 
springs open must succeed their second save or be 
struck by the swinging ax. Pick the first to be struck 
and roll 2d20. Subtract that target's AC from the 
amount, and deal that much slashing damage to 
them. If more than zero damage is dealt, perform 
this again for each creature in line to be struck 
using the remaining damage instead of the initial 
roll for each subsequent hit. (e.g., GM rolls a 24, the 
first creature struck has 13 AC, they take 11 damage. 
The ax swings through, hitting the next creature 
who has 10 AC, which reduces the remaining 11 
damage they would take down to 1, continuing 
until zero).
To disarm the trap the door must remain locked 
and opened as much as it allows. The mechanism 
can be tripped from the inside with a (DC 13) 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. As the guide pins 
pop loose the axe slams loudly into the closed door 
before the stress on the mechanism ruptures its 
hinges and it clanks worthlessly against the floor.
 '
Spiked Pit Trap. When 15 lbs. or more of weight 
are applied to the 10 ft. wide trap door panel the 
clutch releases, dropping the section on a hinge 
and plunging any creature atop it into a 20-ft 
pit. A feat of Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength 
(Athletics) would be required to mitigate the 
ensuing skewering on the spikes below. Creatures 
will choose which skill to use, and roll the check as 
normal. The resulting roll is gained as temporary 
hit points (representing their heroic attempts to 
grapple with the pit walls and dodge the spikes), 
before they take 3d10 piercing damage, in addition 
to fall damage.
These temporary hit points are lost when 
they exit the pit and stack with other sources of 
temporary hit points.

123
Disabling the trigger requires crossing to the 
far side (a 10 ft, jump) and wedging the hinge with 
something sturdy, which requires a (DC 7) Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand).
B2 . ABANDONED GUARD POST
This room is long and narrow. Toppled benches and 
tables lie in disarray throughout the space. Weapon 
racks stand empty in the western corner. Whoever 
used this room has long since deserted it. The 
dust is thicker in here than in previous rooms and 
you kick it up into the air with every step. Several 
burnt-out torches lie on the floor as well and the 
air has a slightly smoky quality to it. Strange 
carvings line the back wall, and an aged leather 
hide hangs on the eastern wall.
A secret door in the southeast corner can be 
discovered by a successful Wisdom (Perception) 
(DC 15) check. The door’s lock is jammed and requires 
a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 15) check 
to open. The door leads to Room B4.
Encounter Condition: Haunted
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Wedged between two stones in the 
corner of the room is a small tarnished and 
chipped silver dagger. It can be found by PCs who 
roll a 15+ on Wisdom (Perception) checks while 
examining the room.
Scaling: N/A
B3 . OBSERVATORY
The ax swings lazily in the doorway. Stepping 
around it you enter a stark chamber. Along the 
western wall is a table and chair, both built 
of stone. Along the northern wall rests a large 
bookcase. Only a few ancient leather-bound 
books remain on its shelves. Aside from these few 
furnishings, the chamber is empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was built to observe the 
demonic and devilish prisons of this Region. The 
celestials crafted it to be as unobtrusive as possible. 
From here they could freely observe the unholy 
hordes closely. It has been abandoned for quite 
some time.
The leather books remaining are quite fragile. 
Unless the PCs are incredibly careful, the pages 
crumble when handled. Unless one of the PCs is 
fluent in Celestial, the text requires a successful 
Wisdom (Insight) check (DC 18) to translate. Even 
if a PC understands Celestial, the text is in such 
disarray, that another successful Insight check 
(DC 15) to translate is required to make sense of it.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The few remaining journals, if deciphered, 
give the PCs a broad sense of the previous 
inhabitants in this dungeon. They primarily detail 
the demons and devils that were here 2,000 years 
ago. If this is the first the PCs have learned of the 
purpose of the dungeon, allow each person reading 
the tome a single question.
Scaling: N/A
B4 . SECRET ARMORY
The door slides inward, creaking loudly on rusty 
hinges. The interior is dark, but it is not impossible 
to see into the room. The walls are lined with racks 
and racks of simple weapons: spears, clubs, and 
slings. The spearheads are dull, but the dry air has 
prevented them from rusting. Two large barrels 
towards the back of the chamber are filled with 
small rocks, obviously ammunition for the slings. 
Someone is obviously stockpiling weapons for a 
prolonged conflict, and they might be back soon.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears that were formerly 
stationed in Room B2 kept their weapons in this 
hidden storage room. The weapons are crude and 
even a layman can tell they were hastily built.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The room contains two dozen javelins. 
They are of inferior quality, but not to the point 
which causes any meaningful trouble. The two 
barrels, combined, hold roughly 170 lbs. of gravel 
suitable for use as bullets for the three dozen 
slings contained in the armory. The dozen clubs 
found here are not discernable in any way from 
other clubs.
Scaling: N/A

124
B5 . TRAP ROOM
As the PCs approach the door to Room B5, read the 
following.
The corridor wraps around a square structure in 
the center of this room. As you walk around it you 
notice a large stone door set in the center of the 
wall’s western side. The stone of the door is slightly 
darker than the walls and is carved with various 
indecipherable runes.
The door to this room is trapped.
 '
Falling Stone Trap. The trigger to the falling stone 
trap is embedded in the handle of the stone door. 
Attempting to open the stone door by grasping 
the handle causes the handle to pull outwards 
while the door remains shut. After an ominous 
click an enchanted slab of stone, pocked by time 
and use, silently falls. Its immense weight slams 
into anything within 10 feet of the door. Creatures 
must make a Dexterity (DC 14) saving throw or 
take 4d8 bludgeoning damage as they are caught 
underneath. Objects cannot make this save, and 
take double damage. Any that succeed are pushed 
to the edge of the falling block as they scramble out 
of the way. After ten seconds the block raises and 
resets. Opening the door by prying the gap safely 
avoids the crushing. While the door is open the trap 
will not trigger so as to not damage the door itself.
When the PCs enter the room, read the following.
The room is large and empty apart from a pedestal 
resting against the far wall. The floor is tiled in 
dark granite, with a line of polished white marble 
leading from the door to the pedestal. Upon the 
pedestal, there is a golden idol embedded with two 
emerald gems for eyes and a pearl set in its belly.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This is a particularly difficult encounter 
and if the PCs are smart, they will leave before it 
escalates.
The celestials that occupied Room B3 designed 
this room to test the intelligence of the prisoners. It 
contains a series of three traps, each slightly more 
advanced and deadly than the next. The room itself 
is 30 ft. wide by 40 ft long.
The first test is the door to the room. This is the 
most straightforward of the traps.
The second trap is built into the floor of the 
room. The floor tiles are the key to this trap. Each 
tile is 2-ft-by-2-ft The obvious path is straight down 
the middle, following the white marble. Of course 
any path that obvious must be a trap. The celestials 
took this into account. To circumvent this trap the 
PCs must travel down, staying on either side of the 
path, walking a thin line. The white and black tiles 
nearest each other represent the only safe paths 
to the pedestal. The PCs must stay within the 4-ft. 
wide path created by the joined black and white 
tiles. If they stray to either side of these paths, the 
trap triggers, raining metal shards and caltrops on 
the occupants of the room from concealed slots in 
the ceiling.
A successful Wisdom (Perception) (DC 12) check 
reveals the paths are slightly more worn than the 
surrounding tiles while a roll of 16+ reveals the 
nature of the trap.
If the PCs can make it to the idol, they must 
circumvent a third trap to claim the prize. This is 
a simple pressure plate under the idol. If the PCs 
do not disable it before they remove the idol, the 
plate triggers spring-loaded poisoned darts hidden 
behind the eastern wall. Once the PCs have the idol 
they can safely leave the room.
 '
Raining Shards. When the appropriate tile is 
depressed by more than 10 lbs. of force the room-
wide trap triggers. Slots in the ceiling drop metal 
blades onto every inch of the space beneath them. 
No amount of dodging can save those caught in the 
gale of sharpened metal. Creatures within the room 
take 4d10 slashing damage, minus the victim’s AC 
(minimum zero), and an additional 2d10 if they are 
not wearing any head-covering.
Creatures with shields have resistance to the 
damage dealt by this trap.
If a creature is within 5 ft. of another that is at 
least a size larger than them they can attempt a 
Dexterity saving throw (DC 14) to halve the damage. 
This trap fires once per room reset.
 '
Spring-loaded Darts. When half the idol’s weight 
is added to or removed from the pedestal a spray 
of darts snap across the room. Starting from the 
east wall any creature not completely obscured by 

125
another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving 
throw or take 2d8 piercing damage and be poisoned 
until their next long rest.
The trap-holes can be found with a DC 16 
Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled 
with a further DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand). 
Undoing this mechanism leaves the darts open for 
the taking. The first time a dart deals damage it 
loses its poison and poisons the target if they fail a 
Constitution (DC 14) save.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: As soon as the idol passes beyond the 
doorway it instantly turns to dust, the traps reset, 
and the door closes. This was the final test the 
celestials had—to determine if demons would 
continually pursue a futile goal.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
upgrade the spring-loaded darts trap to a fusillade 
of spears trap, increasing the damage dice to d12s. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the damage of 
the raining shards trap to 6d4.
B6 . HALL OF MIRRORS
The floor and walls of this large room are covered 
in mirrors. As soon as you enter, a stone door 
slams down from the ceiling, sealing the entrance 
behind you.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is a single huge trap. With 
every surface covered in mirrors, it is impossible to 
find a way out. The door the PCs entered through 
is sealed and is no longer an exit. Only by finding 
the trap’s trigger and disabling it are the PCs able 
to leave this room. If they cannot, they are trapped 
here until they expire. The trigger is located in 
the northwestern corner, near the floor. A hairline 
crack (DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence 
(Investigation) check to spot) in a mirror is the only 
hint the PCs have to the trigger’s location. The 
crack is actually the edge of a removable panel that 
reveals the trigger. Succeeding a Dexterity (Sleight 
of Hand) check (DC 14) flips the switch and swings 
all four doors open.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase all of the DCs for the hall of mirrors trap by 
+2. To decrease the challenge, decrease the DCs by 
-3 or merely have the door open after 24 hours.
B7 . WATERFALL
This room is rough in appearance. The walls are 
pitted and uneven, as if acid vapor eroded the 
finish. The floor is covered in discs, each two ft. in 
diameter. The discs sit higher than the floor and 
wobble slightly.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The discs in this room are the key to the 
PCs successfully navigating their way across it. They 
are designed to shift and are each mounted on a 
compact spring. The PCs must carefully make their 
way across the room, which requires a successful 
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) (DC 13) 
check. If the PCs stumble, or in any way touch the 
floor under the discs, the trap triggers. The doors to 
the room seal and torrents of water gush into the 
room from slots near the ceiling. The water pours 
in from both the east and west walls. The PCs have 
two minutes to disarm the trap or they drown. 
The release for the trap is located on the center 
of the middle wall requiring a DC 10 Intelligence 
(Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check to 
spot, and requires a successful Strength (Athletics) 
check (DC 12) to pull. Once the trap is disabled the 
water drains through grates under the discs and 
both doors to this room.
Encounter Condition: Extreme Cold, [Flooded]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the difficulty of the encounter, 
players make the Strength (Athletics) check at 
disadvantage when the timer reaches 1 minute 
remaining as the water impedes their attempts to 
pull it. To decrease the difficulty, reduce the DCs to 
spot the lever by 5.

126
B8 . GOLD MINE
The walls of this room are flecked with gold. 
The roughly square room is filled with mounds 
of dirt and rubble. Crude picks, shovels, and the 
bones of several small goblinoids lay scattered 
on the ground. The gold flecks glow and entice 
you forward.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room, while clearly attractive to 
greedy PCs, is as much a trap as anything else 
in the Region. Touching the gold flecks releases 
poison gas into the room. As the door seals them 
in, the PCs have little choice but to disable the trap 
to survive. As long as the PCs do not touch the gold 
flecks, the trap does not trigger. There are no flecks 
on the floor at all.
If the PCs trigger the trap, they have to act 
swiftly to turn it off.
In the middle of the room is a squat stalagmite. 
A successful Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom 
(Perception) (DC 15) reveals a series of three knobby 
buttons. To disable the trap and open the door 
they must be pressed in the correct sequence. One 
attempt may be performed by the PCs each round. 
Each attempt they will roll 3 separate Intelligenc e 
(Investigation) checks (DC 15). Make note of each 
success and failure as a score.
When 3 failures have been noted across multiple 
attempts, reset the scores and start anew. When 
3 successes are recorded the PCs have found the 
correct sequence, the trap disarms, and the door 
opens. If a tie occurs (both hit 3 simultaneously) 
the state with any extra score wins. In the case of a 
perfect tie, reset the round as if they had failed, but 
have the PCs start with one success going into the 
new attempt.
After 24 seconds from the initial triggering 
the gas will start to leave lasting harm. Creatures 
caught in the room must succeed a Constitution 
saving throw (DC 8 + rounds elapsed) or take 
1d6 poison damage for each time they’ve failed 
this save.
Encounter Condition: [Smoke]
Tactics: Once the trap is disarmed (or if it was never 
triggered), the PCs who make Wisdom (Perception) 
or Intelligence (Investigation) checks with a roll of 
17+ notice the transparent outline of angel wings on 
the back wall. Faint and depressed, these grooves 
are used to open the secret door leading to Room 
B13. If a PC you feel would be deemed “good” by 
the virtue locks used by the celestials touches the 
grooves by laying their palms flat, the wall rises up 
and remains open for 5 rounds. The secret door 
cannot be opened from the other side.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the poison gas trap with an insanity mist 
vapor trap. Creatures that fail their Constitution 
saving throw must move toward and take an 
attack action against the nearest creature on their 
next turn, instead of receiving poison damage. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the poison damage 
to a d4 or even a d2.
B9 . DIRE WOLF DEN
As the PCs approach the room, read the following.
As you make your way down the hall, you hear 
heavy breathing coming from behind the door up 
ahead. The air is dank with a discernible odor as if 
something were living here.
Once the door is open, read the following.
Your torches have trouble cutting through the 
darkness in the room. All that you smell is a dank 
odor that clings to everything. From the shadows a 
pair of large wolves rush out, fighting—nipping at 
each other’s heels. Their hackles are raised as they 
would be when fighting for dominance. Turning 
and snapping, the two creatures snarl and lunge, 
attacking wildly.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The PCs have stumbled onto a pair of dire 
wolves that were trapped in this room. They have 
been quarreling for some time, but now happily 
have something new to dominate. They attack the 
PCs on sight, fighting to the death if necessary.
If no one holds the door open, it slams behind 
the PCs. From the inside, the door is locked and 
requires a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
or Strength (Athletics) (DC 17) check to escape. The 
other two doors are not locked, however.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Deep Darkness, 
Fearless, [Stagnant Air]

127
Tactics: Light in this room is reduced to a 5 ft. radius, 
no matter how powerful the source. This puts PCs 
without darkvision at a major disadvantage.
The dire wolves have been trapped here for 
weeks, but do not fight as cohesively as pack 
animals normally do. They do not flank or aid one 
another or use any tactics to gain an advantage over 
an opponent. Instead, they simply choose a target 
and focus their energies solely on them.
If the PCs stumble around in the dark, they can 
find the carcasses of four other wolves littered here. 
Apparently, they turned on each other once they 
were trapped in this room. The two that survived 
were the largest and the strongest.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two dire wolves. To decrease the challenge, 
reduce their hit points by -15 each.
B10 . BUGBEAR REFUGE
As the PCs approach the room, read the following.
A splintered wooden door blocks the entrance to 
this room. From behind it, you can hear a quarrel 
in a foul tongue. Something yells and a loud crash 
reverberates through the halls.
Removing the splintered wooden door without 
making a noise requires succeeding a Dexterity 
(Stealth) check (DC 12+ Bugbear’s Perception 
modifier). A DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check is also 
required to carefully move the door without scraping 
it against the stone walls.
If the PCs remain in the hallway for more than 
10 turns, have the PCs all make Dexterity (Stealth) 
checks. Then, roll a Wisdom (Perception) check for the 
Bugbear, using the lowest Dexterity (Stealth) check 
result as the DC.
If the PCs make a noise in the hall that a bugbear 
notices, the arguing coming from inside the room 
stops immediately. The bugbears take defensive 
positions behind makeshift cover and prepare to 
ambush the PCs as soon as one of the doors is 
pushed ajar.
If the PCs enter without being noticed, read the 
following.
Three furry goblinoids point and shout at one 
another, obviously engaged in a heated debate. The 
creatures are muscular and brutish, each standing 
about seven feet tall. Coarse hair covers their 
bodies and chipped and crooked fangs protrude 
from their snarling mouths. The largest spits as 
he screams at the smallest, who apparently isn’t 
backing down.
All around the room, debris and broken wood 
obscure the stone floor.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Three bugbears have made this room 
their refuge, but have been unable to leave for two 
weeks because of the dire wolves in Room B9. They 
are stir-crazy now and arguing with each other (in 
Common) about who cheated at a dice game that 
obviously isn’t being played.
If surprised, allow the middle bugbear a DC 16 
Wisdom (Perception) check to notice someone 
entering. The largest and smallest bugbears are 
automatically surprised if the PCs enter without 
making any noise.
Encounter Condition: [Ambush], [Cover], Echoes 3, 
Poor Footing 2
Tactics: If an encounter takes place in the room, the 
bugbears swarm the nearest PC, taking a defensive 
position until they have a handle on the situation. 
If the leader drops to zero hit points, flip a coin. 
Heads, the other two surrender. Tails, they become 

128
enraged (Barbarian rage feature, as if they were 
level 3s).
If the encounter takes place in the hall two 
bugbears engage the PCs, forcing them away from 
the entrance to the room, while the smallest runs 
around to the other side of the corridor, to wedge 
the PCs in.
Treasure: Hidden under the debris in this room is a 
small strongbox (Intelligence (Investigation) check, 
DC 18 to locate). The lock is simple and crude, but 
gummed up with grime, requiring a successful 
DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock, 
or DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to smash the 
faulty mechanism and pry the box open. When the 
strongbox is opened, a thin wire running along the 
hinge pushes down, cracking a vial of acid hidden 
inside the box. The bugbears normally open the box 
slowly, preventing the glass from shattering. Allow 
the PC a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 18). If they 
succeed, they hear metal scratching against glass 
and are allowed a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check to stop opening the box before rupturing the 
vial. If the PC makes no intimation that they are 
opening the box slowly, do not allow any checks.
If the vial cracks (which is automatic if the rolls 
fail or the PC is hurried), an alchemical reaction 
occurs and the acid inside, reacting with the 
surrounding air, becomes a fog that blankets a 5 ft. 
square in front of the strongbox. This lasts for 1 
minute and any creature starting their turn, ending 
their turn, or moving through the cloud receives 
2d6 acid damage.
Inside the chest are 46 sp, 24 gp, a dull pearl 
set into a gaudy necklace (25 gp), three healing 
potions, and a wand of light (spend an action to 
cast the light spell without any components, doing 
so costs 1 charge, wand is found with 2d12 charges 
remaining).
The largest bugbear keeps three keys on a ring 
on his belt. The first key goes to the strongbox 
in this room. The second is for the locked door 
leading to Room B12. The third is to the inside of 
the door in Room B9.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one bugbear. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one. These bugbears are considered the 
middle bugbear for the purposes of tactics and the 
encounter.
B11 . COLD IRON
The granite walls are dull and lifeless and the floor 
looks slick with ice. In the middle of the room are 
three pieces of iron, shaped like links in a chain. 
As you approach, the iron links shift position with 
an audible groan. They shudder and with a violent 
screech of metal on metal, finally settle.
If the links are left alone for longer than a minute 
they twist and shift of their own accord, their screech 
taking on an accusatory edge.
After the PCs step into the room, read the 
following.
The door slams behind you though the sound is 
well-masked by the iron links clattering in the room.
Attempts to catch the door require a DC 18 
Strength (Athletics) check to grab it and wrestle the 
door open. Any contact with the door before the 
puzzle is solved triggers a chill touch spell targeted at 
that creature (+7 to hit, 2d8 necrotic damage).
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Another of the puzzle traps placed by 
the celestials, this one is obviously a wrought iron 
riddle to be solved before the door will open.
The center of the three links holds the key to 
the door, but all three will lash out at any who 
approaches. Creatures “attacked” by the links must 
succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC 14) or take 
2d4 bludgeoning damage. The links will target the 
loudest creature in the room, straining to get at 
them even if they are out of reach, with no more 
than one link targeting someone at a time (the 
middle link is pulled around by the other two, and 
thus cannot lash out). The PCs must find a way to 
incapacitate, distract, or otherwise pacify the links 
to get the enchanted key that safely opens the door.
Encounter Condition: Extreme Cold, Fear 12
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the save DCs of the iron link by 5 and 
have it inflict 1d4 extra cold damage for each failed 
saving throw. To decrease the challenge of this 
encounter, decrease the trap DCs by 3 and reduce 
the chill touch effect to a 1st-level caster (+5 to hit, 
1d8 necrotic damage).

129
B12. SNAKE PIT
The southern door to this room is locked and 
requires a successful Dextertiy (Sleight of Hand) 
check (DC 19) to unlock. The door is locked.
The room is 20 feet wide, and 24 feet deep. A wide 
stone ledge is all you have to stand on, as the floor 
of the room drops off twenty feet into an unknown 
emptiness below. The floor writhes as dozens of 
snakes twist amongst sharpened metal spikes.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Having malfunctioned the last time this 
trap was sprung, it has not been reset. A DC 13 
Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the goblinoid 
skeletons scattered beneath the snakes. Unless the 
PCs can reset the trap, they are forced to maneuver 
their way around the edge of the ledge with a 
successful DC 17 Dexterity check.
On the south wall, the PCs see a small stone 
switch with a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If 
the PCs successfully strike the switch (AC 15) with a 
heavy blunt object (like a hammer) a small bridge 
springs out from the wall. Alternately, one PC can 
walk around and merely press the switch with a 
DC 8 Strength check. If the PCs entered from the 
south, then this is a no-brainer.
The bridge extends out at floor level and stops 
10 feet short of the ledge. A successful DC 12 
Strength (Athletics) check enables a PC to land 
on the bridge, but it cannot support more than 
one PC at a time. If a PC leaps onto the bridge 
with someone else standing on it, the bridge has 
a 50% chance of breaking, sending both PCs to 
the bottom of the pit. If a third PC jumps onto the 
bridge it automatically breaks.
PCs on the south side can attempt to repair 
the mechanism that drives the bridge, requiring a 
successful Intelligence (Investigation) and follow up 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (Both DC 15) to 
salvage and replace the faulty gearing. Once fixed 
the bridge extends completely.
Failing the Dexterity check by more than 5 
causes a malfunction and retracts the bridge 5 ft.
Once fixed, the bridge extends all the way to 
the ledge and supports three PCs at a time. From 
here, they can shuffle along the ledge, requiring 
a DC 14 Dexterity check to reach the exit in the 
southeast corner of the room. Since the southern 
door is locked, a PC must succeed at a DC 16 
Dexterity check while trying to unlock the door. The 
mechanism is not overly complex, but the difficulty 
of trying to open the lock as well as maintaining 
balance makes the task difficult.
If the PCs try to pass one another on the 
ledge, everyone involved must succeed at a DC 15 
Dexterity check, +2 per PC. Failure on any balance 
check indicates the PC falls. Failure by more than 10 
means he takes someone else with him.
There is another, less obvious option, for getting 
across this room. five fee below the level of the 
floor, the PCs – with a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) 
check – can discern a groove running along the wall 
of the room. Inside this groove is a 6-in.-thick floor 
that extends across the pit, if the PCs can disable 
the trigger to the trap.
The trigger is located to the left of the entryway, 
where the wall and floor would meet if the trap 
was set. The PCs can find it with a successful DC 22 
Wisdom (Perception) check. A DC 16 Dexterity 
check allows a PC to reach the trigger and two 
consecutive Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) are required 
to reset the trap (DC 14), and then disable it (DC 18). 
Once the floor is back in place, the PCs can walk 
across the room without fail.
If any PCs fall into the pit, their best course of 
action is to climb out. Since the walls are rough and 
provide handholds, the PCs can reach the ledge 
easily with a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If any PCs fall into the pit, six snakes 
(medium vipers) attack each round. While there are 
dozens and dozens of snakes they do not have a 
true strategy and they tend to lash out blindly.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter 
increase Dexterity check DCs by +2 and add 20 ft, 
of depth to the fall. To decrease the challenge, 
decrease all Wisdom (Perception) DCs by -4.

130
B13 . WELL OF SLEEP
If the PCs approach from the hallway, read the 
following.
As you enter this chamber, you see four doors. In 
the southeast corner of the room is a silver door. 
Its shine nearly blinds you. In the southwest comer 
of the small antechamber stands a door of dark 
wood, stained with age. In the northwest corner is 
a simple stone door and in the northeast corner, a 
finely carved stone door catches your eye.
If the PCs entered from Room B8, read the 
following.
The stone door rises, awaiting your entry. As you 
enter the room, the stone door lowers behind you, 
gracefully.
Once the PCs open the door to Room B13, read the 
following.
The room is built with polished stone. The yellow 
hue is as clean as it is even. A simple wooden 
frame hangs above the well, and a frayed rope 
descends into the inky blackness below. Echoes rise 
from the pit, as you hear scurrying noises and a 
splash of water.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room is an enigma. What the 
celestials intended for it is known only to its creator, 
who is dead. It is now the home of a few vermin 
who climb up and down the wall of the pit. From 
time to time the goblins come here as well, hoping 
to catch something to play with.
If the PCs touch the rope, an alarm spell sounds, 
alerting the goblins that someone is here. Allow 
the goblin fighters in Room B70 a DC 14 Wisdom 
(Perception) check. If successful, they come running 
to the commotion in 8d4 seconds, expecting to find 
bugs and rats.
Encounter Condition: [Ambush], Stagnant Air
Tactics: The goblins swarm into the room expecting 
trouble, but instead find the PCs. The goblins suffer 
a -4 penalty to their initiative rolls for 1d4 minutes. 
The goblins gang up in pairs, however, and if any 
PC poses the largest threat, the goblins send their 
“extras” to deal with them.
When the goblins are dispatched the PCs are 
free to gather water from the well to replenish their 
stores, but it needs to be purified before it can be 
safely drunk. If the PCs imbibe the water before 
purifying it they must succeed a Constitution 
saving throw (DC 16) or have their maximum hit 
points reduced by 3d4 until their next long rest.
The secret door leading to Room B8 cannot be 
opened from this side.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the alarm sound when one of the doors is 
opened. To decrease the challenge, the alarm only 
sounds if the rope is pulled.
B14 . OBELISK OF SHAPES
As you enter this chamber, you encounter four 
doors. In the southeast corner of the room is a 
silver door, polished to a nearly blinding shine. In 
the southwest corner of the small antechamber 
stands a dark wood door, stained with age. In the 
northwest corner is a simple stone door, and in the 
northeast corner a finely carved stone door is the 
last to catch your eye.
Once the PCs open the door to Room B14, read the 
following.
The walls of this room are a dull gray granite. The 
floor and ceiling are granite as well, but are highly 
polished. An obsidian obelisk dominates the center 
of the room. Carved into the obelisk are various 
shaped holes—circles, squares, and triangles 
among many others. In a swarm around it spin 
trinkets of varying shapes.
After the PCs step into the room, read the 
following.
The doors to the room slam shut as the shapes on 
the obelisk grind to a halt.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Similar to Room B6, this trap keeps 
the PCs in the room until it is reset. The puzzle is 
simple, meant to test the most basic of problem-
solving skills. Each hole on the obelisk has a shape 
that corresponds with it. Once it is filled the doors 
spring open.

131
Feel free to describe the puzzle in as agonizing 
detail as you like. Lead the players on with the 
depth and complexity of the strangely shaped 
necklaces and baubles that float around.
If someone wants to, they may perform whatever 
checks they deem fit for divining the nature of this 
obelisk. In case someone happens to roll higher than 
a 15 on an Wisdom (Insight) check, clue them in 
on the fact that there are an equal number of holes 
to objects.
The objects themselves are not magical, just 
held aloft with weak enchantments. The obelisk 
itself is not enchanted, instead hiding minuscule 
mechanical switches inside each slot that the 
correct object actuates.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: It is not recommended to increase the 
challenge of this encounter. It is a simple puzzle 
meant to foil creatures with animalistic minds. To 
decrease the challenge, merely have the door open 
after 24 hours.
B15 . BLINK DOG DEN
The stone door in the southeastern corner is jammed, 
requiring a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check to unstick, followed by a successful DC 9 
Strenght (Athletics Check).
Musty odors permeate the air here. The floor is 
littered with bones and scraps of cloth. Near the 
southwestern corner, in front of a large stone door, 
are the bodies of three hounds and a few goblins. 
Broken spears and ruined shields are strewn about 
the floor here as well. In the northeastern corner of 
the room is yet another stone door. This area is free 
of detritus.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: One of many rooms that have been 
taken over as a den by the blink dogs, it was 
recently sacked by a goblin war party. Aside from 
the remains of the battle, there is little of note in 
this room.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4, Distracting Visions
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Amidst the debris, the PCs can find two 
wolf teeth, a very small, jagged gold tooth (from a 
goblin), and a severed, desiccated hand.
Scaling: N/A
B16 . HALL OF THE DIVINE
Constructed of blinding white marble walls, 
and highly polished black granite, this room’s 
southeastern corner is a mess of gears and pulleys. 
The marble wall has been smashed open and the 
innards of a complex trap spill out of it. A huge 
statue of a ferocious angel (obviously female) 
wielding an ornate spear, dominates the wall. The 
statue is masterfully crafted, it’s almost lifelike 
and the spear is real, placed into the right hand of 
the statue.
If the PCs examine the statue, read the following.
At the base of the statue is a plaque that reads, “I 
shall defend this prison against all manner of evil. 
I shall die to protect this world from the horrors of 
the abyss. I shall never waiver. I shall never stop 
my quest to liberate the world from the taint of 
chaos. I shall never concede defeat.”
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Ages ago, when the bugbears were far 
more prominent, they defended this room against 
intruders, considering the beautiful statue a herald 
of what was to come. Little did they know, the 
angel was actually buried in the room, her remains 
used to build the foundation of a shrine to their 
greatest warrior. When any PCs step within 5 ft. of 
the statue, they must succeed a Wisdom saving 
throw (DC 12) or be frightened of the statue for 24 
hours, followed by the summoning of two lantern 
archons, coming out of the eyes of the statue.
They immediately determine the alignment of 
the PCs. Either use the listed alignments on their 
character sheets, or judge for yourself what the 
party’s alignment predominantly leans towards. 
If they are deemed to have strayed too far from 
“lawful” or “good” then the archons summon a 
blink dog to defend the room.
Encounter Condition: Fear 14, Positive Energy
Tactics: The lantern archons are mindless drones, 
created by the spirit of the angel who died here. 

132
The blink dogs are also made of the same celestial 
energy and attack mindlessly. They attack evil PCs 
first, followed by chaotic neutral, neutral, and finally 
chaotic good PCs (of questionable character).
Lawful good, lawful neutral, and neutral good 
PCs cannot harm these creatures. Conversely, 
lawful good PCs are immune to the frightened 
condition in this room. If any PC moves toward 
the statue or touches the spear, the blink dog and 
lantern archons attack them, ignoring alignment.
If the creatures in this room are killed, they fade 
like mist. If you would like, consider any paladin, 
no matter their chosen alignment, to be “lawful” 
alignment given their staunch adherence to their 
oath. An oath-breaker would be exempt for... 
obvious reasons. In fact the archons may judge an 
oath-breaker quite harshly.
Treasure: The statue is armed with a +1 “axiomatic” 
spear. Lawful good PCs can collect it, if they recite 
the sacred oath written at the bottom of the status. 
Should the PC ever fail in this oath, the spear 
disintegrates.
When rolling damage for an axiomatic item, if 
the target is of any chaotic alignment, remove an 
additional 1d4 hit points from that creature. Non-
lawful good PCs touching an axiomatic item suffer 
2d6 lightning damage per turn spent in contact.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
the lantern archons are summoned as soon as the 
PCs enter the room. To decrease the challenge, 
allow any PCs to fight the lantern archons and blink 
dog, but lose their immunity to the frightened 
condition.
B17. TRAPPED BLINK DOGS
As you open the door to this room, a sense of 
unease comes over you. The room is plain and 
square. It is dark, though your torches cut through 
the gloom easily enough. A musky scent wafts 
through the air, and you get the distinct impression 
you are not the only one in this room.
If the PCs enter without being noticed, read this:
Three yellow-brown dogs, nearly identical to the 
corpses in the other room, lie on the floor sleeping 
lazily., They haven’t noticed you yet, but something 
is unnerving them. The dogs shiver quietly with 
fear, whining softly from time to time.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Three blink dogs were driven into this 
room by a goblin scouting party a few weeks ago. 
The room’s Aura of Fear has them trapped.
 '
Aura of Fear. Creatures within the room must 
succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw every 
turn or be frightened of everything outside 
of the room.
If the dogs notice the PCs they immediately 
attack, taking out their frustrations on the party. 
If the party lingers in the doorway, the blink dogs 
have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to 
spot them. If the PCs make enough noise in B15 to 
draw their attention the dogs investigate. Should 
the PCs be spotted then, the blink dogs attack, 
mistaking the PCs for those who trapped them in 
the first place.
If killed, the blink dogs fade like mist.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Fear 16
Tactics: The blink dogs launch themselves at the PCs 
indiscriminately. Where they would normally attack 
the PCs individually—concentrating their attacks—
they lash out at the closest PC. Because of the 
nature of the dungeon, their blink ability is sporadic 
and has a 70% chance of failing. If successful, 
however, they flank the hapless PC. Blink dogs are 
lawful good creatures, and thus are easier to reason 
with using animal handling. If the PCs calm the 
blink dogs, the blink dogs leave the room, but do 
not become companions to the PCs. This ordeal 
has left them a little confused and they move on 
through the dungeon without much direction. If 
the PCs follow, the blink dogs investigate Room B14 
briefly, and then make their way through the rest of 
the Section.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one blink dog. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.

133
B18 . ROOM OF FIRE
The door to this room is locked, requiring a successful 
DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. 
When a PC opens the door they are hit with a wave of 
heat that deals 1d2 points of fire damage. After that, 
the Extreme Heat condition takes effect if the PCs 
enter the room.
This room is hot, close to oppressively so. The walls 
are constructed of granite with large scorch marks 
and stains. The corners contain small piles of ash. 
Against the northern wall, a simple pedestal rests, 
with a scroll case on top.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The oppressive heat is a design of 
the room and should be an indication of the 
inhospitable conditions. While there is no illusion, 
detect magic reveals faint illusion magic on the 
walls and pedestal. This is meant to distract visitors 
and the GM should play up the illusion’s design 
with vague answers to the PC’s questions. Keep 
them in the room as long as possible, examining 
every corner.
With 1d6 minutes of examinations and a 
successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveal 
that no illusion actually exists and the heat is real.
Encounter Condition: Extreme Heat
Tactics: The scroll case is the only thing of interest in 
this room and touching it triggers a fireball trap that 
engulfs the room.
 '
Fireball Trap. When the cap of the scroll case is 
placed upon any surface other than the case itself 
it casts a fireball spell at 3rd level at its location, 
with a spell save DC of 14. Should the trap trigger, 
the scroll case is destroyed, along with the trap, 
and scroll if its still inside. A successful Intelligence 
(Arcana) check (DC 16) reveals the fireball spell’s 
runes etched into the cap’s rim. This trap may be 
disarmed by casting dispel magic on the scroll cap. 
Should the PCs succeed the Intelligence (Arcana)
check by a substantial amount you may opt to reveal 
the exact nature of the trigger, and that the trap and 
case might be saved for later use.
Seventy-two hours after being triggered and 
disintegrating the scroll case manifests again in the 
room, armed, and with a fresh fire trap scroll inside.
Treasure: Coincidentally, the scroll inside the case 
contains a stronger version of this rooms trap, a 
scroll of fire trap.
Fire trap is a variant of the alarm spell, with the 
twist that triggering the associated alarm casts 
the fireball spell at 3rd level at its location, with a 
spell save DC of 14. It requires a successful DC 16 
Wisdom (Perception) check to spot. Succeeding 
a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals the 
magical phrase to disable the fire trap for 5 
minutes. When spoken within earshot, the alarm’s 
trigger cannot activate for that time. Once triggered 
the trap cannot cast fireball again.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the trap and scroll to cast flame strike. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, change 
the trap and scroll to cast burning hands.
B19 . ROOM OF ROT
The door to this room is locked, requiring a 
successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check 
to unlock. When a PC opens the door they are hit 
with a stench of decay that requires succeeding a 
DC 12 Constitution saving throw, lest the PC become 
poisoned. After that, the Stagnant Air condition takes 
effect if the PCs enter the room.
This room reeks of decay. The smell is 
overpowering, practically debilitating and the room 
is cramped. The stone walls are covered in decaying 
moss and dark stains. Across from the door, a 
pedestal stands with an ornate scroll case on it. 
As enticing as the scroll case may seem, the stench 
threatens to completely overwhelm you.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Like Room B18, this room suffers from 
an unexplained odor that chokes the PCs as they 
enter. The stench is actually a design of the room 
(or a malfunction of the magical wards), not residue 
from the trap located on the pedestal. It would be 
easy to say this room is an anomaly, but this entire 
Region plays upon the experimental traps to the 
point that nothing should shock the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: Aside from the Stagnant Air, the PCs also 
have to deal with a trap if they wish to remove the 
scroll case from the room.

134
 '
Noxious Vapor Trap. The scroll case has two caps, 
one on each end. Of the two, one spins freely, as 
if it wants to be opened, popping off easily and 
triggering the trap. The other produces a grinding 
sound when spun and can be depressed as well 
as pulled off. PCs that succeed a DC 10 Wisdom 
(Perception) check hear a soft click when pressing 
down on this cap.
If this cap is depressed while opening the other 
the trap is disarmed permanently. Opening from 
this end still triggers the trap.
Removing the case from the room without 
disarming the trap triggers a noxious vapor that 
floods the room, poisoning any PCs inside that 
fail a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Once 
triggered the scroll case melts into a puddle of goo, 
ruining the scroll if it is still inside. After 72 hours 
have passed since it was triggered the scroll case 
manifests once more on its pedestal, loaded with a 
new scroll.
Treasure: The scroll case contains a scroll of 
stinking cloud.
B20 . LIMESTONE CAVERN
As the PCs approach this room, they can see water 
making out from under the door. The door to this 
room is locked, requiring a successful DC 25 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.
The entire floor of the room is submerged. Looking 
about, you notice the lack of construction here. The 
walls are unfinished limestone and stalactites hang 
from the ceiling. Droplets of water fall from the 
high ceiling, and the walls are slick. Almost floating 
on the water, resting on a stone, is a gem set into 
the wall, pulsating with a bright-yellow glow.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The entire floor of this room is sunken 
and filled with 4 ft. of water, which is icy cold. A 6 
in. lip runs the course of the room, but standing or 
walking on it requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check or the PC 
falls into the water. Falling into the water causes 
no damage, but it is extremely cold. Light does not 
penetrate the water either, but cupping it into one’s 
hand reveals that it is crystal clear. The bottom is 
uneven and rocky, making it difficult to cross easily.
Encounter Condition: [Extreme Cold], Flooded, 
Hazardous Footing 15
Tactics: Touching the jewel casts lightning bolt at 3rd 
level towards the PC. Due to the flooded condition 
of the room, the Dexterity save DC is 16. This 
happens only once, and dispel magic will remove the 
hostile enchantment without harming the item.
Treasure: The gem is a beautifully cut diamond, 
worth about 2,000 gp. While it does not radiate 
magic it grants resistance to cold damage, so long 
as the gem is held tightly in one’s hand. It can be 
safely removed once the trap is disabled.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the lightning bolt spell to chain lightning. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the DC of Dexterity  
save of the lightning bolt trap by 4.
B21 . COLUMNS
The door to this room is locked, requiring a 
successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check 
to unlock.
Stone columns run from floor to ceiling. The 
columns are carved with symbols from an ancient 
language you can’t quite discern, as well as graffiti 
left behind by the vagabond goblinoid races. The 
rapid scrawling of goblins and the heavier script of 
bugbears can be easily discerned. The columns in 
the back of the room are in better condition than 
the ones closest to the door. The floor of the room 
is littered with debris and small rocks.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The carvings on the columns depict 
the story of how the Region was built from the 
perspective of a scholar. It is a signature (of sorts) by 
one of the celestial designers. The graffiti covering 
the columns was created by the goblins and 
bugbears, and in a way details their history, though 
it is difficult to read as they often overlap and 
obscure each other. To ensure the room remained 
a testament to their work, the celestial incorporated 
a trap into the columns. Apparently, the goblinoids 
have not been deterred from spoiling the unique 
architecture of the columns, trap or no. The PCs 
may freely examine the columns, so long as they do 
not touch them. Once a column is touched the trap 
triggers and the columns collapse on the PCs. The 
trap resets once the room is void of life.
 '
Collapsing Columns. While appearing steady, the 
columns are packed with magic and ready to fall at 
any moment. Any touch of a living creature triggers 

135
their descent. Creatures within 5 ft, including the 
offending creature, must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or be struck by the stonework 
launched at them. Creatures that fail their save 
receive 4d8 bludgeoning damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs spend 30 minutes searching the 
debris in this room, allow each of them a DC 17 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to find one of the 
following: 24 copper coins in a brown leather bag, a 
gold ring that radiates illusion magic but produces 
no effect, a masterwork silver dagger, a pair of 
rusted kukri, or a scroll of mending. Once all four 
items are found all the PCs find are pieces of wood, 
bone fragments, stones, and fungus.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have a wall of the room collapse inward instead, 
striking all creatures within 10 ft. of that wall. To 
decrease the challenge, have the column instead 
drop a large brick from the ceiling, only striking the 
triggering creature.
B22 . DIRE WOLF DEN
This room is dark, so dark in fact that your torches 
cannot pierce the gloom. The few things you can 
makeout are merely shadows dancing in the corner. 
The smell of decay fills the air.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The PCs have stumbled into another 
dire wolf den. Four dire wolves are on edge 
due to recent goblin raids, and are prepared for 
any intruders that enter their den. The wolves 
gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, 
attacking the PCs on sight.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Deep 
Darkness, Fearless
Tactics: The wolves use pack tactics, swarming 
over one PC at a time. They do not target any PC 
specifically, attacking whichever is most accessible. 
Two wolves attempt to flank the target, while the 
others assault the PC directly. Attempts to sway 
the animals through Animal Handling are done at 
disadvantage.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two dire wolves. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one dire wolf.
B23 . THE PIT
A deep, circular pit dominates the center of this 
room. Leaning over it, you can see nothing but 
darkness down the treacherous well. The corpse 
of a bugbear lies against the northern wall, a 
gleaming battleaxe clutched loosely in its hand. In 
the other corner of the room, sunk halfway through 
the floor, is a sword. The echo of the wind gushing 
through the pit makes an ominous sound as you 
move cautiously about the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: There are two pits in this room. The first 
is obvious. The second is located directly behind 
the sword; it has become lodged between the two 
sections of the trap’s door. Unless they disable 
the trap first, any PC that steps within 10 ft. of the 
sword triggers the trap and they fall down into 
the 20-ft-deep pit. A successful DC 17 Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check is required 
by any PCs who fall down the pit to escape from it.
PCs that roll higher than a 14 on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks in this room notice seams 
in the floor that a slight breeze wafts through. 
Disabling the hidden pit trap requires sabotaging 
the seams around the edge of it, performed by 
succeeding a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check with the right tools.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The axe the corpse of the bugbear is a +1 
greataxe that always glows with a 5 ft. radius of dim 
light. No effort, physical or magical, succeeds in 
snuffing the light. If the PCs manage to recover the 
sword, it is a bastard sword, with the name Urthieln 
engraved in the blade (in Celestial runes).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the depth of the hidden pit trap to 30 ft. 
To decrease the challenge, lower the DC of the 
climb by -4.

136
B24 . BLOCKED HALL
You see a collapsed door in the distance. It 
appears as if a large stone block fell from the 
ceiling and utterly crushed it. The ceiling, however, 
looks complete and lacks any distinguishing 
characteristics. The hallway branches both east and 
west in front of the door.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The PCs are near one of the celestials’ 
observatories. In order to safeguard their private 
enclosure, the celestials installed a trap here. The 
trap only has one activation left and the goblins 
know to avoid it, having seen its devastating effect 
before. The eastern branch of the corridor leads 
to Room B22. The western branch terminates at 
a blank wall. A DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check reveals a small (3 in. diameter, 3 in. deep) hole 
in the wall (part of a secret door leading to Room 
B25) 4 ft. from the floor.
 '
Falling Block Trap. When the PCs enter this room 
have them roll a Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Anyone who rolls higher than an 8 notices 
primitive markings across the various tiles that 
make up the floor. PCs that roll higher than a 
14, or possess knowledge of goblinoid customs, 
find a pattern amongst them. It is spaced evenly 
enough to be walked by small folk. Straying from 
this path triggers the trap. If the PCs do not find 
the path, each roll 1d6. On a roll of 1-4 they have 
triggered the trap. Triggering the trap causes a 
huge block to fall from the ceiling, crushing any 
PCs who fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw for 6d4 
bludgeoning damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The secret door can only be opened by 
placing a dowel or iron rod into the hole in the 
wall and lifting up. No Strength check is required. 
Without a handle to lift, the PCs must succeed at 
a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check to lift the secret 
door open.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the falling block trap to 6d6. 
To decrease the challenge, lower the damage to 6d3.
B25 . OBSERVATORY
The secret door leading to this room can only be 
opened by placing a 3-in.-diameter dowel or iron 
rod into a hole in the wall 4 ft. high and lifting. No 
Strength check is required. Without a handle to lift, 
the PCs must succeed at a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) 
check to lift the secret door open.
A few nondescript wooden benches are in the 
room. On the back wall a large map hangs limply. It 
looks old, though it is in good repair. The map details 
the layout of this entire section of the dungeon. 
There is a simple stone door to the south.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was used as an observatory 
by the celestials. Aside from the map (see treasure 
below), it contains nothing of much interest or 
value. The air in the room is dry and fire spreads 
easily, consuming the benches and map within 
minutes if the fire cannot be extinguished. The 
door to the south leads to Room B26. It is locked, 
requiring a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
(DC 16) to pick. The doorknob is covered in a thin, 
almost imperceptible, layer of contact poison. It 
must be dealt with if the PCs wish to open the door.
 '
Contact Poison. Touching the poison causes near-
instantaneous burning and vicious nausea. The 
victim loses 1d6 hit points immediately, and must 
succeed a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose 
another 2d6 hit points every 10 hours until their 
next long rest.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The map on the back wall is a duplicate 
of Map B. It can assist the PCs in navigating the 
dungeon. It is quite old, and easily catches fire if 
the PCs are not careful. It is also large, measuring 
10-ft-by-10-ft The map does not show the location 
of secret doors, but it does show the location of 
every room in the dungeon. It is unlabeled.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
raise the DC of the Constitution save of the trap by 
5. To decrease the challenge, reduce the poison’s 
recurring damage to 1d6.

137
B26. OBSERVATORY LIBRARY
As you enter the room you notice it is similar to one 
of the rooms near the dungeon’s entrance. Along the 
back wall is a stone desk and chair, and a bookcase 
covers the eastern wall. In this room, however, the 
bookcase holds a number of tomes, not just one or 
two. A sheaf of papers lies on the desk, and the light 
glints off of something metallic under the chair.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The room is essentially a mirror of 
Room B3. The anteroom (Room B25) served as an 
observation post for the celestials, while this room 
was used to catalog their findings. The catalogued 
observations are stored on the bookshelf, written on 
ancient parchment. Not wishing for their records 
to fall into the wrong hands, this room was trapped 
by the celestial observers. The shiny object under 
the chair, which appears to be a silver brooch, is the 
trigger for a fire trap (see Room B18). Any attempt to 
move the broach triggers the trap, which destroys 
every book in the room beyond any hope of repair; 
the flames easily consume the ancient pages. The 
trap is also triggered if the PCs attempt to remove 
any of the books from the room without first 
disabling the trap.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs do not trigger the trap, they are 
free to take as many books with them as they can 
carry. The books, and the sheaves of paper on the 
desk, chronicle events of the devils over centuries, 
though no specific dates are given. To understand 
the writing, a PC must speak Celestial and succeed 
a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation check). The PCs 
are free to take the silver broach, which is worth 
approximately 100 gp, once the trap is disabled. If 
the trap is triggered, the broach is destroyed in the 
ensuing flames.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the fire trap to cast flame strike at 6th level. 
To decrease the challenge, change the fire trap to 
cast burning hands at 2nd level.
B27. HALL OF VINES
This room is covered in vines, lending it an earthy 
smell. Beneath the plants, you can barely make out 
a series of strange stones. The room is separated 
into three square sections and a layer of ash 
blankets the granite floor tiles. In the center is a thin 
pedestal with a bright gem affixed to it. The pedestal 
has strange sigils carved into its base, though they 
appear worn down and cannot be clearly read. The 
only apparent exit is the door you entered through.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The sigils under the vines, and on the 
pedestal, are glyphs of warding (3rd level, explosive, 
acid). If the PCs touch any wall, or the gem on the 
pedestal, the ward triggers, which withers the vines 
and ivy that have accumulated in the room over 
time. Each wall has its own ward, and each must be 
disabled individually to investigate the sigils.
Encounter Condition: [Safe]
Tactics: There is a secret door in the southwestern 
corner of the room that leads to a corridor which 
leads to Room B29. A successful DC 25 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check reveals a small, rough “button” 
that blends in with the stone. However, a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check dislodges the 
button from the surrounding moss and vines, 
without damaging the mechanism or triggering the 
glyph. Once the button is depressed, the wall slides 
down and into the floor, which also deactivates 
the glyphs for 6d10 seconds before the secret door 
closes again, and the traps reset.
Without the button, disabling any glyph of 
warding here requires a successful Arcana (DC 15) 
check, or just triggering them. The resulting acid-
blast only harms the vines... and the PCs who 
bumble into them.
Treasure: Once the trap on the pedestal is disabled, 
the PCs can remove the gem. It is a small sapphire 
worth approximately 600 gp. A PC spending an hour 
deciphering the sigils on the wall is rewarded a spell 
(that can be transcribed into a spellbook) if they 
succeed a DC 23 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The 
GM should choose an appropriate 3rd-level spell the 
PCs are lacking.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the glyph of warding trap 
to 7d8 acid. To decrease the challenge, lower the 
damage to 4d8 acid

138
B28 . EXCAVATED ROOM
The walls of this room are heavily damaged. Large 
sections of masonry are scattered all over the floor, 
and a few blunt pickaxes are left in the rubble. The 
room is musty and uninviting. 
If the PCs have not killed Bartleby the Halfling, read 
the following:
From the northwestern corner of the room you hear 
grunts and scratching. As you get closer the noises 
stop and the raspy, uninviting voice yells out, “Git 
outta here! This is my claim!”
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Bartleby the Halfling has taken up 
residence in this room. If the PCs have encountered 
him previously, his attitude is Indifferent, though 
he is gruff and suspicious. He presumes the PCs are 
following him, hoping to find the treasure he seeks 
before he can. If the PCs have not encountered 
Bartleby before, he questions them intently, trying 
to determine their purpose in the dungeon. He 
is elusive with his answers, and does not give his 
purpose away. If the PCs do not attack Bartleby, he 
claims the room is empty and has no more secrets 
to be uncovered and leaves, heading towards Room 
B38. He wants nothing to do with the PCs and 
offers no assistance nor accepts any in return. Once 
Bartleby leaves the room, or has been killed, the 
PCs can investigate further. Bartleby has destroyed 
the surface of the walls. The innards of a trap can 
be seen in the northern wall, but it is obvious that 
Bartleby has ruined it beyond repair. A successful 
DC 23 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check reveals the 
trap was once a fire trap (Room B18), but otherwise 
it is unidentifiable. On the southern wall is a 
secret door that leads to Room B29. It is difficult 
to spot, requiring a successful DC 19 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check to find. Like the secret door 
in Room B27, a simple button lowers the door into 
the floor for 2d6 rounds, during which time the trap 
that used to be in this room would be disarmed. 
Despite the damage to the wall, the secret door 
opens easily.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Concealment, Cover
Tactics: Bartleby attempts to scare off the PCs. 
He uses alchemical substances to distract them, 
such as acid, alchemical fire, and thunderstones 
(thrown weapons, dexterity to hit, deals 3d4 acid/
fire/thunder damage to creatures within 5 ft. of 
the target if it hits. DC 12 Dexterity saving throw 
halves the damage). If he cannot drive them from 
the room he flees deeper into the dungeon. Once 
in the dungeon, he heads towards Room B38. He 
knows the dungeon far better than the PCs and 
easily loses them once free of the room. Feel free to 
play this out, however, with Bartleby heading into 
trapped rooms and sneaking through secret doors.
Treasure: Bartleby keeps a bedroll, a small lamp, and 
a few pots and pans. However, any belongings of 
value are on his person.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter 
use the improved versions of Bartleby’s rogue 
abilities listed under “Difficulty Increase.” In 
addition, you may have Bartleby throw his 
alchemical weapons as a bonus action if you’d like.
B29 . THE ROOM OF WANDS
This room’s walls are covered with wands. Each one 
looks masterfully crafted. You can’t see any hooks, 
so magic must be holding the wands to the walls. 
The walls behind the wands are covered with thick, 
green moss. The floor and ceiling are free of the 
moss, and are polished blue marble.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Another in a series of maddening traps 
designed by the celestials, this room only has one 
useful wand: a wand of burning hands. The rest of 
the wands, while nicely crafted, are simple wooden 
decoys with an illusory magic aura. If the PCs cast 
detect magic, everything in the room radiates magic 
and every school of magic is present. PCs who roll 
higher than a 15 on Intelligence (Arcana) checks 
made to study the wands see through the illusory 
magic schools, and discern the wands to be all 
illusion magic. This reveals nothing further about 
them, just that the schools of magic they were 
enchanted with were fake. PCs that touch these 
fake wands who have proven themselves sufficiently 
chaotic or evil (or who bear those alignments if you 
prefer) have bestow curse (spell save DC 14) cast on 
them at 3rd level, choosing a random ability score 
to curse, and lasting for 24 hours.
The true wand is basically impossible to find 
amongst the multitude without testing each one. 
It is up to your discretion for how to handle that. 
Sufficiently stubborn PCs could brute force the 

139
hundreds of wands to find it. If a PC can see magic, 
and succeeds at a DC 15 (21 if they have yet to 
properly discern their spell schools) Intelligence 
(Investigation) check they find the odd one out.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The northern wall contains a secret door that 
leads to Room B28. A Wisdom (Perception) check 
rolls of 17 or greater within the room reveal the well 
hidden door. It is unlocked and opens easily.
Treasure: The PC can retrieve one wand of burning 
hands. It has 1 charge and casts at 3rd level.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
allow PCs to trigger the curse regardless of 
alignment. To decrease the challenge, change the 
bestow curse to bane. The duration and spell save DC 
remain the same.
B30 . GOBLINOID REMAINS
The moment you enter this room you find the 
remains of seven goblins and three bugbears 
littering the floor. From what you can discern, two 
scouting parties encountered each other here and 
laid waste to one another. Broken clubs and spears 
are strewn amongst the corpses and the scent 
of death hangs heady in the air. A bone-chilling 
screech suddenly echoes throughout the halls. 
Something is heading your way.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The scent of death has attracted two 
vargouilles to this room. Roll for initiative, the PCs 
have 24 seconds before they arrive. The PCs can 
choose to lay in wait for the vargouilles or they can 
flee. When the vargouilles arrive they notice PCs 
who are not hiding instantly. They attack the PCs on 
sight, hoping to add to the pile of corpses already 
in the room.
Encounter Condition: Cover
Tactics: The vargouilles assault the PCs with 
diving attacks. They rely heavily on their shriek 
attack, which can paralyze the PCs. They attack 
any paralyzed PCs, using their poison and kiss 
attacks on them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one vargouille. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one vargouille.
B31 . THE ROD IN THE ROCK
A squat stalagmite sits in the center of this coarsely 
carved room. The atmosphere is dank, but not 
overwhelming like some of the other rooms in the 
dungeon. Protruding straight up from the center of 
the stalagmite is a carved staff of dark stained oak. 
The top of the staff is fitted with a gleaming steel 
cap in the shape of an eagle claw.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A quarterstaff is buried in the stalagmite, 
and it serves as the trigger to the room’s trap. 
Pulling the staff before the trap is disarmed triggers 
it, flooding the room with darts that shoot from 
recesses in the wall.
If the PCs disarm the trap, they can attempt 
to remove the quarterstaff; a DC 20 Strength 
(Athletics) check is required to free the quarterstaff 
from its prison. If the PC performing the check 
has proficiency in Animal Handling, they gain 
advantage on the check.
 '
Spring-loaded Darts. When the staff is fully removed 
from the pedestal a spray of darts snap across the 
room. Starting from the east wall any creature not 
completely obscured by another must succeed a 
Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 2d8 piercing 
damage and be poisoned until their next long rest.
The trap-holes can be found with a DC 16 
Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled with 
a DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand). Undoing this 
mechanism leaves the darts open for the taking. 
The first time a dart deals damage it loses its 
poison and poisons the damaged creature if they 
fail a DC 14 Constitution save.
Encounter Condition: [Safe]
Tactics: The only door to this room is a secret door 
that closes 2d6 rounds after it opens. Opening 
the door from this side requires a DC 23 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. This DC increases 
by +5 if the PCs triggered the trap.
Treasure: The staff is indeed magical. A PC that 
retrieves it is the proud owner of a +1 defending 
quarterstaff. Defending items grant +1 AC to their 
wielder while they aren’t wearing armor.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the dart trap’s poison with exhaustion. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the DC for finding 
the trap by -4.

140
B32 . BLINK DOG DEN
As soon as you step into the room you are met 
with a chorus of growls. Four golden dogs, fangs 
bared, stare at you. You have obviously intruded 
upon their home, and you are not welcome here. 
Curiously, they make no move to attack you, as 
they wait for you to exit on your own.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The PCs have entered another blink dog 
den. The blink dogs (hit points 35, 31, 28, 23) do 
not appreciate the PCs’ presence and want them 
out of the room. They bare their fangs and growl 
at the PCs. However, due to their nature, the blink 
dogs do not attack the PCs; they only wish to scare 
them away. If the PCs make no move to leave, the 
blink dogs slowly advance on the PCs, hoping to 
drive them off. If any PCs attack the dogs, they 
immediately retaliate. Successful Wisdom (Animal 
Handling) (DC 14) checks calm the dogs for 2d6 
minutes. Success also allows the PCs to remain and 
investigate the room, though the blink dogs are 
obviously not happy with the PCs’ presence. Failure 
of this check changes the blink dog’s attitude to 
Hostile; they do not like being manipulated. There 
is a secret door on the west wall, leading to Room 
B31. A successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check reveals a hollow stone that can be pried open 
with a successful DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check. Once the hallowed stone is open, the PCs 
can see a lever that must be turned 90 degrees 
clockwise.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If attacked, the blink dogs launch themselves 
at the PCs, focusing on the most aggressive PCs 
first (or in the case of a PC failing a Wisdom 
(Animal Handling) check, they are focused first). 
They concentrate their attacks, targeting one PC at 
a time. They use their blink ability to flank the PCs. 
Because of the nature of the dungeon, their blink 
ability is sporadic and has a 70% chance of failing. If 
successful, however, they flank the hapless PC.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one blink dog. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one blink dog.

141
B33 . BUGBEAR STORE ROOM
This is a simple granite room. Along the northern 
wall is a plain rack, covered with spears and a few 
clubs. The weapons are too large for goblins, or 
smaller creatures, so this is most likely a storeroom 
for the bugbears in the dungeon. The room does not 
seem to have been visited lately, and the hallway 
outside is as quiet as a tomb.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears used this room as a 
makeshift armory for a while. Although they rarely 
come here now, there are spears and greatclubs 
stored on weapon racks. To protect their cache, 
the bugbears have rigged a simple spear trap, 
which is easy enough to spot. Stepping within 5 ft. 
of the weapons rack triggers the trap unless it is 
first disabled.
 '
Crude Spear Trap. Any PC rolling higher than a 12 
on a Wisdom (Perception) check in the room easily 
spots the spears under tension near the rack. These 
spears spring forward if the trigger (a weave of 
wooden poles hidden under a hide on the floor, 
spanning the 5 ft area in-front of the weapon rack) 
is activated. Disarming it is as simple as knocking 
each of the two spears over, where their springs 
worthlessly engage and disarm themselves. PCs 
that fail to notice the spears or charge in heedlessly, 
thus triggering the trap, must succeed a Dexterity 
saving throw (DC 15) or receive 1d8 piercing damage 
per spear remaining.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The PCs have their choice of four 
longspears, two greatclubs, one large warhammer, 
and one shortbow. Upon inspection, the weapons 
are simple and sturdy, but hardly special.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the crude spear trap fire four spears. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the damage of the 
spear trap to 1d4.
B34 . SHRINE OF THE WARRIOR
Moss covers the walls and ceiling of the room. 
Against the eastern wall is a statue of a hobgoblin. 
The statue holds a gleaming short-sword in its 
right hand, and a sharp looking ax in its left. The 
overall pose gives you a sense that this was a 
mighty warrior, and this is hallowed ground.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: As the statue suggests, this room was 
converted into a shrine by the hobgoblins of the 
dungeon. Since the hobgoblins no longer inhabit 
this Section, this room has been abandoned. While 
the weapons are fitted snugly into the statue, they 
can be removed with minimal effort by the PCs. 
This requires a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check for 
each weapon. Any attempt to remove the weapons 
triggers a deafening alarm. But, with no hobgoblins 
in the vicinity, no one responds.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 2
Tactics: After the PCs trigger the alarm in this room, 
roll for two Random Encounters, and resolve them 
soon, but still somewhat apart.
Treasure: The ax in the statue’s left band is 
a +1 battleaxe and the sword in the statue’s right 
hand is a +1 shortsword.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
after the PCs trigger the alarm, roll for three 
Random Encounters, spaced 6d6 seconds apart. To 
decrease the challenge, remove the alarm.

142
B35 . THE PEDESTAL
Brightly polished marble tiles are intricately 
arrayed on the floor of this room. Dark granite 
walls and a high limestone ceiling frame it. A large 
pedestal with a bright red, velvet cushion placed 
upon it, sits majestically in the center of the floor. 
The floor surrounding the pedestal is covered with 
a tile mosaic that depicts a giant snake eating 
its own tail.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whatever purpose this room once served, 
or what the pedestal held, has been lost. The room’s 
defenses, however, are still active. Any PCs that 
touch the pedestal trigger a hail of needles trap.
 '
Hail of Needles. When the pedestal is touched, 
a room-wide trap triggers. Slots in the ceiling 
drop fistfuls of needles into the room. Creatures 
within the room with no way to take cover (shields, 
helmets, nearby larger PCs) receive 1d8 piercing 
damage. From then on, every 5 ft. moved within the 
room deals another 1d4 piercing damage. This trap 
does not reset for a few weeks.
The mechanism can be spotted with a successful 
DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and 
disabled by succeeding a DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Whatever was on the pedestal is no longer 
there, and the pedestal contains no secret 
compartments. Invisible symbols have been drawn 
on the top of the pedestal, however, but these can 
only be found with detect magic (though once seen 
remain visible), which reveals a series of arcane 
marks, laid out in a replicating pattern. A DC 15 
Arcana check reveals that the sigils hint to a riddle 
or answer to a riddle. The PC may study the symbols 
for 1 hour, requiring another DC 20 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check success to maintain concentration 
that long. If successful, the arcane marks explain 
how to open the secret door leading to Room B55.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the hail of needles trap to the raining shards 
trap in Room B5 (with the trigger changed to the 
pedestal). To decrease the challenge, have the trap 
only deal its damage for every 10 ft. of movement.
B36 . WOODEN CAGE
The floor, walls, and ceiling of the room are covered 
with wood paneling. The paneling is smooth and 
even, but the smell of dry rot permeates the air. 
There is no discernable damage, however. Sitting in 
the middle of the room is a burlap sack. Gold coins 
spill out of the top of the sack and litter the floor 
around it. As you make your way towards the sack, 
the door behind you slams shut, sealing you in.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Similar to the Hall of Mirrors (Room B6), 
this room was designed by the celestials as a test of 
the prisoner’s intelligence. A sack, resting on a giant 
pressure-sensitive trigger, serves as bait. Anyone 
who steps within 10 ft. of the sack also steps on 
the trigger, and the trap activates. Once the trap is 
activated the door slams shut and is impossible to 
open without resetting the trap.
The reset mechanism is located behind a 
wooden panel in the northeastern corner. The 
panel must be removed carefully to reset the trap; 
if not, the PCs have another danger to contend 
with. Noxious gasses have built up behind the 
rotting wood and the PCs must take the proper 
precautions when removing the panel, or they’ll 
flood the room with the toxic gas. The panel isn’t 
hard to find. While its purpose is not clear, PCs 
should be made aware of its existence when they 
start searching the room.
When pried open the gases inside burst forth. 
A DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) lets a PC reach 
in and flip the release lever once per hour. Each 
hour the gasses take their toll, dealing 1d8 poison 
damage to all creatures in the room if they fail a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw. PCs reaching for 
the lever take double damage as they get a face full.
When the door opens the gasses quickly vent 
into the hallway and the room becomes safe again.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The sack contains ten vials of holy water, 
which prisoners might find useless but the PCs may 
be able to put to use.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the trap into an acid fog, dealing 2d8 acid 
damage each hour. To decrease the challenge, lower 
the DC of the Constitution save of the trap by -2.

B37 . TRAPPED HOWLERS
As the PCs approach the door to this room, read the 
following.
The stone door in front of you doesn’t look right. 
All the other doors you have seen so far have 
been flush with the surrounding walls. This one, 
however, looks slightly cocked, as if it has been 
jammed shut. Loud whining howls pierce through 
the stone door, flooding the area directly in front 
of it with a cacophonous noise.
If the PCs put their ear to the door, they hear the 
moan of the howlers, forcing them to make DC 12 
Wisdom saves or be frightened of the howlers for 1 
minute. The door to this room has been locked and 
the lock damaged by rough hands. A DC 20 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check is required to open the door. 
After the PCs open the door, read the following.
As you open the door the noise grows louder as a 
pair of beasts jump from the shadows. The beasts 
resemble spiny-backed hounds, which are hard to 
make out due to the thick smoke filling the room. 
Your curiosity is cut short as the beasts lunge in 
your direction.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A party of bugbears has trapped two 
howlers inside the room. They also left a fire 
burning in the center of the room in the hopes of 
suffocating the howlers. Sadly, the bugbears do not 
understand that howlers are not mammals from 
this plane and thus not subjected to the same laws 
for breathing. The howlers have not been trapped 
for long, but they are nevertheless eager to depart. 
As soon as the door is opened they rush in, hoping 
to escape. With the PCs in their way, however, they 
turn their attention to them, violently taking out 
their frustrations on the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Smoke
Tactics: The howlers attack the closest PC first, 
latching on with their jagged teeth. They thrash 
about, impaling the PC on their quills. The howlers 
fight ravenously for 2d4 turns, at which point they 
get their wits about them and fight more sensibly, 
flanking the PCs.
Treasure: Once the PCs have dealt with the howlers 
they are free to inspect the room. Aside from 
scratches on the walls, obviously the work of the 
trapped howlers, there is nothing of note. The wood 
in the center of the room has been smoldering 
for some time, however, blanketing the contents 
in ash. Allow the PCs DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) 
checks to locate a silver dagger, in the corner of the 
room, coated with ash.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one howler. To decrease the challenge, remove 
one howler.
B38 . RUINED OBSERVATORY
The door to this room has been smashed open, its 
remains strewn about the doorway. The interior is 
a now-familiar sight. The room contains a simple 
stone desk and chair, and a bookshelf against the 
back wall. A large pile of books lies in front of the 
shelf. An ear-piercing whine sounds from within the 
pile, and you spot a strange-looking lizard, with a 
triangular head, rifling through the refuse.

144
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room is identical to other celestial 
observatories, the major difference being that 
something has found it and ruined it. The ethereal 
marauder chanced upon the room and is tossing its 
contents, turning over books and chairs.
The ethereal marauder may not notice the PCs 
as they enter the room, busily digging through the 
room’s contents (suffering a -2 penalty to Wisdom 
(Perception) checks). If the PCs remain in the room 
for more than 30 seconds allow the marauder 
another Wisdom (Perception) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the ethereal marauder notices the PCs, it 
becomes startled and attacks. If the PCs attack it 
before it notices them, the ethereal marauder flees 
immediately.
Treasure: The books in this room are ruined. While 
they are mostly journals and textbooks, they offer 
no insight into what the celestials had observed 
from this room. Allow the PCs a DC 25 Intelligence 
(History) check to uncover information about the 
maze in Room B92. If successful the PCs uncover 
details about its twisting, impossible passages and 
the deadly nature of the maze. Despite its dangers, 
demons trying to escape the prison would run 
through the maze, quickly losing their bearings.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one ethereal marauder. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the ethereal marauder’s hit 
points by 5.
B39. HALL OF THE HOBGOBLINS
The door leading to this room is locked, requiring a 
DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock it If 
the check fails by more than 10, roll a d20, on 1-3 the 
thieves’ tools are jammed in the lock and ruined.
Rotted benches and tables fill this cavernous space. 
The floor is littered with scraps of cloth and bone, 
as well as less inviting piles of refuse. Something 
used this room as a meeting place or base of 
operations, but it hasn’t been used in quite some 
time. At the back of the hall, against the northern 
wall, is a large stone throne and dais.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Before the hobgoblins joined forces with 
their goblin cousins, they made their home here. 
While they have long since abandoned this room, 
some of their belongings, shortspears, and clubs 
scattered amongst the refuse and debris, remain. 
They also left behind the throne of their chieftain, 
and it still sits on its dais under a thick layer of dust.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions
Tactics: After the PCs spend 30 minutes in this room, 
roll for a Random Encounter.
Treasure: Hidden in the throne, behind a secret 
panel, is a +1 greatclub. A DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check is required to find the panel, 
while a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check 
opens it. Scattered around the room are twelve 
javelins, two spears, six clubs, 14 arrows, and six 
poisoned arrows (basic poison).
Scaling: N/A
B40. HALLWAY
If you do not want to alert the PCs to the trap in this 
hallway, do not read the following.
You find yourself in a simple hallway. The walls and 
floor are smooth, and nothing is very out of the 
ordinary. Something prickles at the base of your 
neck, however, as things may not be exactly as they 
appear. At the far end of the hallway, you can hear 
a dull, roaring sound, like howling wind.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A well-camouflaged pit lies in wait for 
any PCs traversing this expanse of a hallway. If the 
PCs travel more than halfway through the hall, they 
trigger the trap, falling into the 50 ft. deep pit.
PCs that roll higher than a 14 on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks in this room notice the 
suspicious nature of the floor. Each step is much 
more hollow than usual, the gaps where they 
shouldn’t be, etc. Disabling the trap requires 
wedging the hidden hinges along the sides of the 
walls, by succeeding a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check with the right tools.

145
While intended to be a smooth deathtrap, time 
and nature have worn the pit enough to allow PCs 
to climb out, should they survive the fall.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 10
Tactics: At the east end of the hallway is a spotless 
room. On the west end is an open door leading 
to Room B41.
Treasure: At the bottom of the pit are a few piles of 
broken bones, one of which still clutches 3d6 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
trigger the trap on a failed Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check. To decrease the challenge, reduce the 
pit depth to 30 ft.
B41 . HOWLER DEN
The door to this room is open. If the PCs fell into the 
pit in Room B40, then the howlers hear them coming 
and are not surprised, taking cover in the room. 
Otherwise, the howlers make Wisdom (Perception) 
checks at advantage for the purposes of the PCs 
sneaking up on them.
As you approach the open door, deep growls 
escalate from inside. Something lives here. 
If the PCs succeed at DC 13 Perception checks, read 
the following.
Peeking your head in, you see three hounds, with 
fibrous quills on their backs.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The PCs have entered a howler den, 
although (fortunately) the entire pack is not nearby. 
There are normally as many as ten pack members, 
but presently there are only three howlers. As soon 
as the PCs enter, the howlers unleash their mighty 
howls, wasting no time forcing the PCs from 
their sanctum.
Encounter Condition: Fearless, [Safe]
Tactics: The howlers attack as a pack, lashing out at 
the nearest PC and dragging them to the ground. 
If a PC presents themself as the biggest threat, 
the howlers deal with him first. The howlers bite 
the PCs, latching on with their jagged teeth. Once 
engaged, they use their quills to entangle their 
opponents.
Treasure: A small nest lies in the corner, against a 
stone that is slightly warmer than the others. In 
the nest are the remains of an elf skeleton that 
stumbled into this lair some 5 years ago. The bones 
have been thoroughly gnawed on and the finger 
bones lay about the nest. A golden ring can be 
found in the nest with a successful DC 16 Wisdom 
(Perception check). The ring is worth only about 
25 gp but has the name Ellinorith written on it. 
Ellinorith is an elven deserter and should the PCs 
mention the ring or his name to the elves in Region 
H, they confer that he got what was coming to him.
If the PCs investigate the stone, allow an 
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check (DC 15) check to pull one of the bricks from 
the wall. Some kind of tool will be needed. A thin 
piece of metal works, but shimmying it between 
the mortar takes some time. Once removed, the 
PCs find a piece of amber that gives off heat in a 
5 ft, radius. The heat is around 110 degrees and is 
perfect for putting under a blanket or in the bottom 
of a pot to heat water. The amber never stops 
radiating heat.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one howler. To decrease the challenge, remove 
one howler.
B42 . WELL OF HEALING
The room looks much like the others in this expanse 
of the dungeon but the floor is littered with rubble 
and rocks. At the back of the room is a simple stone 
well. The rope attached to the well’s frame extends 
straight down and is taut.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The well contains a small treasure and 
the room is designed to prevent anyone from 
retrieving it. The rubble on the floor shows the 
aftermath of the trap, and it is the only clue the PCs 
have regarding the nature of the room. The trap is 
triggered when the handle on the well is turned. 
Triggering the trap unleashes stone blocks from the 
ceiling, which fall down on the PCs. The trigger is 
located in the well itself, a discolored stone on the 
backside of the well marks the trigger location.
Triggering the trap causes a huge block to 
fall from the ceiling, crushing any PCs who fail a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw for 6d4 bludgeoning 
damage. This trap resets in 2 minutes.

146
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Once the trap is disarmed, the PCs may 
haul up the bucket attached to the bottom of the 
rope. There is no water in the bucket (as there is no 
water at the bottom of the well), but it does contain 
three vials of shimmering blue liquid. Smart PCs 
should realize this is a great place to store supplies. 
Someone, perhaps Bartleby (Room B28), figured 
out the trap and placed the vials here for future use. 
The PCs should feel confident few people know how 
to get past the trap and can thus store items here 
safely. If the PCs store anything in the bucket, there 
is an 85% chance the items will be here when they 
return. For each week that passes, roll again for 
these items.
Treasure: In the bucket are three vials; each is a 
healing potion.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the falling block trap to 6d6. 
To decrease the challenge, lower the damage to 6d3.
B43. THE MASHER
The floor in this room is scuffed and heavily 
scratched. Aside from that, it is empty, framed by 
unmarked granite walls. Off towards your right is a 
simple wooden door leading to another room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: While the room is empty, it is not without 
its perils. The walls conceal poisoned spikes that 
only trigger when the door to the adjoining room 
is opened. Once triggered the spikes spring out of 
the northern and southern walls, and the northern 
wall slowly moves toward the other. In addition, 
the doors to the south shut and lock, requiring a 
successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 17) check 
to pick. If the PCs trigger the trap it is still possible 
to reset it while it is moving, but the difficulty 
is increased. When the PCs disable the trap or 
manage to get the door open, they can enter the 
adjoining room to the east, which contains the 
remains of a few elves who died in here. The GM 
should feel free to give them a full complement of 
equipment though.
Encounter Condition: Negative Energy, Stagnant Air.
 '
Masher. When the handle to the door to the 
adjoining room is pulled the north and south walls 
sprout 1.5 ft. spikes and begin moving. Both doors 
close and lock if they were not already, sealing the 
PCs in. The mechanism swings with such force 
that any creature caught in the doorway is shoved 
inside. Once the room is sealed the walls slowly 
begin to push together, stopping only when they 
are 3 ft. apart.
A maintenance panel is hidden next to the 
door on the east wall, requiring a successful DC 15 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to find. When 
rolling Perception checks in the room take note of 
any PC that rolls greater than a 12 or 15. Those who 
roll a 15 or greater notice the trap box immediately. 
Similarly, those who roll a 12-14 notice the box, but 
only when the walls start moving. The soft clink 
and hum of gears inside giving the hidden panel’s 
position away.
Disabling the trap is only a matter of jamming 
the gears. PCs may attempt Strength (Athletics) 
(DC 14) with appropriate items to achieve this. 
Succeeding will halt the walls. Alternatively, a 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check may be attempted 
to tamper with the reset timer. The PCs get one try 
at it, taking the roll, reducing it by 5 (10 if the trap is 
in motion), then multiplying it by 3. That amount of 
minutes is taken off the 1 hour reset time.
Touching the spikes at any point deals 2d6 
piercing damage, and poisons creatures who do not 
succeed a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.
If an enterprising PC wishes to test their 
strength against the walls: A contested grapple 
check using Strength (Athletics) is performed 
against the wall. It possesses a strength score of 26, 
adding +13 to its check to contest the grapple. If the 
PC manages to succeed, the wall is halted for 3d10 
minutes, while the reset timer continues to run.
Each grapple attempt applies the spike damage 
twice as the grappler contends with not only the 
mechanism, but the barbs pressing against them.
Encounter Condition: [Negative Energy], 
[Stagnant Air]
Tactics: Once the walls press together, there is a 3 ft. 
gap from one to the other. They remain pressed 
together for 1 hour, during which time the PCs 
must succeed a Constitution save (DC 10, +1 per 

147
previous save) every 10 minutes to stave off the 
strain of balancing, or buckle and lean momentarily 
against the poisoned wall spikes (suffering damage 
each time).
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the trap’s damage by 1d6. To decrease the 
challenge, decrease the trap’s damage to 1d6.
B44. DEAD WORGS
This large room is nearly empty. The walls are black 
and gray, and very clean. However, three massive 
blood-covered wolves lay over the corpses of two dead 
dogs. Blood mats their hair and stains their mouths. 
Their skin is black and much of their hair has been 
singed. The heavy smell of burnt flesh fills the air.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The PCs have stumbled upon a trapped 
room that worgs and dogs were fighting in before 
triggering the fire spray trap. The trap is very potent, 
but with the dead bodies, easy to spot. However, 
if the PCs stumble upon the trigger without being 
careful, they suffer the same fate as the creatures.
 '
Fire Spray Trap. When triggered, a tiny hole in the 
wall flips open and releases a gout of alchemist’s 
fire. A cone of rapidly igniting liquid chars 
everything in its path. Creatures within the room 
must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or 
take 5d6 fire damage. The trap resets in 5 minutes.
Tactics: The trigger for this trap is a single small stone 
set in the floor 6 ft. from the door, shaped like any 
other in the room. Careful PCs can easily avoid 
and disable it by wedging something underneath. 
Wisdom (Perception) checks that roll a 16 or higher 
notice scuff marks on the edges of adjacent stones 
that reveal its ability to move. The corpses are three 
worgs and two blink dogs that fought in this room, 
before one tripped the fire spray trap, killing them 
all. If the PCs clear the air of smoke, avoid the 
trigger (or disable it), and bar the door, the room is 
considered Safe.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
remove the bodies and add an empty backpack in 
the center of the room as a lure. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the damage of the trap to 3d6.
B45. THE GOLDEN IDOL
This large room is lined with bright, shiny steel. 
Light bounces off the steel in every direction, 
blinding you. On columns throughout the room are 
ledges lined with lit candles. In the center of the 
room, on a simple wooden table, is a golden idol. 
The figure is about three feet tall, ornately carved, 
and resembles a beautiful angel, holding aloft a 
torch. The room gives off a peaceful feeling, as if it 
was a shrine at some point.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The idol is a tribute from one celestial 
to another; it honors the celestial’s sacrifices in 
constructing and defending the dungeon complex, 
though this is not readily apparent to the PCs. 
Inscribed on its base is a message (in Celestial). “In 
darkness, I bring light, never straying from my path.” 
Removing the idol from the table triggers a trap.
 '
Chaotic Lightning Trap. Upon a platform sits a 
pedestal, with an idol upon a pressure plate. The 
PCs should be made aware of the plate moving as 
they take the idol unless they rush it. If 35 lbs. (half 
the weight of the idol) is removed from or added 
to the pressure plate under the idol, the trap casts 
a lightning bolt spell at 3rd level at the platform. 
Creatures that fail their saving throw against this 
are knocked prone. Once the spell resolves the 
bolt ricochets off the steel walls 1d4 times, striking 
the PCs once more each time. Prone PCs have 
advantage on Dexterity saving throws to avoid this 
trap, and take no damage on a success. The trap can 
be disabled by correctly weighing down the pressure 
plate. Lawful good PCs (or those you feel exemplify 
the alignment’s values) are immune to the damage 
of this trap.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 5, Positive 
Energy, [Safe]
Tactics: If the PCs extinguish all the candles, the torch 
on the statue lights up, casting the daylight spell 
at 3rd level. This is true anytime the statue is taken 

148
into a dark room. This effect cannot be controlled 
and only turns off when there is a light source 
nearby. This room has an undoubtedly mysterious 
air to it. The GM should feel free to add whatever 
elements are lacking to keep the PCs in this room, 
examining every nook and cranny. If the PCs never 
disturb the idol, the room is considered Safe.
Treasure: The golden idol weighs about 70 lbs., and is 
worth approximately 1,000 gold pieces.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, change the chaos 
lightning trap to cast chain lightning and decrease 
the 1d4 ricochets to 1d2. To decrease the challenge, 
reduce the damage prone PCs take by half.
B46. BUGBEAR FORWARD POST
A crude map of the dungeon, written in rough, 
goblinoid script, is on the southern wall. It marks the 
locations of various rooms, and the rune for goblin 
is repeated over and over on its surface. Standing in 
the center of the room are three tall goblinoids, with 
sharp fangs and heavy coats of fur. They are armed 
and angry, roaring with a defiant battle cry.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The PCs have stumbled upon a secret 
staging area of the bugbears, hidden among the 
trap-infested rooms of this section. Safe from their 
goblin enemies, they plan their attacks from here. 
This room provides easy passage to an expanse of 
claimed rooms (B1 through B45), but also to the 
last remaining bugbear stronghold (rooms B52 
through B68).
The room is currently occupied by three 
bugbears. If the PCs make any sound opening the 
door the bugbears gain advantage on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks. If the PCs go unnoticed allow 
the bugbears a second check after thirty seconds. If 
the bugbears notice the PCs, they become incensed 
by the intrusion and attack.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 2
Tactics: Caught off guard, the bugbears assault the 
PCs ferociously. The bugbears work individually, 
attacking the PC closest to them. While it is possible 
to parlay during battle, the bugbears are more 
concerned with silencing anyone that would report 
this room back to Argliss (Room B75).
Treasure: While there is no treasure, per se, the 
map drawn on the wall can easily be copied onto 
parchment, giving the PCs a much-needed help 
navigating the Region. A door near Room B6, 
to the north, is circled and marked (in Goblin), 
“Kneed Kee.” If the PCs spend an hour transferring 
the map to paper, give them proficiency in 
Dexterity (Stealth, Sleight of Hand), Wisdom 
(Perception), and Inteligence (Investigation) checks 
made anywhere in the Region. This map lacks 
Rooms B55, B57, and B59 through B62. PCs that 
have the map from Room B25 notice this after 
spending 2 hours comparing the two maps; or 
in 1 hour if they succeed at a DC 18 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one bugbear. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.
B47. CHAMBER OF ECHOES
Sounds echo from the walls of this vacant room. 
A series of noises follow giving the impression 
that footsteps are simply more unnatural sounds 
originating from this room. Human wailing 
surrounds you. Hanging from the ceiling is a rusty 
sword tied with a length of rotting rope.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The sword is a trigger for a crawling claw 
trap. If the PCs find a way to remove the sword 
and replace its weight with something else on the 
rope, they can disable the trap. Otherwise, the trap 
triggers as soon as the PCs lower the sword.
 '
Crawling Claw Trap. The trap is the rope itself. 
Enchanted with necromancy, it brims with latent 
magic, dying to be unleashed. It glows with a pale 
light when viewed by those with magical sight. It 
otherwise presents as mundane. Removing the 
sword without tying another object to the rope 
triggers the trap. Once triggered, 2d4 crawling 
claws burrow out from under the various stones, 
each echoing the alien sounds as they attack.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Echoes 10
Tactics: No sounds actually originate from this room, 
but instead are amplified from other Regions in the 

149
dungeon. This room has become a nexus for noise 
and the PCs are actually hearing conversations and 
battles going on in Regions E, G, I, and N.
Treasure: The sword is a featherweight longsword 
that needs to be cleaned and sharpened but 
otherwise has survived the ravages of age. The word 
“sanctify” is written along the blade in Celestial. 
Featherweight weapons weigh half that of weapons 
of the same type (in this case longswords), gain 
thrown (range 20/60), and use their versatile 
damage dice even when wielded with one hand.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add 1d4 crawling claws to the trap. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, halve the number of 
crawling claws created by the trap.
B48. RIDDLE ROOM
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 15 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open.
Along the western wall of this room is an immense 
red tapestry, covered in silver and black arcane 
sigils, The cloth is silk, and in perfect condition as if 
untouched by the passage of time. On the floor are 
a series of tiles: white stones, mixed with red bricks 
and onyx plates. On the south wall is a strange 
diagram showing the layout of the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is a complex puzzle requiring 
the PCs to make some intelligent decisions. 
ln order to reach the tapestry, the PCs must 
successfully navigate the tiles. The tiles are laid 
out thusly:
The diagram on the wall is wrong, designed to 
encourage interlopers to miss the order in which 
they stand on the tiles. PCs succeeding at a DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check or DC 15 Wisdom 
(Insight) check are able to read the notes and 
decipher them accordingly.
According to the diagram, the PCs must step on 
the tiles in the order:
White. Red, Black, Red, Black,  
White, Red, Black, Black, White.
This of course is wrong and only if the PCs 
succeed at a DC 28 Wisdom (Insight) check 
or a DC 25 Wisdom (Survival) check can they 
determine the pattern is illogical and based on their 
knowledge of traps a trick. While this does not help 
them determine the actual order they know the 
diagram is incorrect.
In actuality, it doesn't matter what color they first 
stand on, but once a tile is touched, only that tile 
color should be stepped on (by that PC) from that 
point on. Reaching each stone of that color without 
touching any other stone requires succeeding a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, unless the PC chose 
the red bricks which are narrower and require 
successful DC 18 Dexterity saving thows. If a PC 
takes the shortest route, they can clear the room 
in six jumps, reaching the tapestry on the other 
side. Longer routes take up to ten jumps, but all of 
them lead to a single 3-ft-wide bronze plate on the 
floor. The plate, which is below the tapestry is safe 
for the PCs to stand on, no matter what color tile 
they chose.
Encounter Condition: [Poor Footing 3]
Tactics: If the PCs step on the wrong tile, they suffer 
a small discharge of energy from the tile based on 
the color of a tile. 
Stepping on a red tile out of turn, reduces the 
PC's speed by 5 ft. until their next long rest.
Stepping on a white tile out of turn deals 1d4 
fire damage.
Stepping on a black tile out of turn poisons the 
PC unless they succeed on a DC 13 Constitution 
saving throw.
Treasure: Although it radiates no magic of any 
kind, if the tapestry is pulled from the wall and 
wrapped around a humanoid, it forms into a +1 
ghostly scale-mail, which permanently fuses to the 
wielder's body. It is not uncomfortable, able to 
be slept in and worn with little issue. Its ghostly 
nature makes it practically weightless. Anything 
short of dispel evil and good (break enchantment), 
or the wish spell, cannot remove the armor. 
Despite its weightlessness, it is quite loud and 
still manages to restrict movement, inflicting all 
the penaltieswearing scale mail would. wearing

B49-B68 . THE BUGBEAR ENCAMPMENTS
For centuries, the bugbears dominated the other 
goblinoids in the Region. Neither the goblins nor the 
hobgoblins could match the ferocious attacks and 
cunning tactics of the bugbears. Where once their 
domain was extensive, the alliance of the goblins and 
remaining hobgoblins, coupled with the zealous new 
outlook the goblins wield, has driven the bugbears 
back to these few rooms in the western section of 
the Region.
During their reign of dominance, the bugbears 
spent a fair amount of time dismantling many of 
the celestials’ traps. They took advantage of the 
damage the earthquake did to the Region. 
A few of the more complex traps were left 
standing, as the bugbears could simply not 
fathom how to disable them. The de-
stroyed traps have been replaced by sim-
pler ones of the bugbears’ design, which 
they can reset and modify as they see fit.
The intimate knowledge and ever-changing 
array of traps have kept the bugbears safe in 
this domain, their final refuge. The tactics and 
numbers of their enemies may thwart them in 
the rest of the Region, but here on their home 
turf, they control the field and eagerly look 
forward to the day the goblin empire topples 
and they can reclaim their former greatness.
It is possible, however unlikely, for the PCs 
to gain the trust of the bugbears and ally 
themselves with them against the goblins and 
hobgoblins. This is quite difficult to accomplish 
as the bugbears view the PCs as yet another 
faction vying for power in the Region. If the 
PCs can gain the trust of the bugbears, they 
gain allies who know the Region very well and 
have the power to make the PCs’ trek through 
the Region much easier. The simplest way 
to gain the bugbear’s trust is to show them 
the bodies of slain goblins. Deeds, not words, 
have the best chance of swaying the bug-
bears here.
There are surprisingly few bugbears in these 
encampments. Many are off on sorties against the 
goblin empire. The few that remain plan new raids 
and repair the traps they have laid for the goblins.
If the bugbears believe the PCs are allied with 
the goblins, however, they will not give the PCs any 
chance to prove otherwise.
the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, the armor fades into a red mist and reappears on this wall as a 
tapestry again.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, the penalty for red tiles should stack 3 times. The penalty 
for white tiles should have its damage increased to 1d8. And the penalty for the black tile should inflict 
exhaustion instead of poison.

D20encounter
1
This section of the dungeon is unnerving. It could be the air, or the shadows, or the way the sound 
plays off the walls, but something about this area is disturbing. [Haunted].
2
The sound of heavy footfalls echoes throughout the dungeon. A group of bugbears are out hunting 
goblins, or anything else invading their space. The PCs must succeed at three DC 14 “Stealth” checks. 
These are not normal Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and are not contested rolls. If the PCs choose to 
spend extra time by not moving from where they are, they should have advantage on these checks, 
and should not suffer armor disadvantage. If they fail any of the checks, they encounter the bugbears, 
as if a 19 had been rolled on this table.
3-12Nothing.
13
A stone block falls from the ceiling, striking a random PC for 4d6 bludgeoning damage unless they 
pass a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Allow one PC a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 17) to spot the 
brick before it has a chance to harm anyone.
14
A pack of 1d4+2 worgs wander the dungeon. They are not hunting the PCs, and have only a 25% 
chance of noticing them. If the PCs do not wish to confront the worgs, they must succeed at a 
DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid being noticed. If the PCs elect to stop for a time, grant them 
advantage on those checks, and remove armor disadvantage for them.
15
A pair of bugbears are resetting a scything blade trap (see room B1). The PCs notice the bugbears first 
if any roll higher than a 15 on a Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the bugbears get the drop on 
them. Whichever side loses this is surprised.
16
See 13, but instead of falling of their own accord the stone pieces are attached to a tripwire. 
Depending on the party’s formation more than one party member can be hit. The blocks now strike 
1d4 party members and deal 6d6 of damage on a failed saving throw.
17
A group of three ethereal marauders turn the corner and face the PCs. They are startled by the PCs’ 
presence. They have a 50% chance of fleeing outright. Otherwise, they are Unfriendly to the PCs 
unless attacked.
18
The PCs chance upon a violent skirmish between the bugbears and goblins down the hall. 3d6 
goblins are engaged in furious combat with 2d4+1 bugbears. One of the goblins spots the PCs and 
both groups strike out and turn their attention to the PCs.
19
The noises of the PCs have attracted the attention of a nearby bugbear patrol. Impose a -2 penalty on 
the PCs’ Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the bugbears before they attack. The party is made up 
of 2d4+1 bugbears armed with short spears and swords. Aughkin (Room B62) leads the patrol.
20
Bartleby (Room B29) is inspecting a portion of the wall here. He seems intent on his work and 
doesn’t look up as the PCs arrive. Bartleby suffers a -4 penalty to his Wisdom (Perception) checks for 
30 seconds.
B49. SANCTUM
The door to this room was locked, requiring a 
Dexterity Sleight of Hand check (DC 19) to pick open.
This hidden room is in good repair. A simple desk 
and chair, and a large oak bookcase are the only 
furnishings. The desk is empty, but a number of small 
bottles are scattered over the shelves of the bookcase.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears never discovered the secret 
door in Room B51. They don’t know this place exists, 
leaving it free from their stench. Surprisingly, there 
are no traps or enchantments here, and Wisdom 
(Perception) checks of 15+ give an overwhelming 
confidence that the room is free of danger.

152
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: Used as a sanctum years ago, the room is a 
perfect hiding place for the PCs. The time it takes to 
complete short or long rests here is halved, owing 
to the surprising comfort... or perhaps some celes-
tial enchantments.
Treasure: N/A

B50. SECRET CHAMBER
As the PCs near the secret door on the eastern wall of 
Room B59, read the following.
A sliver of light spills out into the hallway from a 
crack in the wall.
As the PCs near the secret door on the western wall 
of Room B50, read the following.
A sliver of yellow light spills out into the hallway 
from a crack in the wall. Grunting sounds can be 
heard from behind it.
Finding the secret door requires a DC 15 Intelli-
gence (Investigation) check and a DC 15 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to slide it open. A small, 
rough stone doubles as a handle, allowing the PCs 
to simply lift the door open. The secret door on 
the western wall is jammed and requires a DC 14 
Strength (Athletics) check in addition to the Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check.
As the PCs enter the room, read the following.
An oddly shaped room opens. In the middle of 
the room, set into the northern wall, is a stone 
door. The room contains no furnishings other 
than a stack of four strongboxes, one on top of 
the other. Wherever the sound was coming from is 
gone for now.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is more of a causeway, used 
by the celestials to shuffle about behind the scenes. 
There is nothing here to explore (except the strong-
boxes), but opening the doors could prove a chal-
lenge to the PCs.
This room contains three hidden doors. Which-
ever one the PCs came through stays open for 2d6 
seconds before closing. After that, they can easily 
find and open the door again.
The door on the northeastern wall leads to 
Room B49 and requires a DC 25 Investigation check 
to find and a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check to open. The same is true of opening it from 
the other side. This secret door remains open for 
2d6 seconds.
The secret door on the southeastern wall leads 
to a long corridor and the secret door on the west-
ern wall opens into a north-south corridor (that 
leads to either Room B52 or B53). Finding either 
secret door requires a DC 20 Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) check and a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check to slide it open. A small, rough stone 
doubles as a handle, allowing the PCs to merely lift 
the door open.
The secret door on the western wall can easi-
ly be found from the inside but requires a DC 14 
Athletics check to open in addition to the Sleight of 
Hand check.
The door to the north is locked (from both sides) 
and requires a DC 22 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check to open. The small interior chamber leads to 
another, similar locked door that is also locked on 
both sides.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 6, Safe
Tactics: The sounds the PCs heard were the dungeon 
playing tricks on their ears. There is no one here, 
but when the doors are closed and the PCs stand 
just outside it seems like there is.
Treasure: All four boxes are equally weighted and 
none make any sound when shaken. The third 
strongbox, however, is the only one with anything 
in it. All four are locked.
Each strongbox requires a DC 27 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to open and each lock 
is trapped with a poison needle trap. If anything 
except a key is inserted, the needle springs forth, 
jabbing the intruder. Victims that fail a DC 13 
Dexterity saving throw take 2d8 poison damage and 
must succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or 
be poisoned. They are easy to spot and should only 
get the most careless of thieves. The mechanism 
will not reset automatically once fired.
In the third box, strapped to the inside of the lid, 
are five potions: healing (x2), resistance, sanctuary, 
and gaseous form.

B51. PRIVATE STUDY
The door leading to this room is locked, requiring a 
DC 27 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to pick.
This is a simply furnished room, with a small cot 
and a table. A tattered pillow and blanket rest on 
the cot, and both reek of mold and mildew. Upon 
the table is a shiny, gold ring and a hefty book.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Before the doppelganger Argliss took over 
the goblin empire, he made this room his home. 
Well hidden, it proved a solid base of operations 
to fall back to. While he spent years living here, he 
never returned after becoming king. Knowing his 
journal was safe, he left the room as it was, hoping 
one day to trap something with his ruse.
The ring on the table is rigged to explode, con-
suming the book in a blaze and harming those who 
trespass. It is rigged with a fire trap (Room B18).
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: If the PCs disable the trap on the ring (a hefty 
task), the ring and the book are theirs. The book is 
Argliss’ journal. It details his encounters with the 
halfling Bartleby (room B28). The doppelganger 
is quite upset with the loss of the artifact Bartleby 
seeks. Bartleby is allowed to keep any other artifacts 
he finds in the Region as payment, provided the 
artifact is returned to Argliss.
While it does not say anywhere in the journal 
that Argliss is a doppelganger, it does allude to 
strange circumstances where he is not always a 
goblin. Allow the PCs a DC 15 Intelligence (Histo-
ry) check or a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check 
to deduce he is a barghest. If they succeed at a 
DC 21 History check or a DC 25 Intelligence (Na-
ture) check, they realize he is not a barghest, but a 
doppelganger. The GM should make these checks 
secretly so the PCs don’t know whose informa-
tion to trust.
Treasure: The last page of the journal is a scroll of fire-
ball. The ring radiates strong transmutation magic 
and appears to be a ring of invisibility if the PCs cast 
identify on it. It is actually a cursed ring with several 
side effects. First, it causes the wearer to automat-
ically fail saving throws against the scry spell. In 
addition, the wearer can never turn invisible, no 
matter the strength of the spell. It also causes the 
wearer to be constantly under the effect of a zone 
of truth. Lastly, while the wearer’s alignment does 
not change, they cannot willingly violate any lawful 
good tenets, including killing innocents, betraying 
a trust, or deceiving a fellow man. While they don’t 
have to always behave “lawful good”, they do have 
to monitor more obvious actions. This powerful 
magic item was here when Argliss moved in and he 
never put it on, for fear of the celestial’s games.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the Investigation DC of the fire trap by +5. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the Intelligence 
(Arcana) DC of the fire trap by -5.
B52. STRAY DIRE WOLF
You hear a low, deep growl as you approach an 
open chamber ahead. A wandering dire wolf 
stalks the hallways, its hackles raised. It snarls 
at you, baring its fangs menacingly from the 
darkness ahead.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A lone dire wolf roams the hallways, 
apparently lost. It has been here for some time and 
grows more agitated as the hours roll on. When the 
PCs enter the room, the wolf attacks.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Fearless
Tactics: This dire wolf is fast and agile. Having 
roamed these halls for some time, it is worked up. 
The dire wolf gains the effects of the Mobility and 
Alert feats. In combat, it attacks the closest PC and 
continues attacking until it is subdued or the PCs 
are dead. It trips PCs on each attack, moving onto 
the next PC, once one is down. If two PCs are down 
at the same time, it takes a round to bite a prone 
PC before moving on. Wisdom (Animal Han-
dling) checks involving the beast are performed at 
disadvantage.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one dire wolf. To decrease the challenge, re-
move the benefit of the Alert and Mobility feats.

B53 . THE RESERVOIR
Towards the back of this large room is a low, 
circular well. The well’s placement is reminiscent of 
a town square fountain. The principle difference is 
that the well has no discernable bottom. In front of 
the well is a small sack with gems spilling out of it.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whatever the original purpose of the 
room was has been lost. Now, the bugbears use 
this room to dispose of captured goblins and other 
creatures, having placed the gems here to lure 
goblin patrols. Lifting the sack triggers the pres-
sure-sensitive plate (which can be noticed by rolling 
higher than a 15 on a Wisdom (Perception) check) 
underneath. When triggered, the door to the room 
seals and it rapidly floods to a depth of about 4 ft. 
This is ultimately harmless, but after 3 minutes the 
room begins to drain. 
PCs must succeed two consecutive DC 14 
Strength (Athletics) checks or be sucked down the 
50 ft. drop into the well. The trip is rough and deals 
2d6 bludgeoning damage as they strike the walls 
on the way down. Climbing out is difficult but not 
impossible, requiring a successful DC 17 Strength 
(Athletics) check to perform well, otherwise they 
incur a level of exhaustion. Enterprising PCs might 
trigger the trap again to force a stuck PC out.
The door to the room has a stubborn seal that 
can be defeated with a wedge of some variety and 
a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics), or a DC 18 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Unsealing the 
flooded room drains its contents into the nearby 
area and breaks its mechanism for good.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the room’s drain timer from 3 minutes to 
6d20 seconds. This is rolled each time the room is 
triggered. To decrease the challenge, reduce the DC 
of the Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) checks by -5.
B54 THE BUGBEAR PACK 
LEADERS' HALL
This massive room is furnished with hides and 
skulls, trophies of a more prosperous time for the 
bugbears. The walls are rough, and covered in crude 
runes and hairline cracks. The floor is stained badly, 
and littered with scraps of bone. In the middle of 
the room is a squat, wide table with a large map 
placed on it. Around the room are four bugbears. 
The largest snarls at you and reaches for his club.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Unless the PCs have spoken with Aughkin 
(Room B62) the three bugbears in this room attack 
the PCs without hesitation. If the PCs have spoken 
with Aughkin, the bugbears’ initial attitude is Un-
friendly instead and they do not attack the PCs.
While the bugbears’ attitude is Unfriendly, the 
PCs can negotiate with them, deferring to their 
leader, Sharpfang. Sharpfang is particularly ornery 
and pays the barest amount of lip service to Augh-
kin’s “presumed” status within the encampment. 
He humors the PCs to increase his own stature and 
gain respect from his fellow bugbears.
His knowledge is limited to the goblin and 
bugbear war. Sharpfang does not give the PCs 
any insights about traps or what to expect in the 
dungeons. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Insight) 
check reveals that Sharpfang does not care if the 
PCs fall victim to the traps in the dungeon or not. 
He could give the PCs valuable information, but he 
chooses not to.
Sharpfang and his raiding party created the map 
on the table. It details the bugbear encampment 
and the goblin empire (Rooms B52 to B91). While 
it’s marked with dots and splotches, the placement 
is incomprehensible to the PCs. Only Sharpfang is 
sure what the markings mean, and he refuses to tell 
them. If the PCs call him on this refusal to help, he 
gets angry. If they continue to push, he attacks.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: Sharpfang attacks the strongest PC, while his 
subordinates watch his flank, striking any PCs who 
get near him.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one bugbear. To decrease the challenge, 
remove two.

155
B55. A BLACK PEARL?
The secret door leading to this has not been found in 
centuries. The PCs must succeed at a DC 25 Intelli-
gence (Investigation) check to find this secret door. 
It is completely flush with the stone and even if they 
know it’s there, they only gain advantage to locate the 
groove in the wall. If successful they pry open a 4 ft. 
wide door that allows access to the room.
This room is cramped due to a large pedestal that 
takes up the center of the room. The top of the 
pedestal is covered in black velvet. Nestled in the 
center of the velvet is a single, flat black stone. 
Oddly, there is no dust in the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: If the PCs aren’t paranoid about the traps 
in this Region, they haven’t tried hard enough. 
Chances are they believe the stone is trapped, 
seeing it resting on a pedestal, unguarded. In fact, 
it is not. The PCs merely need to walk up and lift 
the stone from the pedestal. But they don’t have to 
know that.
Encounter Condition: [Drafty]
Tactics: If the door to this room is left ajar, it creates 
a draft that sweeps through, threatening to blow 
out torches.
Treasure: The pearl on the pedestal is actually a bead 
of force. It lacks the ability to trap creatures inside its 
radius, instead dealing an extra 8d8 radiant damage 
on impact.
Scaling: N/A
B56. THE BUGBEARS' WORKSHOP
A large workbench stretches along the northern 
wall. Tools lie haphazardly on top of and 
underneath it. Shelves lying against the western 
wall contain scraps of iron, brass, and copper. Off 
in a corner of the room are piles of leather and rope.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whether it is a new spear or a piece of 
a deadly trap, if the bugbears need it they make it 
in this room. The tools are hanGMade and crude, 
but they serve their purpose. The bugbears are not 
master craftsmen by any means, but they do good 
work and their cunning in devising traps has served 
them well. At the moment, the room is empty, but 
the bugbears in Room B57 are busy at work.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 2
Tactics: If the PCs succeed at DC 21 Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks, they hear grunts coming from the 
other side of the wall. While the secret door here is 
not obvious, there is enough of a gap for sound to 
come through.
The secret door leads to Room B57 and requires 
a DC 21 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find. 
It does not appear on the map in Room B25 and 
therefore the PCs do not get a bonus to find it. If 
the PCs make a great deal of noise, allow the bug-
bears in Room B57 Wisdom (Perception) checks to 
notice them.
Treasure: The workshop contains scraps of iron, 
brass, and copper as well as multiple shafts of 
wood. There is also a small pile of leather and rope. 
The tools themselves are worthless, simple things 
made for large hands.
Scaling: N/A

156
B57 . THE BUGBEARS' ARMORY
This room serves as the armory. Aside from the 
various weapons that adorn the racks and shelves 
in this room, you can’t help but notice a group of 
surly goblinoids, seven feet tall, and covered in fur. 
They are sorting through scrounged debris and piles 
of stones, as they look up to see you.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Unlike the majority of rooms in their 
domain, the armory of the bugbears is not aban-
doned. Three bugbears have just returned from a 
patrol and are sorting through some of the supplies 
they’ve scrounged (rope, wood, etc.). They do not 
take kindly to intrusions, especially in one of their 
hidden caches. If they do not hear or see the PCs 
coming, they are surprised, but ready for battle 
nonetheless.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The bugbears attack the closest PCs, and 
stay in a tight group. They use their size to their 
advantage and do everything they can to push the 
fight into the hall. Weak PCs are easy targets and 
the bugbears hurl whatever they can find at pesky 
spellcasters who launch spells from the back of 
the party.
Treasure: The armory contains a dozen short spears, 
three long spears, six short swords, eight great-
clubs, and an assortment of rope, stones, wire, 
wood, and anything else they could manage 
to scrounge.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add two bugbears. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.
B58 . SUPPLY ROOM
Empty barrels and empty shelves fill this room; 
a supply depot, in serious need of supplies by all 
appearances. Only scraps of iron and leather, and a 
few sticks, are currently in stock.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears store spare parts for their 
traps, as well as additional supplies for making 
weapons here. The current lack of supplies indicates 
how bad off the bugbears currently are in their 
campaign against the goblins.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The supply room contains scraps of iron 
and leather, as well as a few bundles of short sticks 
that could possibly be used for spears.
Scaling: N/A
B59 . SLEEPING QUARTERS
Various animal hides and blankets cover the floor. 
You get the impression this is a communal sleeping 
room for the remaining bugbears. The room feels 
safe and secure, and you can understand why the 
bugbears chose it. Fortunately for you, it is deserted 
at present.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears, when not out raiding, re-
treat here to rest. They have claimed a great number 
of safe rooms in their small domain, and use them 
to their advantage. Other than the animal hides 
covering the floor, this room is empty.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The animal hides on the floor could possi-
bly be used for barter, or the PC’s own personal use. 
Aside from those, the room holds no treasure.
Scaling: N/A
B60 . ENTRANCEWAY TO THE 
INNER SANCTUM
The secret door can be found by the PCs with a DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check. While the door is 
secret, it is also locked. Opening the secret door re-
quires a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to manipu-
late the hidden mechanism. Alternatively, the PCs can 
use Aughkin’s (Room B62) key, which requires them 
to encounter him as a Random Encounter.
Fine, almost powdery, rubble litters the floor of this 
room. Along the west wall are three separate doors. 
Based on the contents, it’s safe to assume this is a 
storeroom for the inhabitants of the dungeon.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears have utilized the resources 
left behind by the celestials well. They survive the 

157
vicious goblin attacks mainly because their guerrilla 
tactics and cunning make them hard to find. The 
lock on the secret door makes it more difficult still 
even for knowing goblins to enter. The bugbears’ 
private quarters are located off of this room. Even 
with the protection of a secret entrance, the bug-
bears take no chances. The rubble strewn about the 
floor of this room should tip off the PCs to another 
bugbear trap. Among the rubble is strung a web of 
tripwires. Triggering one drops a stone block from 
the ceiling, striking the offending PC for 4d6 blud-
geoning damage unless they pass a DC 14 Dexterity 
saving throw. A successful Wisdom (Perception) 
check (DC 17) to spot the tripwires.
Encounter Condition: Hazardous Footing 14
Tactics: If the PCs make too much noise here, roll for 
a Random Encounter.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the damage of stone blocks from the 
ceiling trap to 5d8. To decrease the challenge, lower 
the damage to 4d3
B61 . THE HEALER
This room seems out of place. While other rooms in 
this stretch of the dungeon are either wide, empty 
halls or small, cramped cells, this room is... cozy. 
A large goblinoid sits placidly in the center of the 
room, adding to the overall strangeness of the 
scene. His hair is white, perhaps from age, and his 
manner is calm and unobtrusive.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: This bugbear, known only as Healer, is 
quiet, serene, and imposing. Standing a full 7 ft. 
high, Healer is white-haired and appears very wise. 
The Healer is not typical of the bugbears by any 
means. He has lived long enough to understand 
that war between the goblinoid tribes is unneces-
sary, but an irrefutable fact of their heritage. He has 
resigned himself to seclusion.
He couldn’t care less about the PCs’ presence, 
but helps them out—giving them medicinal herbs 
to heal their wounds—if asked. The Healer does 
not “waste” magical healing on the PCs unless 
the PCs have proven themselves to be stoic allies 
of the bugbears first. He reserves his magic for 
his comrades, unsure of when the goblins could 
attack next.
The PCs can ask Healer about the bugbears; he 
answers their questions to the best of his abilities. 
He is tired of the war and simply wishes to be left 
undisturbed in his sanctuary. If the PCs are in the 
room for more than one hour, the Healer starts to 
get agitated and his attitude shifts from Indifferent 
to Unfriendly.
The Healer never attacks the PCs first. If the 
PCs attack him, however, he will do his best to 
subdue them.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 2, Safe
Tactics: The Healer calls upon his deity to protect him 
from the PCs, alternating between casting spells 
and attacking the nearest PC with his +1 morning-
star. He casts entropic ward before a fight breaks out 
and calm emotions once things get heated.
Treasure: The medicinal herbs Healer carries heal 
1d4+1 hit points each and he has enough medicine 
to make 2d12 doses for the PCs.
B62 . THE RETIRED PACK LEADER
Cramped and reeking of rotten meat, this small 
room is dominated by an aging goblinoid. Even 
seated, you can tell he is well over seven feet tall 
and a mass of fibrous muscles waiting to snap. His 
hair is gray and mottled, and deep scars line the 
bugbear’s face, chest, and hands.
If the PCs do not surprise the bugbear, add the 
following.
Staring at you from his perch, his one good eye 
searches deeply, curious about you. He seems to be 
having the same trouble reading you as you have 
reading him.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The creature in this room is a bugbear 
named Aughkin. He is old and of no use in raid-
ing parties. However, he has lived a long time, an 
indication of intelligence to this bugbear tribe. The 
others keep him here and rely on his wisdom and 
stories of past adventures to help plan bolder raids 
into the goblin expanses. While he would rather be 
in the thick of a raiding party, he is content to guide 

158
the younger bugbears to victory over the accursed 
goblins. He does not advise in matters he consid-
ers suicide, and whether the true leader or not, 
still treats his “men” with the dignity and respect 
due soldiers.
With a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check, 
the PCs can convince Aughkin they are not here 
to harm him or the bugbears. Aughkin and Heal-
er (room B61) are willing to hear the PCs out and 
perhaps reach an agreement, but this requires 
roleplaying, not die rolling, and ultimately is the 
decision of the GM. Should they reach an accord, 
word spreads amongst the bugbears that the 
PCs can be trusted and the two groups should 
work together.
If attacked, or enraged, Aughkin attacks the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: Aughkin would rather not fight, but he is not 
afraid of death. He has become a good advisor by 
thinking before he acts. If forced into battle, Augh-
kin does not hesitate, however. He launches himself 
at the PCs with a ferocity rarely seen in bugbears 
half his age. He gains the benefit of the barbarian’s 
Rage feature for the duration of combat, despite 
not being a barbarian, and grapples the nearest PC 
he can find. If he gets a PC on the ground, Aughkin 
grabs ahold of the PC’s neck and threatens to snap 
it if the others do not back off. Because of the size 
of Aughkin’s hands, he deals 1d4+1 bludgeoning 
damage each turn while successfully grappling.
Treasure: Aughkin does not keep anything in his 
chambers that does not serve him in warfare. 
Clothing and magical aid are given to his men and 
for himself, he’s kept a simple +1 dagger. If the PCs 
spend 30 minutes searching the room they manage 
to find an old journal (written in Goblin) that tells of 
his younger days as a soldier, and his recent years 
as a leader, unwilling to jeopardize his men.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two bugbears. To decrease the challenge, have 
Aughkin surrender if his grapple fails.
B63 . GOTCHA!
Stark, this room is nearly identical to many rooms 
in the dungeon. The one feature that distinguishes 
it however is an intricate pattern of tiles on the 
floor. The tiles are covered in a layer of dust, 
however, and it is difficult to discern anything 
specific about them. Hanging on the wall, across 
from you, is a finely crafted spear.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears like to capture the occa-
sional goblin, as they sometimes prove to be reli-
able sources of information. While the rest of the 
traps the bugbears have laid out in their domain are 
lethal, this room is not. Any goblins captured in this 
room are brought to Room B53 for interrogation.
The tiles on the floor are the trap’s trigger, an 
alternating black and white pattern (like a checker-
board). PCs stepping on black tiles trigger a large 
net trap while stepping on white tiles is safe. To 
disable the trap the PCs must find a specific black 
tile in the southwest corner of the room where 
the trap’s reset is located. Finding the tile is easy 
enough, requiring a successful Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) (DC 14) check. However, lifting the tile and 
disarming the trap is another issue entirely. There 
are a series of twelve buttons, in three different 
colors (black, red, white) that must be depressed in 
a specific order. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) check indicates that the buttons must 
be pressed in pairs. Failure on this check indicates 
that the colors are directly related to the tiles on 
the floor.
A second DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check indicates that the buttons must be pressed in 
order—red, black, and white. Failure on this check 
indicates the order is black, white, and red.
Lastly, the PCs are allowed a third check (this 
time at a DC 20) to determine the exact pairs that 
need to be depressed. If the PCs fail this check, they 
choose the wrong pair.
If a button is ever pressed out of order (or 
pressed in correspondence to the incorrect pair), 
the PC triggers a cantrip targeting the but-
ton-presser based on the color. The black button 
triggers a chill touch, the red button triggers fire 
bolt, and the white button shocking grasp. The can-
trips are cast as if by a 1st level.

159
 '
Large Net Trap. When triggered a room-wide net 
made of bundled wire descends from the ceil-
ing, catching all beneath it. PCs must succeed an 
Strength (Athletics) check (with a DC equal to their 
AC) for every 10 ft they wish to move underneath it. 
If the trap is disabled while it is active the net rises 
once more.
If more than 2 hours pass after the net is trig-
gered a patrol of 1d3 bugbears investigates.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs succeeding at a DC 20 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check realize that the mechanism for protect-
ing the large net is more complicated than the net 
itself, hinting that at one time the trap was more 
than just a net. Once the trap is disabled, the room 
is safe until the bugbears reset it (in 2d6 hours). It 
is recommended that the GM make the checks in 
private, lest the PCs get wise to the trap’s function.
Treasure: The spear is a featherweight spear. It is the 
bait by which all goblins are tricked into entering 
this room. PCs that lifted the special black tile are 
allowed Wisdom (Perception) (DC 16) checks. Those 
who succeed realize that the buttons are built into 
a locking hinge that hides a compartment under-
neath. If they successfully disable all three traps, 
they can lift the mechanism (requires succeeding 
a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check) to find a pair of 
magical daggers. One of the daggers is an angel-
bane dagger, while the other is a fairybane dagger.
Angelbane weapons are +2 and magical when 
used against creatures that speak Celestial. Fairy-
bane daggers are +2 and magical when used against 
creatures that understand Sylvan.
Featherweight weapons weigh half that of 
weapons bearing the same type, gain thrown (range 
20/60), and use their versatile damage dice even 
when wielded with one hand.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the large net trap to a camouflaged pit trap 
(Room B40). To decrease the challenge, change the 
large net trap to a portcullis trap.
 '
Portcullis Trap. When triggered a portcullis slams 
down in front of the exit. Creatures underneath are 
skewered and crushed and must succeed a Dexter-
ity saving throw (DC 13) or take 2d8 piercing and 
2d8 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, creatures 
that fail to save are pinned underneath, preventing 
movement until freed. Any creature that can lift 200 
lbs. of weight can reliably lift the gate 1 ft. off the 
ground, with the weight requirement doubling for 
each additional foot of distance desired. The gate 
will rise when the trap is reset.
B64 . A LONG WAY DOWN
This simple chamber is quite nondescript, except for 
a pair of high-quality long spears abandoned in the 
center of the room. Two gems, in the opposite wall, 
stare back at you, like a pair of red eyes.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Like Room B63, the bugbears set up a 
simple pit trap to snare goblin scouts. The long 
spears have been left to lure the unsuspecting 
goblins into a trap. If that doesn’t work, the gems 
in the wall will. The floor beneath the long spears 
(5-ft-by-5-ft square) can only support 10 lbs. before 
it opens, dropping the victim(s) into the 60 ft pit 
below if they fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A 
locking mechanism can be found, with a successful 
Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 15), behind a 
panel in the eastern wall. Once the switch is flipped, 
the doors to the pit do not open and the PCs can 
travel across the room safely.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The gems are only painted glass, designed 
to lure goblins across the room. They cannot be 
removed from the wall, short of a DC 30 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check. If removed, the bugbears 
replace them in 1d3 days. This trap is either an 
indication that bugbears aren’t very inventive or that 
goblins aren’t hard to trick.
Treasure: The two spears are normal spears, which 
the PCs are free to take once they have circumvent-
ed the trap. The gems are worthless glass.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the depth of the pit trap by 20 ft. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the depth of the pit 
trap by 20 ft.

160
B65. STORAGE
The door to this room is locked. A DC 25 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check is required to unlock it. 
The smell of death inside is evident before the PCs 
open the door.
As soon as you open the door, the smell of death 
assaults you. This small room has a pile of dead 
goblins, who are rotting. Flies and maggots fill the 
air, escaping past the PCs and into the open air. 
Stacked along the walls are all manner of wood 
beams, spikes, polearms, and tripwires.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is filled with the tools and 
equipment for making traps (not to mention a 
half-dozen dead goblins). It looks as though it is 
regularly used, but how the bugbears endure the 
stench is another story.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (mindfire) 12, 
Stagnant Air
Tactics: While mindfire is normally inhaled, if the PCs 
avoid touching the goblins, they gain advantage on 
the Constitution saves to resist the mindfire.
Treasure: If the PCs have the stomach for it, they can 
search the dead bodies, finding a total of 36 sp, 
14 cp, a key to the door in Room B80, and a po-
tion of jump.
Scaling: N/A
B66. BUGBEAR HIDEOUT
The door to this room is locked, requiring DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.
Unless the PCs succeed at a DC 25 Dexterity 
(Stealth) check while opening the lock, read the 
following:
This room is enormous. The vaulted ceiling and 
painted walls make this room appear larger than 
life. Standing, weapons at the ready, are eight tall, 
angry, grizzled goblinoids covered in mottled brown 
fur, their jagged teeth exposed.
If the PCs succeed in picking the lock quietly, read 
the following.
This room is enormous. The vaulted ceiling and 
painted walls make this room appear larger than 
life. Pacing about the room, sharpening weapons, 
and sifting through crates are eight tall, grizzly 
goblinoids covered in mottled fur, their jagged teeth 
exposed. They do not notice you.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly or Hostile
Encounter: Eight bugbears are using this room 
to plan a raid on the goblins. Normally, they are 
mobilized, moving about the halls, but these bug-
bears have a plan up their sleeves. They intend to 
gather their strength together, sneak through the 
maze (Room B92), and attack the sleeping goblin 
army from behind. By striking from the far end of 
the goblin empire, they hope to distract the main 
arm of the army and send a smaller force to kill 
the goblin king. If the bugbears do not notice the 
PCs, they continue planning their attack. However, 
every so often, allow one of them a Wisdom (Per-
ception) check to notice the PCs. If the PCs watch 
for too long, the bugbears assume they are spies 
and attack. If the PCs approach peacefully, however, 
there is an opportunity to work with the bugbears. 
Allow the PCs to role-play through the situation or 
use Wisdom (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) 
to diffuse the hostilities.
If attacked, or enraged, Oskin attacks the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: If the PCs try to strike a bargain with the 
bugbears, Oskin (the largest of the eight) listens 
to what the PCs have to say and, if he trusts them, 
invites them to help on the raid, asking them to 
attack from the north while they use the maze to 
disguise their approach. In combat, the bugbears 
fight to silence the PCs. Two rush to block the door, 
while the rest flank the PCs. Oskin directs the battle 
for two rounds before attacking the largest PC. 
They are tireless fighters and have no qualms about 
killing the PCs.
Treasure: All of the bugbears carry well-crafted weap-
ons and are prepared for battle. Oskin carries two 
potions of healing and a potion of the giant’s strength.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two bugbears. To decrease the challenge, 
remove two.

161
B67. THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE
This room is large and appears empty, but 
something about it bristles with menace. There 
are no signs of the goblins occupying this room, 
so it must still be in the domain of the bugbears. 
Why they have chosen to leave it empty is a 
mystery, however.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The bugbears have littered this room with 
as many traps as possible. If the goblins seek to take 
their final hidden refuge (Room B68), the bugbears 
plan on exacting a heavy toll.
Scattered around the room are six different 
traps, each placed in such a way that the PCs cannot 
avoid them all if they move between the doors on 
the western and northeastern walls. The GM is free 
to trigger as many or as few of the following traps 
as he likes.
The basic arrow and spear traps occur three times 
throughout the room and the dart traps occur twice.
 '
Spear Trap. Running perpendicular to the walls are 
3 spear traps with simple 5-ft. wide tripwires placed 
in their line of fire. Each launches its payload at the 
unfortunate PC who triggers it, dealing 1d8 damage 
if they fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Should 
they succeed, the next PC that would be behind 
them must succeed the save or be struck instead. 
Disarming it is as simple as knocking it over, where 
the tension will be undone safely.
 '
Poisoned Darts. Tiny clusters of darts sit loaded 
into a pair of crude launchers in each of the far 
corners of the room. When their awkwardly strewn 
triggers are depressed a spray of darts snap across 
the room. Starting from the east wall, in a 15-ft. 
cone pointing towards the center of the room, any 
creature not completely obscured by another must 
succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 1d6 
piercing damage and be poisoned until their next 
long rest.
The launchers can be found with a DC 13 In-
telligence (Investigation) check, and disabled with 
a further DC 9 Sleight of Hand check. Failing the 
check launches the darts. Undoing this mechanism 
leaves the darts open for the taking. The first time 
a dart deals damage it loses its poison and poisons 
the damaged creature if they fail a Constitution 
(DC 14) save.
 '
Swinging Block. Directly in the center of the room 
is a single 10-ft. tripwire that can be noticed if a 
PC rolls higher than a 14 on an Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) check. Triggering the trap causes a heavy 
stone block to swing towards the trigger’s location, 
requiring a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid. 
Failure to do so deals 3d8 bludgeoning damage. 
If the save succeeds, any creature occupying that 
space in the next few seconds must save again or 
take 2d8 bludgeoning damage as the block swings 
back through. This repeats once more, with one less 
damage die.
 '
Arrow Trap. Pointed randomly about the room are 3 
arrow traps. Within their line of fire are numerous 
crossed and web-like triggers. They are obvious, 
intentionally so, painted with bright colors. To navi-
gate their zone of fire PCs must succeed an Dexter-
ity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check (DC 15). 
No traps have triggers that intersect these as they 
are meant to drive victims into the range of the less 
obvious traps. Failure to avoid the trigger requires 
a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 1d6 
piercing damage. Disarming any of these traps 
requires simply knocking it over.
Tactics: The object of this room is to introduce the 
PCs to the traps of the Region. The bugbears are 
not likely to invite strangers in and this room is 
designed to encourage PCs to find another way 
in. Getting to Room B68, the PCs find it a dead-
end and now have to move across the room again. 
Unless 1d4 hours have passed since they moved 
through this room, the bugbears have not reset 
this trap.
Unlike other trapped rooms in this section, 
there are no dead goblins here. If the PCs enter this 
room from the secret door to the south, it is not as 
important to “hurt” the PCs with this room, since 
they are more than aware of the region’s dangers. It 
is recommended the PCs feel discouraged, but are 
not killed by this room.
The door to the south leads to a secret door that 
requires a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
to locate. The secret door is locked, but a simple 
DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check allows the 
PCs to spin the door open on its central axis.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, allow two traps to 
go off at the same time. To decrease the challenge, 
have each trap occur only once.

162
B68. REFUGE
Lined with empty supply racks, this room feels safe 
and secure. Currently, there is nothing in the room 
aside from the empty shelves.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: If the goblins ever overrun the bugbear 
encampments, the bugbears plan to fall back to this 
room. Guarded by the traps in Room B67, they can 
wage a war of attrition against the goblins to the 
very end. They know that if things become this dire 
they are doomed, but they plan on taking as many 
goblins as they can with them.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: If the PCs admit to the bugbears that they 
have entered the refuge, it shifts their attitude one 
step closer to Hostile. Once Hostile, the bugbears 
attack the PCs on sight in all future encounters, 
having spread the word.
Treasure: There are a few daggers, arrows, and the 
like, but nothing of value. Allow the PCs to resupply 
up to 1d20 arrows, bolts, darts, and 1d6 spears.
Scaling: N/A

163
B69-B91 . THE HOLY GOBLIN EMPIRE
These rooms encompass the might of the goblin em-
pire that has recently been forged by their new king, 
Argliss in the name of their new god.
Musty smells and dampness unknown in the rest 
of the dungeon fill the air here. The traps laid by the 
celestials still work, and the goblins learned long ago 
to avoid the rooms that contain them.
From these rooms, the goblins have unleashed a 
vicious war of conquest and retribution against the 
bugbears and rebel goblin faction. Had the hobgob-
lins not accepted the offer to join Argliss, no doubt 
they too would have felt the goblins’ wrath.
If the PCs have allied themselves with the bugbears 
(Rooms B51-B68), they will have a difficult time con-
cealing their activities from the goblins. The goblins 
are highly suspicious of newcomers and attack any 
on sight. Only a command from their king stays their 
hand. Argliss does not give the PCs free passage if 
he has any reason to believe that the PCs have allied 
themselves with any group other than his fledg-
ling empire.
Bugbears occasionally enter the goblin empire to 
wreak havoc. If the PCs have allied themselves with 
the bugbears and do not assist them here, word gets 
back and any inroads the PCs have with the bugbears 
are shattered.

164
B69 . THE SENTRIES
Most likely, the goblins spot the PCs long before they 
spot the goblins. If for some reason they do not and 
sneak up on the patrol, read the following.
The hallway stretches before you, a group of 
goblins stands guard. They are strangely well 
organized, and well equipped. Each came with a 
short spear and buckler, methodically patrolling the 
hallway moving about 10 feet in each direction.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A patrol has been stationed here to 
prevent bugbears from entering the empire by the 
most obvious route. Due to their darkvision, they 
can see enemies coming and due to the darkness 
of the halls, they are more than likely to see PC 
torches. As a result, the six goblin fighters who 
rotate their patrol with the goblins in Room B70 
prepare to ambush the PCs, sending for reinforce-
ments while they wait inside the various nearby 
hiding places.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Cover
Tactics: As soon as the goblins spot the PCs, they take 
up defensive positions in the nearby halls, while the 
smallest two run to Room B70 for reinforcements. 
Depending on how the PCs approach, they either 
wait for the PCs to pass (coming from the west) or 
head straight there (coming from the south or east). 
Room B70 is approximately 50 ft. away, and it takes 
one turn for them to make it there, and 3d6 seconds 
for the goblins inside to get their gear together.
These goblins have been trained by the hobgob-
lins. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up 
into ranks, four goblins abreast. They advance on 
the PCs stabbing the closest with their spears. The 
goblins hold their bucklers facing forward, offering 
more protection (+1 AC) to the goblin on their left. 
The goblins allow the PCs to rush them, fighting 
better close in.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give the goblins total cover for the first 3 rounds of 
combat. To decrease the challenge, reinforcements 
arrive in double the time.
TACTICS OF THE 
HOLY GOBLIN EMPIRE
Under the guidance of the hobgoblins, 
the goblin forces loyal to Argliss the 
Goblin King are quite formidable. They 
wield short spears & wooden bucklers, 
attacking foes in well-coordinated 
phalanx maneuvers. They advance on 
their enemies with the cold precision 
that has been drilled into them by their 
hobgoblin taskmasters.
The hobgoblins, for their part, have 
formed an effective cavalry unit. 
Mounted on trained worgs, they dart 
in and out of their foes, flanking them 
with rapid attacks. The bugbears and 
rebel goblins have not had success 
against these new tactics. The lightning 
attacks of the hobgoblins, coupled with 
the relentless ones of the foot soldiers 
have proved an effective combination.

165
B70 . FORWARD OUTPOST
If the goblins did not assist the patrol in Room B96, 
read the following.
This long room is an outpost for goblin patrols, 
who are going through the grind of cleaning 
weapons, and so on.
If the goblins did assist the patrol in Room B69, 
read the following.
This long room is an outpost for the goblins. The 
goblin reinforcements spilled out of this room, 
leaving nothing behind. A few hides are laid out 
in precise rows for sleeping. Now empty weapon 
racks rest against the western wall of the room. 
These aren’t typical chaotic goblins. They are 
well-disciplined.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: If the ten elite goblins in this room did 
not assist the goblin patrol in Room B69, they are 
present. They gather their equipment (requiring a 
turn of not moving) and attack the PCs. If the gob-
lins did assist the patrol, then this room is empty.
Encounter Condition: Cover (soft)
Tactics: These goblins have been trained by hobgob-
lins. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form ranks, 
four goblins abreast, two rows deep. The smallest 
two escape through the north door, to get rein-
forcements from Rooms B71, B72, and B73. Alterna-
tively, they throw javelins from the rear ranks.
They advance stabbing the closest PCs with their 
spears. They hold their bucklers facing forward, of-
fering more protection (increasing the AC by +1) to 
the goblin on their left. They allow the PCs to rush 
them, fighting most effectively in close proximity.
This is not an easy encounter and should be an 
indication of this Section’s difficulty. These gob-
lins are not pushovers and challenging them may 
be harder than the PCs thought (which is why the 
bugbears have trouble fighting them).
Treasure: 1d20 javelins and 1d6 spears survive the 
battle. If the PCs did not fight the goblins here, 
double the number of weapons found. There are 
also four suits of leather armor (goblin-sized).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have Haglar Quickwhip (Room B71) arrive 4d6 sec-
onds later (without the goblins retrieving him). To 
decrease the challenge, remove four goblins.
B71 . HAGLAR QUICKWHIP
The door opens slowly. The air reeks of unpleasant 
odors, but the room itself is laid out neatly. A 
simple cot is placed against the southern wall, 
while a desk with various maps and notes sits near 
the western wall.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Haglar Quickwhip is the taskmaster for 
the forward outpost. He also is in charge of the 
small jail in Rooms B72 and B73. He is a formidable 
opponent and a tireless leader. He trains the gob-
lins constantly. He drives the strong to be strong 
and the weak to grow up or move on. He has no 
patience for those who cannot keep up. Even while 
the patrols sleep, Haglar trains, does push-ups, and 
generally stays alert. He’s the quintessential elite 
single-minded warrior.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Concealment, Echoes 
2, Fearless
Tactics: If Haglar hears the PCs coming, he prepares 
for an ambush, attacking from the shadows. Haglar 
stays out of reach of melee combat, deftly using his 
whip to both attack and drive back the PCs. He ma-
neuvers around the room as best as he can, despite 
the limited space. Since he is not above hurting 
those weaker than him, a spellcaster foolish enough 
to expose himself is an easy target.
If forced into melee combat, he disarms the 
nearest PC and uses their weapon or a scimitar 
from his back scabbard (which he wields with two 
hands). Haglar does not call for help until he’s 
reduced to half hit points or less, at which point the 
patrols in Rooms B69 and B70 are allowed Wisdom 
(Perception) checks to see if they hear him. Due to 
the nature of the walls in this room, the goblins 
suffer disadvantage to their checks.
Treasure: On the desk are notes and maps referring 
to various enemy patrols in this Section. The notes 
are written in a scrawling hand, and succeeding a 
DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary 
to make any sense of them.
If deciphered, the notes mention an increase in 
bugbear raids, as well as an ill-fated raid by rebel 
goblins. The last patrol captured a rebel, who is now 
locked in Room B73. The goblin king has ordered 
that the rebel be sacrificed to their god in two days.

166
In addition to his personal possessions, Haglar 
carries a sturdy ring of three keys. One key leads 
to the locked door at Room B72. Another leads to 
Room B73. Finally, the third leads to the worg sta-
bles in Rooms B77 through B82.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the number of goblins affected by Com-
mander of the King’s Horde from 1d3 to 1d6. To 
decrease the challenge, lower it to one.
B72 . THE GOBLIN JAIL
The door to this room is locked. A DC 17 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check picks the door successfully. 
However, there is a 15% chance that the door is also 
barred, requiring a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check 
to break open (DC 22 when locked).
Strong chains and manacles hang from the walls 
and a cell is set in the northern wall. Faint, fearful 
moaning issues forth from the cell.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room serves as the detention area 
for anything captured by the goblin patrols in this 
Section of the dungeon. This jail is overseen by 
Haglar Quickwhip (room B71). If the PCs make too 
much noise in this room, allow Haglar a (DC 18) 
Wisdom (Perception) check to notice, and arrive 4d4 
seconds later.
Encounter Condition: Drafty
Tactics: The jail is empty. The door to the north is 
sturdier than most but has a patchwork lock cut 
into the wood. It looks jury-rigged by crude hands 
as if a saw and hammer were the only avail-
able tools.
The small cell (Room B73) houses a lone goblin

B73 . CAPTURED REBEL
The door to this cell is locked, requiring a DC 17 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (or the key from 
Haglar’s belt) to unlock.
Huddled far in the corner is a frightened goblin. 
He is startled by your presence and yelps when he 
notices you.
Initial Attitude: Friendly
Encounter: This wounded goblin, named G’lp, was 
part of a failed raiding party on the part of the rebel 
goblin factions. Once he has been assured that the 
patrols, especially Haglar, have been dealt with, he 
blubbers incoherently, attempting to explain the 
current situation and how the usurper who sits on 
the goblin throne has wronged his people.
If the PCs don’t know what or who Haglar is, he 
assumes the hobgoblin is still alive and cries out for 
help (in goblin), in the hopes of currying favor with 
his jailer. Haglar arrives 1d3 rounds later.
The PCs make out that there is a deep schism 
between the goblins, and the majority of them 
worship a newfound god. The current goblin 
king, who is also the leader of their new religion, 
has formed an alliance with the hobgoblins and 
is training an army to conquer the entire Region 
in the name of his deity. Any goblins that do not 
follow his commands are considered traitors and 
hunted mercilessly. The lucky ones die in combat. 
The unfortunate ones are captured and sacrificed in 
the name of this new god.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: If the PCs release him, G’lp flees the area 
entirely, making his way back to the rebel encamp-
ments on the far side of the Region. If the PCs do 
not release G’lp, he curses the PCs vehemently, 
invoking the names of every stone spirit he can 
muster. If the PCs welcome him into their party, he 
joins, trying to lead the PCs to the rebels. Oth-
erwise, he is glad to be a “part of the team” and 
does his best to carry his weight. Whenever the 
PCs enter a room with G’lp, there is a 35% chance 
that he’s been here before and knows how to “by-
pass” the room.

B74. ANTECHAMBER OF THE GOBLIN KING
If the PCs killed Hammerfist in Room B85, he is not 
present here.
This large, rectangular room (almost a hallway) is 
polished brightly. Eighteen fierce-looking goblins, 
each wielding a spear, stare at you coldly. Behind 
them, a tall, wide-shouldered hobgoblin carries a 
fist-shaped mallet.
If the goblins heard the PCs coming, read this:
With quick precision, they form a tight phalanx 
and move with deadly intent. The hobgoblin rushes 
madly, swinging his mallet with abandon.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: As the PCs enter the antechamber, they 
are attacked by eighteen goblin warriors and the 
captain of the king’s elite guard, a huge hobgoblin 
named Hammerfist. Because the goblins are train-
ing with Hammerfist, their adrenaline is up and the 
impending fight is just an excuse to cut loose.
After three rounds of combat, Argliss enters 
from Room B75, flanked by two hobgoblin guards. 
If the fight isn’t going too poorly for his men, he or-
ders his guardsmen to stand down and invites the 
PCs into his throne room. The goblin king is articu-
late and polite, unusual for a goblin of any stature.
THE GOBLIN KING
Some time ago the doppelganger Argliss 
entered the Region. He was amused by the 
goblinoids trapped here. Out of boredom, 
he assumed the guise of a goblin and slowly 
worked his way into the good graces of the 
reigning goblin king, Sug’kt. Soon he became a 
chief advisor. He relished the role of bringing a 
culture out of the shadows to suit his whims.
When word of the new “deity” arrived, Argliss 
saw a chance to improve his position amongst 
the goblins. He recently discovered the goblin 
king kept a powerful artifact hidden in his pos-
session. Wanting it for himself, Argliss knew he 
would have to be the goblin king’s confidante. 
Hoping to ingratiate himself with the goblins, 
he urged the king to embrace this new deity. 
The goblin king was incensed. Sug’kt felt he 
alone was ruler of the goblins, as decreed by 
the ancient stone spirits his ancestors wor-
shiped. Popular support was behind the new 
deity, however, and Argliss seized his chance to 
advance his position by staging a coup.
He declared Sug’kt a heretic, sacrificed the 
former king, and claimed the throne in the 
name of the new god of the goblins, Noren-
dithas Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter 
of Foes. Argliss began his quest to not only 
uncover the hidden artifact, but to establish his 
rule over the entire Region.
Unable to locate the artifact, he enlisted the 
help of a halfling who had entered the Section 
(see The Halfling). Argliss believes that Bartleby 
will return the artifact to him, in exchange for 
the goblin’s protection and any trinkets he may 
find. While he awaits Bartleby’s success, he has 
made strides toward ruling the dungeon.
Argliss approached the beleaguered hobgob-
lins, offering them a prime place in his empire. 
Wishing to seek revenge upon the bugbears 
that had tormented them for so long, the hob-
goblins accepted his offer. They now serve as 
elite guards and trainers of the goblin army.
Upon encountering the PCs, Argliss tries to 
ally with them. He feels their power and knows 
they could be very disruptive to his efforts. He 
is willing to assist the PCs in their mission, as 
long as they return the favor and help him wipe 
out the bugbears and rebel faction of goblins.
If the PCs do not accept his offer, all goblins 
loyal to him attack the PCs on sight.
TACTICS
Argliss is not a fighter. In the event of conflict, 
he orders his guards to attack while he runs off. 
Once the battle is engaged he changes shape 
to something inconspicuous and flees the area, 
returning to his throne room.
If Argliss is cornered and cannot escape, he 
uses the rod of wonder and necklace of fireballs 
liberally until he causes enough of a distraction 
that he can flee.

168
If more than five goblins have been slain, how-
ever, he directs the hobgoblins to join him as he 
bars the door and prepares for the PCs. In this case, 
the PCs are in for a tough fight. Additionally, if 
the PCs do not wish to speak with the goblin king, 
the battle continues until either the guards or the 
PCs are dead.
Encounter Condition: Fearless (save for the 
goblin king).
Tactics: These elite goblins are just now starting their 
training with Hammerfist. The others are either 
on patrol or standing guard in another area of 
the dungeon.
In combat, instead of swarming the PCs, they 
form up into ranks, six goblins abreast, three rows 
deep. They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest 
PCs with their spears. They hold their bucklers fac-
ing forward, offering more protection (+1 bonus to 
AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the 
PCs to rush them, gaining attacks of opportunity as 
the PCs move into their threat range.
Hammerfist on the other hand, hunts the PCs. 
He does not draw attacks of opportunity if he can 
help it, but he does try to push past anyone who 
leaves an opening. Hammerfist, hates clerics and 
targets those openly displaying holy symbols. He is 
also fond of crippling attacks and targets PCs with 
little to no armor when he can.
Treasure: The weapon racks are filled with spears. All 
the spears are small, however, designed for goblins. 
Their size means for creatures larger than small size 
they lose reach and gain thrown (40/80).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase each goblin’s hit points by +5. To reduce 
the challenge of this encounter remove six goblins.
B75. THRONE ROOM OF THE GOBLIN KING
If the PCs accepted the goblin king’s offer to negoti-
ate, read the following.
This room is large and opulently decorated. Hides 
from various animals are layered on the floor, while 
others hang as trophies or tapestries from the walls. 
Two large braziers cast a sinister, yet regal glow on 
a throne of bone and stone standing prominently in 
the room, and it is where the goblin king sits.
He wears a bright leather vest and pants. A velvet 
cloak hangs from his shoulders. On his head 
rests a light, silver crown, and he wields a multi-
hued scepter in his left hand. “Welcome friends, 
I am Argliss, King of the Goblins and Voice of 
Norendithas Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter 
of Foes. The Stoneshaper has brought us together 
for great things I’m sure. Please, hear what I have to 
say,” the goblin king intones as you approach him.
If the PCs declined the goblin king’s offer to parlay, 
or have snuck in, read the following.
The room is large, and well-appointed for goblins 
but without the pomp and circumstance of the 
goblin king, his court, and his guards, it looks like 
any room that’s been covered in hides. A pair of large 
braziers cast a ruddy glow about the room, playing 
off the brightly polished walls. In the center is a 
throne of rubble and bones, a scepter resting upon it.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: If the PCs choose to continue the bat-
tle in Room B74, this encounter does not happen 
and they are free to explore the room as long as 
they wish.
The goblin king, Argliss, who is interested in the 
PCs’ services, informs them of the new destiny of 
the goblins. Their god, Norendithas Stoneshaper 
the Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes, has finally ar-
rived and promises to lead them to power and glory.
“Any who serve the will of the Stoneshaper shall be 
greatly rewarded, in this life and the next!” the goblin 
king proclaims.
The goblin king only wishes for more patsies 
to serve his whims. Argliss is very good at hiding 
this truth though; only a successful DC 24 Wisdom 
(Insight) check lets the PCs know the goblin king is 
being less than truthful.
If the PCs agree to assist the goblin king, he 
tasks them with killing the rebel chieftain Guk 
(Room B95). They must return with proof of his 
death. If they do so, the goblin king welcomes 
them as members of the glorious empire of the 
Stoneshaper.
Once the PCs agree to ally with the goblin king, 
the elite hobgoblin guard files out of the room and 
returns to their barracks (Room B84). Hammerfist 
snarls at the PCs one last time before he too leaves 
and returns to his quarters (Room B85).

169
If the PCs refuse the goblin king’s offer, he be-
comes enraged. “None defy the will of the Stone-
shaper!” he shouts. Hammerfist lets loose with a 
bellowing war cry and is ready to charge the PCs. 
The goblin king halts his advance however and of-
fers the PCs one last chance to see the error of their 
ways and join him.
A second refusal is all it takes. “May the Stone-
shaper have mercy on your wretched souls,” the 
goblin king says as Hammerfist and the elite guard 
attack the PCs.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The goblin warriors move on Hammerfist’s 
command. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form 
up into ranks, six goblins abreast, three rows deep. 
They advance on the PCs, stabbing the closest to 
them with their spears. They hold their bucklers fac-
ing forward, offering more protection (+1 bonus to 
AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the 
PCs to rush them, gaining attacks of opportunity as 
the PCs move into their threat range.
Hammerfist goes after the weakest PC first, 
targeting spellcasters first. He also has a fond 
hatred for clerics and abuses them at every turn. 
He fights as intelligently as possible, stepping back 
when overwhelmed and taking full advantage of 
prone PCs.
If the goblin king is in danger, he flees to Room 
B74, and from there heads to Room B77. In the 
meantime, he uses his rod of wonder on whatever 
PC presents the biggest threat and his necklace of 
fireballs if too many goblins fall.
Treasure: If the PCs choose not to listen to the goblin 
king, and he is forced to flee, he leaves behind his 
royal scepter (laying on his throne) on a failed DC 16 
Intelligence save. The scepter is a rod of wonder.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add three fighter levels to Hammerfist. To reduce 
the challenge of this encounter, remove one fighter 
level from Hammerfist.
B76. PRIVATE ROOM OF THE GOBLIN KING
The door leading to Region A is locked and barred, 
requiring a DC 30 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, 
followed by a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check to 
open. A small chest rests against the door as well, 
making it difficult to open the door all the way.
The doors from Room B75 are also locked and 
require a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to 
open. In both cases, the goblin king carries keys to 
these doors.
After you dispatch the last of the goblins, you 
enter this room, the private quarters of the goblin 
king, Argliss. The room is very befitting of a king. 
Exquisite hides are piled as a comfortable bed, 
while others adorn the walls as tapestries. A good-
sized strongbox is tucked into the northeastern 
corner of the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: If the PCs made an alliance with the gob-
lin king and attempt to enter this room, they are 
warned that it is off-limits. If they persist the goblin 
king calls off the alliance and orders his guards to 
attack the PCs. The goblin king flees before the PCs 
can capture or kill him, returning in 2d6 minutes 
with reinforcements to drive the PCs out.
This room is luxuriously furnished with a thick 
layer of hides forming a comfortable sleeping area 
in the northwestern corner. The walls are decorated 
with tapestries made of similar hides. They depict 
the conquests and glories of the new goblin king 
and his god.
A small chest is situated against the northeast-
ern wall. A DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check 
is required to unlock it. It contains the room’s trea-
sure (see below).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: +1 shortsword, +1 leather armor (made for a 
goblin), +1 buckler. It is possible the PCs may wish 
to take the hides as well for their own personal use, 
or for future sales. They are large, made of worg 
hide, and carrying more than one proves to be 
cumbersome.
Scaling: N/A

170
B77. ENTRANCE TO THE WORG STABLES
The door to this room (leading from the eastern hall) 
is locked, requiring a successful DC 19 Dexterrity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. The door leading 
from Region A is also locked, requiring a DC 22 Dex-
terity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.
Pungent smells and keening wails saturate the air. 
The floor is covered, stained, and scratched. Even 
the walls are not devoid of claw marks. Along the 
southern wall are a series of iron doors, much like 
cell doors. The room quiets for a brief moment, 
then it erupts into loud howls and barks. Whatever 
is in these cells, knows you’re here.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These cells are the goblins’ worg sta-
bles, the home of their vicious worg mounts. This 
hallway leads to the “cells’’ where the elite worg 
mounts are kept. The stables themselves are large. 
Most are noisy, except the one at the west end, 
which is deathly quiet. Due to their Scent ability, 
it is nearly impossible for the PCs to surprise the 
worgs in these cells.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Echoes 2, 
Unhallowed
Tactics: This series of cell doors are sturdy and are all 
locked. The keys to these doors are kept by Haglar 
(B71), the Goblin King’s (B75) bodyguards, and a 
handful of elite goblins.
The “cells” were used (long ago) to house 
demons, an effect that has caused the worgs to 
become even more bestial than they already were.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
B78 . WORG STABLE
Four large wolves sleep comfortably in this cell. 
Despite the barking and howling coming from 
other cells, these animals are not as crazed. One 
of the wolves looks up as you enter the room but 
quickly lies back down again.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: These four worgs have just returned from 
a successful patrol and are tired. Although the PCs 
represent a threat, they are satiated from hunting 
and want to rest. The worgs have enough energy to 
defend themselves if the PCs attack them but suffer 
from a level of exhaustion.
Encounter Condition: Fearless, Unhallowed
Tactics: These worgs fight like a typical pack, tripping 
and grounding the weakest PC and then mauling 
them while prone. If a single PC gets separated 
from the party, or the PC attacks too quickly, the 
worgs surround and flank them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this en-
counter, change the worgs’ initiative roll to 
exactly 1 lower than the highest PC, allowing 
them to ambush the “impulsive PC.” Alternately, 
add two worgs. To decrease the challenge, re-
move one worg.

171
B79 . THE BLACK WORG
The barks issuing from this cell are louder than 
from any other cell. With a successful DC 17 Wisdom 
(Perception) check, the PCs can discern a single loud 
bark, deeper and more aggressive than any of the 
other cells.
From the darkness, a large black wolf stands at 
least five feet at the shoulder. Its powerful muscles 
ripple under its sleek, black coat. At first, it doesn’t 
notice you. Suddenly its hackles raise, and it turns, 
snarling. With a mighty howl, it bursts free of its 
meager enclosure and leaps at you.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A black worg (worg alpha) is stabled here. 
It is twice as large as any other worg in the gob-
lin’s possession. It is also twice as feral. Worgs may 
have some measure of intelligence, but this one is 
bestial. When the PCs enter the room it breaks free 
of its inadequate holding pen and lunges at the 
nearest one. The PCs have no choice but to defend 
themselves.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Distracting Noises, 
Echoes 2, Fearless, Unhallowed
Tactics: The black worg attacks like an animal, vicious 
and unrelenting. It uses its trip attack every round, 
taking advantage of weak PCs. It knows no fear and 
does not respond to pain.
Killing the black worg earns the ire of Hammer-
fist (Room B85) should he find out; he was break-
ing in the worg to be his personal mount. There 
is little choice for the PCs in this matter, however, 
and they must deal with Hammerfist’s wrath. Any 
explanation the PCs offer is not good enough for 
the hobgoblin.
Treasure: The black worg wears a heavy leather collar, 
set with three discolored gems, none of which 
match. The collar is worth 25 gp to a jeweler who 
can salvage the stones.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two Hit Dice to the black worg. To reduce the 
challenge of this encounter, replace the black worg’s 
stats with that of a worg.
B80 . FILTHY STABLE
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.
A pack of four, miserable-looking wolves, larger 
than normal, are penned up in this stable. Whether 
they are being punished or neglected is difficult to 
say. They growl and snap at you, but otherwise 
remain behind their enclosure.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Four worgs are being punished for dis-
obeying their riders’ instructions during a recent 
patrol. They do not attack the PCs first but defend 
themselves if provoked. While not chained, they 
lack the ability to open the locked door.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If a fight ensues, the worgs gang up on 
the weakest PC first followed by other opponents 
without visible metal armor. They concentrate all 
their attacks until the victim is down. Like all pack 
animals, the alpha male delivers the coup de grace 
before the pack moves on to the next PC. If the 
victim fails a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw their 
attacks knock creatures they damage prone.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add one worg. To 
decrease the challenge, remove one worg.
B81 . EMPTY STABLE
No noise comes from this cell.
Like the other holding pens, this stable is shoddily 
constructed. This stable is empty, save for some 
discarded refuse on the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This stable is currently empty; the worgs 
normally housed in it are out on patrol with their 
hobgoblin masters. There is nothing of interest.
Encounter Condition: Fear 15, Unhallowed
Tactics: The goblins rely heavily on the training and 
cooperation of their worg mounts. It is quite obvi-
ous that the worgs stay here because they wish to, 
not because they are forced to.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A

172
B82. THE GOBLIN KING'S MOUNT, THE YETH HOUND
A sleek hound with a dull, black coat and glowing 
cherry-red eyes pads around in the most luxurious 
pen in the stables. This is the mount of the goblin 
king, and the king takes very good care of it. With 
a lazy turn of its head, the yeth hound takes you 
in—and promptly dismisses you.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: The yeth hound is the pride of the goblin 
king. Serving as his personal mount, it is not only 
effective in combat, but the goblin king considers 
the hound a symbol of his power and divine rule. 
For its part, the yeth hound could care less about 
the PCs. It is confident in its combat abilities and 
knows its master’s loyal servants are nearby.
The yeth hound only attacks if provoked.
Encounter Condition: Fear 14, Fearless, Unhallowed
Tactics: If the PCs attack the yeth hound, it flees and 
seeks out the goblin king (Room B75), unleashing 
a series of Bay attacks if cornered. If the PCs are 
stunned, the yeth hound slips by, continuing to Bay 
until it has escaped or is killed by the PCs.
Regardless of the outcome, the goblin king 
undoubtedly surmises the PCs killed his mount 
(unless he has yet to meet them, in which case he 
assumes it was bugbear raiders). Any alliance they 
forged is now broken. From this point on, all initial 
attitudes in encounters with the goblin king’s sol-
diers are considered Hostile.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have eight goblins arrive after 6d3 seconds to assist 
the yeth hound. To decrease the challenge, reduce 
the yeth hound’s hit points by -20.
B83. SOUTHWESTERN OUTPOST
If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in Room 
B75, read the following.
This squat, spartan room serves as the 
southwestern most outpost of the goblin empire. 
The dozen goblins in this room stare blankly at you 
as you enter. The goblin king has ordered his army 
to treat you with respect, but these goblins seem 
to be waiting for you to make a misstep; it is quite 
obvious they do not want you here.
If the PCs have not allied with the goblin king in 
Room B75, read the following.
This squat room is an outpost, guarding against 
incursions. Nearly a dozen goblins are messing 
about and get into formation as you enter.
If the goblins are not surprised, read the following.
They await you with their sharp spears pointing 
menacingly in your direction. They form a perfect 
phalanx and advance upon you.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly or Hostile
Encounter: There are twelve goblin warriors stand-
ing guard here in various stages of readiness. If 
surprised, they take a round to form up into ranks. 
If they heard the PCs coming, they are already in 
formation when the door opens, whether the PCs 
are allies or not.
If the PCs formed an alliance with the goblin 
king, the initial attitude of the goblins is Unfriendly. 
They allow the PCs to wander through the barracks 
as long as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs 
take any actions the goblins perceive as a threat, 
their attitude becomes Hostile and they attack.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: In combat, instead of swarming the PCs, they 
form up into ranks, four goblins abreast, three rows 
deep. They advance on the PCS stabbing the closest 
PCs with their spears. They hold their bucklers 
facing forward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to 
the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to 
rush them.
Two of the goblins are not Fearless and bail at 
the first sign of trouble (e.g., three goblins fall, they 
suffer at least 1 point of damage, overtly powerful 
magic is displayed, etc.). They head for Room B84 
to retrieve reinforcements, taking 4d6 seconds to 
get there and 4d6 seconds to return.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add six goblins. To reduce the challenge of this 
encounter, remove six.

173
B84. KING'S ELITE GUARD BARRACKS
If the PCs have formed an alliance with the goblin 
king in Room B75, read the following.
These barracks are simple and minimalist. These 
goblins have no requirement for comfort; they are 
hardened soldiers ready to die for their king and 
their god. They stare at you but do not make any 
aggressive moves. The king has granted you his 
protection, and they will not violate his orders.
If the PCs have not formed an alliance with the 
goblin king in Room B75, read the following.
These barracks are simple and minimalist.
If the goblins are not surprised, read the following.
You are confronted by twelve zealous and well-
trained goblins. They form one cohesive unit 
and raise their spears above their heads with a 
massive war cry.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent or Hostile
Encounter: There are twelve elite goblins standing 
guard here in various stages of readiness. If sur-
prised, they take a round to form up into ranks. If 
they heard the PCs coming, they are already in for-
mation when the door opens, whether the PCs are 
allies or not. They gain a +2 to their initiative rolls if 
the PCs make noise before entering.
If the PCs formed an alliance with the goblin 
king, the initial attitude of the goblins is Indifferent. 
They allow the PCs to wander through the barracks 
as long as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs 
take any actions the goblins perceive as a threat, 
their attitude becomes Hostile and they attack.
The room itself is a spartan affair with a weap-
on rack along the western wall and a precise layer 
of sleeping hides on the floor. If the PCs defeated 
the elite guard in Room B74, this room does not 
contain any goblins.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: As soon as the goblins spot the PCs, they take 
up defensive positions in the nearby halls, while the 
smallest two run to Room B86 for reinforcements.
These goblins have been trained by the hobgob-
lins. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up 
into three ranks, four goblins abreast. They advance 
on the PCs stabbing the closest with their spears. 
The goblins hold their bucklers facing forward, 
offering more protection (+1 to AC) to the goblin on 
their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them, 
as they fight more efficiently at close range.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each goblin +5 hp. To reduce the challenge, 
remove four goblins.
B85. HAMMERFIST, CAPTAIN OF THE KING'S GUARD
If the PCs have formed an alliance with the goblin 
king in Room B75, read the following.
The large hobgoblin from the king’s antechamber 
angrily paces back and forth in this room. He 
wields the same fist-shaped club, swinging wildly 
at the room’s walls. As he notices you, he violently 
spits at the ground. “Come to try and finish what I 
started, have you?” he taunts.
If the PCs have not formed an alliance with the 
goblin king in Room B75, read the following.
A large hobgoblin angrily paces back and forth in 
this room, he wields a fist-shaped club, swinging 
wildly at the room’s walls  A feral grin sprouts 
across his scarred face and he turns to face you 
“Finally!” he shouts.
After the PCs have cleared the room of any hostile 
creatures, or if they defeated Hammerfist in Room 
B74, read the following.
Hammerfist’s room is very spartan. A simple 
sleeping hide lies in a corner of the room. A map 
of the goblin empire is nailed to the southern 
wall. The western wall features a small collection 
of skulls, obviously war trophies the hobgoblin 
claimed from his foes.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Regardless of the PCs and their relation-
ship with the goblin king, Hammerfist’s attitude 
towards them is never better than Unfriendly. If 
the PCs killed the black worg in Room B79 (and he 
knows about it), Hammerfist becomes Hostile and 
attacks them, screaming about revenge.

174
As long as Hammerfist is merely Unfriendly 
towards the PCs, he doesn’t initiate combat against 
them. He does, however, taunt, threaten, and other-
wise provoke them into attacking him. Hammerfist 
does not like the PCs and wishes to see them dead.
Encounter Condition: Fearless, Negative Energy, 
Unhallowed
Tactics: Hammerfist thinks no one is stronger than 
he is. To prove it, he calls the strongest PC out to 
fight one-on-one. He goes toe to toe, never giving 
an inch. Because of his ego, he fights to the death.
If the PCs do not fight fair, neither does he. He 
finishes off unconscious PCs and helpless PCs have 
their fingers and hands broken under his boot or 
with his war club.
While fighting, he shouts obscenities and 
other unsavory things at the PCs but does not 
call for reinforcements. His aggressive and bois-
terous mannerism is sure to unnerve even the 
strongest PCs.
If reinforcements do arrive, it is of their own 
initiative. Hammerfist is immune to the Negative 
Energy in this room.
Treasure: Hammerfist keeps a strongbox. It is un-
locked as no one is foolish enough to tamper with 
his belongings. Inside the box is a sling, a handaxe, 
450 gp, 51 pp, a silver and gold ring with detailed 
filigree, an inlaid design of an owl (600 gp), six 
arrows, four bolts, and two healing potions.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the elite goblins in Room B84 arrive 3d6 
seconds later. To decrease the challenge, increase 
Haymaker’s movement penalty to -30 ft., and 
remove the hit die based damage from Maim.
B86. DRILL ROOM
If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in Room 
B75, read the following.
A huge hobgoblin barks commands and mercilessly 
drills a group of goblins. He glances over at you 
but says nothing. You get the distinct impression 
that treaty or no, this hobgoblin is looking for any 
excuse to test his men against your mettle.
If the PCs have not allied with the goblin king in 
Room B75, read the following.
A mighty bellow erupts as you enter this room. ‘At 
last! Fresh meat!” roars a huge hobgoblin wielding 
a wicked great axe. Upon his command, the goblins 
in the room form up and advance on you with 
calculating precision. The hobgoblin, however, 
charges at you with wild abandon.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: There are twelve goblin warriors in various 
stages of training in this room. If surprised, they 
take a round to form into ranks. If they heard the 
PCs coming, they are already in formation when the 
door opens, whether the PCs are allies or not.
If the PCs formed an alliance with the goblin 
king, the initial attitude of the goblins is Indifferent. 
They allow them to wander through the barracks 
as long as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs 
take any actions the goblins perceive as a threat, 
their attitude becomes Hostile and they attack.
Their leader, Goblinbane, is a wicked taskmas-
ter and the chief trainer under the goblin king. 
He earned his name for his brutal methods and 
callous disregard for whoever could not withstand 
the training. As long as the PCs do not disrupt his 
training, he is content to let them watch and learn 
how a true master creates an army.
Of course, if the PCs have not allied with the 
goblin king, Goblinbane and his goblin trainees at-
tack the PCs as soon as they step foot in the room.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: These goblins have been trained by Goblin-
bane. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up 
into ranks, four goblins abreast, three rows deep. 
They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest with 
their spears. They hold their bucklers facing for-
ward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to the goblin 
on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them 
forming a defensive line of spears.
Goblinbane seeks out the most prominent PC 
and engages them in close combat, swinging his 
powerful greataxe mercilessly. Occasionally Gob-
linbane barks commands to the goblins, adjusting 
their tactics to keep up with the PCs’ movements.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase challenge, goblin warriors from 
Room B83 arrive in 6d6 seconds. To lessen it, re-
move Goblinbane’s Martial Advantage and lower the 
number affected by the Commander of the King’s 
Horde to one.

B87 . PATROL BARRACKS
If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in Room 
B75, read the following.
This barracks is a long room with simple weapon 
racks and hides on the floor. You are met with some 
cold stares and toothy grimaces but are otherwise 
left alone by the goblins.
If the PCs have not formed an alliance with the 
goblin king in Room B75, read the following.
A patrol, recently returned, stops in their tracks as 
you enter the room. With uncanny precision, they 
return to formation and set their sights on you.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room is a holding area. Returning 
patrols rest here before going back out. There is a 
staging area towards the east where the patrols de-
part from. There are twelve goblin warriors stowing 
gear and relaxing. If surprised, they take a round to 
form up into ranks. If they heard the PCs coming, 
they are already in formation when the door opens, 
whether the PCs are allies or not.
If the PCs are allies of the goblin king, the initial 
attitude of the goblins is Indifferent. They allow the 
PCs to wander through the barracks as long as they 
do not disturb anything. If the PCs take any actions 
the goblins perceive as a threat, their attitude be-
comes Hostile and they attack the PCs.
The barracks itself resembles others in the gob-
lin empire. The weapons racks and sleeping hides 
are precisely arranged and the crude map in the 
middle of the room accurately details the goblin 
patrols in this area of the dungeon.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: If the PCs engage the goblins they have to 
deal with reinforcements. After 6d6 seconds, an-
other phalanx of twelve goblin warriors arrive from 
Room B88. Their tactics are identical to the goblins 
already engaged with the PCs, but they attempt to 
flank the PCs currently engaged.
These goblins have been trained by Goblinbane 
(Room B86). Instead of swarming the PCs, they 
form up into three ranks, four goblins abreast. 
They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest with 
their spears. The goblins hold their bucklers facing 
forward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to the 
goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to 
rush them, fighting better close in.
Treasure: The footlockers are filled with personal 
(worthless) trinkets, only valuable to the goblins.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the goblin warriors from Room B88 join the 
battle one turn after rolling initiative. To decrease 
the challenge, the goblins from Room B88 arrive 
after 36 seconds.
B88 . SOUTHEASTERN OUTPOST
If the PCs have allied with the goblin king in room 
B75, read the following.
This outpost serves as a forward observation 
point and command center in the goblin king’s 
war against the rebel splinter faction. A dozen 
goblins prepare themselves for their next patrol as 
you enter. Your presence is ignored, as the goblins 
have more pressing concerns. Reports of a large 
upcoming raid are circulating amongst the troops, 
and each wants to be a member of the patrol that 
crushes the rebel scum.
If the PCs have not allied with the goblin king in 
Room B75, read the following.
As you enter this outpost, a dozen bloodthirsty 
goblins turn and face you. They quickly grab their 
weapons and form an impressive phalanx. Their 
spear points drop and they attack.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room is a transitional chamber. 
Returning patrols rest here before going back out. 
There is a staging area towards the east where the 
patrols depart from. There are twelve goblin war-
riors stowing gear and relaxing. If surprised, they 
take a round to form up into ranks. If they heard 
the PCs coming, they are already in formation when 
the door opens, whether the PCs are allies or not.
If the PCs have allied with the goblin king, the 
initial attitude of the goblins is Indifferent. They al-
low the PCs to wander through the barracks as long 
as they do not disturb anything. If the PCs take any 
actions the goblins perceive as a threat, their atti-
tude becomes Hostile and they attack the PCs.
The barracks itself is much like the others con-
tained in the goblin empire. The weapons racks and 

176
sleeping hides are arranged precisely and the crude 
map in the middle of the room accurately details 
the goblin patrols in this area of the dungeon.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: If the PCs engage the goblins they have to 
deal with reinforcements. After 6d6 seconds of 
combat, another phalanx of twelve goblin warriors 
arrive from Room B87. Their tactics are identical to 
the goblins already engaged with the PCs, but they 
attempt to flank the PCs currently engaged.
These goblins have been trained by Goblinbane 
(Room B86). Instead of swarming the PCs, they 
form up into three ranks, four goblins abreast. 
They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest with 
their spears. The goblins hold their bucklers facing 
forward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to the 
goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to 
rush them, fighting better close in.
Treasure: The footlockers are filled with personal 
(worthless) trinkets, only valuable to the goblins.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, have 
the goblins from Room B87 join the battle after 
36 seconds.
B89 . HAUNTED TOMBS
The hallways intersect, again and again. It would 
seem as though a door could appear somewhere. 
But there is none. Just the same clean corridor over 
and over again. And then the realization that the 
silence is heavy hits you. Something is amiss.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A sense of dread should overcome the 
PCs at this point. Feel free to spook them at ev-
ery turn with shadows and intermittent sounds of 
chains rattling. Have the command, suggestion, and 
cause fear spells be cast on them randomly. Lastly, a 
deep, allip-like moan is sure to scare them straight.
In addition to any other effects going on, there 
is a blanket of silence that pervades the tomb and 
affects the PCs 50% of the time, severely hamper-
ing their ability to communicate and cast spells. 
While there is no noise, treat this as Distracting 
Noises for the purposes of spellcasting.
hAUnTED ToMb ConTEnTs
For every tomb the PCs open, roll on this table:
D20encounter
1A hot wind escapes from the tomb. Drafty.
2
A swarm of rats run past the PCs and out the door. While they are no threat and deal no damage, if 
they run west or south they are sure to find the goblins who send scouts to investigate.
3A small earthquake rumbles through the section. Tremors 15.
4-12Nothing.
13
The tomb is worn by time and falling apart. If the PCs decide to enter despite this it begins to crumble 
and fall inward on them. Any PCs who fail a Dexterity (DC 15) saving throw receive 6d4 bludgeoning 
damage as the stone collapses onto them.
14A fire trap (Room B18) has been cast on the threshold to keep grave robbers at bay.
15
The door unseals and a deluge of water pours forth. PCs within 10 ft. have their torches doused and 
are soaked.
16
When the threshold is crossed, a spray of darts fly out of the tomb. Any creature not completely 
obscured by another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage 
and be poisoned until their next long rest. The trapped tiles can be found with a DC 16 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check, and disabled with a further DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand).
17
When the seal on the tomb breaks, centuries of death fumes (a 5th-level cloudkill, spell save DC 14) roll 
forth from the tomb.
18The PCs are attacked by 1d3+1 wights.
19The PCs are attacked by 1d4+1 vargouilles. Ambush.
20The PCs are attacked by 1d6+1 ghouls.

177
While the map does not show secret doors, 
there is a way to enter each tomb. The mecha-
nism is complicated and to date, the goblins have 
not found it.
Located at the two-foot-high mark on the north 
wall of each tomb is a small unholy sigil. While each 
is designed differently, the key to opening the tomb 
is through this sigil. There are three different ways 
to open the tomb. One is for a lawful good PC (or 
one you determine sufficiently demonstrates those 
values) to completely trace the entire surface of the 
sigil. Another is to cast knock directly onto the sigil. 
Finally, the PCs can smear the blood of an angel 
into the sigil, covering the surface.
If any of these actions are taken, a 5-ft-by-5-ft 
section of wall slides open and up into the ceiling. 
If the PCs open a tomb, roll on the table in the pre-
vious page to see if they encounter anything:
Encounter Condition: [Ambush], Cursed 3, [Distract-
ing Noises], Drafty, Fear 16, Haunted, Negative 
Energy, [Spell Resistance], Unhallowed
Tactics: Once the tomb is open, the creatures (if 
present) lunge at the PCs. These beasts have been 
entombed for centuries and are eager to escape, 
most likely fighting in a crazed and wild manner. 
The actual details are left up to the GM, but these 
creatures are interested in feeding on the flesh of 
one PC and escaping soon after. Killing them all is 
not possible.
The ghouls attack the lead PCs, the vargouilles 
use their Kiss attack, and the wights swipe at the 
PC with the least armor on. They do not put them-
selves in harm’s way to get to the PCs but do not let 
the PCs box them in either.
Treasure: None of these creatures were buried with 
treasure, but the GM is welcome to drop a trin-
ket here and there, so the PCs don’t feel cheated. 
The largest treasure should be no bigger than 
a +1 dagger or a healing potion.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
roll twice per tomb. To decrease the challenge, roll 
once for every 2 tombs opened.
B90 . ABANDONED BARRACKS
The hallway leading to this room is trapped. Allow 
the PCs Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice, but 
since there are four traps in various locations, the GM 
should feel free to use them as they see fit.
 '
Portcullis Trap. When 15 lbs. of weight are applied to 
the pressure plate on either side of the arch a port-
cullis slams down. Creatures underneath are skew-
ered and crushed and must succeed a Dexterity 
saving throw (DC 13) or take 2d8 piercing and 2d8 
bludgeoning damage. Additionally, creatures that 
fail to save are pinned underneath, preventing 
movement until freed. Any creature that can lift 
200 lbs. of weight can reliably lift the gate 1 ft. off 
the ground, with the weight requirement doubling 
for each additional foot of distance desired.
While not subtle, the trap still requires active at-
tention to notice. Once found the plate can simply 
be stepped over, or disabled by wedging it.
 '
Spring-loaded Darts. When the tripwire is pulled a 
spray of darts snap across the hall. Starting from 
the east wall any creature not completely obscured 
by another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving 
throw or take 2d8 piercing damage and be poisoned 
until their next long rest.
The trap holes and tripwire can be found with 
a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and 
disabled with a further DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight 
of Hand). Undoing this mechanism leaves the 
darts open for the taking. The first time a dart 
deals damage it loses its poison and poisons the 
damaged creature if they fail a DC 14 Constitution 
saving throw.
 '
Crude Spear Trap. Any PC rolling higher than 12 on 
a Wisdom (Perception) check in the hall easily spots 
the spears. These spears spring forward if the trig-
ger (a weave of wooden poles hidden under a hide 
on the floor, spanning the hall) is activated. Dis-
arming it is as simple as knocking each of the two 
spears over, where their springs engage and disarm 
themselves.
PCs that fail to notice the spears or charge in 
heedlessly and trigger the trap, must succeed a Dex-
terity save (DC 15) or receive 1d8 piercing damage.
 '
Tripping Chain. Strung across the path is a thin 
chain. Robust enough to be a tripping hazard, and 
acting as a setup for a much nastier chain. Both 
are simple and crudely concealed (DC 11 Wisdom 
(Perception) required to spot). Stepping on the first 
chain will knock the victim prone unless they pass a 
Dexterity or Strength saving throw (DC 12), wherein 
they must succeed a second Dexterity saving throw 
(DC 14) to take half damage from falling onto the 
spiked chain.

178
Creatures that step onto the spiked chain receive 
2d8 piercing damage as the wicked hooks and 
barbs rend at them. They may also trip from this, 
requiring the same saves as above but done with 
advantage this time. Reduce this damage by 1 for 
every point of AC the creature possesses over 12. 
Creatures that fall onto the chain receive an addi-
tional 1d8 damage for each size category they are 
above small (medium +1d8, large +2d8, huge +3d8).
Outside of adverse circumstances, small and tiny 
creatures are not tall enough to fall onto the spiked 
chain and simply faceplant into the floor.
Disarming the chains requires pulling the inter-
locking pins that keep them taut and tossing them 
aside. No check is needed once spotted. However, 
the mechanism isn’t completely intuitive. Less 
mechanically inclined PCs might require a suc-
cessful Intelligence (Investigation) (DC 10) check to 
understand.
A long wide room stretches before you. Abandoned, 
disheveled, and broken bunks and cots line the 
walls and floor. Someone or something has 
ransacked these chambers. The thick layer of dust 
suggests it was not recently cleaned.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Long ago, the goblins controlled most of 
the Region. Now, with the bugbear raiding parties 
and goblin rebels, it is difficult to control the outly-
ing sections. The hobgoblins convinced the goblin 
king it would be easier to defend a smaller area, and 
pulled back to Room B69 through B88 (hence the 
concentration of manpower in such a small area).
As a result, they often send patrols up here to 
“check things out,” but the recent “tossing” of the 
room has caused them to rethink their strategy. If 
a goblin Random Encounter is rolled in the vicinity 
of Rooms B90 and B91, there is a 50% chance the 
Encounter is “Nothing.”
Encounter Condition: Fearless, Hazardous Footing 14
Tactics: There is nothing here now, but if the PCs 
insist on rummaging through the debris, feel free 
to have a bugbear patrol happen upon them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a pit trap (Room B40). To reduce the challenge, 
remove the portcullis trap.
B91 . NORTHEASTERN OUTPOST
This box-like room smells of charcoal and smoke. 
The blackened walls and burned furniture indicate 
only one culprit—fire. Along the back wall, resting 
on a small ledge, is a red and black urn, apparently 
unscarred by all the chaos.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Another abandoned outpost, this room 
has been set ablaze and sacked several times, leav-
ing the goblins wondering what the bugbears’ true 
tactics are. On the far wall is a small ledge with a red 
and black urn. On its face is written “The Unnamed 
Law” in Goblinoid. The bugbears hope that the 
goblins will inspect it or at least assume an import-
ant bugbear was killed. So far no one has fallen for 
it, but should anyone touch the urn, a trap triggers 
and darts fly from the north and south walls.
 '
Spring-loaded darts. When the urn is touched darts 
spray across the room. Starting from the traps’ re-
spective walls any creature not completely obscured 
by another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving 
throw or take 2d8 piercing damage and be poisoned 
until their next long rest. This occurs twice, once for 
the north and once for the south.
The trap-holes and hair trigger beneath the urn 
can be found with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check, or a Wisdom (Perception) roll over 18 
in the room, and disabled with a DC 16 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand). Undoing this mechanism leaves 
the darts open for the taking. When used as weap-
ons, the first time a dart deals damage it loses its 
poison and poisons the target if they fail a DC 14 
Constitution saving throw.
Encounter Condition: Ambush
Tactics: This room is patrolled by the bugbears often. 
They hope the goblins will believe the room was an 
important outpost and its loss drove them deeper 
into the dungeon, or that an important bugbear 
was killed here. Either way, its presence baffles the 
goblins and sooner or later a patrol will get antsy 
and grab the urn. To add insult to injury, if the trap 
goes off, there is a 25% chance that bugbears from 
Room B66 arrive to investigate in 3d6 rounds.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add a loud 
alarm to the trap that guarantees bugbears from 
room B66 investigate. To reduce the challenge, 
lower the Wisdom (Perception) check to 14.

D20encounter
1
The path is trapped with spring-loaded Darts. When the tripwire is pulled a spray of darts snap across 
the hall. Pick d3 PCs, they must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage 
and be poisoned until their next long rest. The trap holes and tripwire can be found with a DC 16 
Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled with a further DC 16 Sleight of Hand. Undoing this 
mechanism leaves the darts open for the taking. The first time a dart deals damage it loses its poison 
and poisons the damaged creature if they fail a Constitution (DC 14) save.
2
A whittled wooden duckling lies off the path. Touching the duckling soaks the PC and casts lightning 
bolt (spell save DC 13) at 3rd level towards them. This happens only once, and dispel magic will remove 
the hostile enchantment without harming the item. Any creature who holds the duckling is rapidly 
soaked, conferring resistance to fire damage and vulnerability to lightning damage while held. 
Dropping the duck dries them off instantly.
3
A glyph of warding (3rd level, explosive, fire) is inscribed in the hallway. Circumventing this takes 
10 minutes.
4
An illusory beast stalks the hallway. The PC that witnesses it first is harried by the phantasmal 
killer spell once every hour, for the next 10 hours or until it is slain. The beast runs but if chased is 
ultimately cornered. It has the stats of a wolf but is resistant to nonmagical damage.
5
A fire trap (Room B18) is cast on a tile in the hallway. It can be spotted with a Wisdom (Perception) 
check roll of 14 or greater. PCs that can sense magic have advantage on this roll. Failure of any party 
member to spot the trap sets it off.
6-12Nothing.
13A dead blink dog lies in the hallway, covered in blood and stinger holes (stirges). Stagnant Air.
14The air is alive with 2d8+1 stirges. The stirges buzz loudly and dart back and forth across the hall.
15
A lone wight wanders the hall, seeking refuge from the infernal maze. As it spots the PCs it lets out a 
blood-curdling scream and attacks.
16
Vines cloak the walls, choking the torchlight and cutting vision in half. Lurking amongst the greenery 
are 2d6 assassin vines lying in wait for unsuspecting prey. Ambush.
17
1d4+1 vargouilles screech and whine as they corner a lone rebel goblin. The goblin is curled up in 
a ball, crying and shrieking, but the vargouilles are too loud. They are enjoying their torment of the 
goblin and suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the PCs.
18
A group of 2d6+3 goblins stumble across the PCs. These are rebel goblins making a foray into the 
goblin king’s territory and do not expect to find anyone in the maze. Confused, and unsure of the 
PCs, they do not attack. Their attitude is Friendly unless attacked.
19
One hobgoblin, mounted on a worg, and six goblin warriors hunt for rebel goblins. They are loyal and 
obedient to the goblin king but patrol the maze fearfully. If the PCs have an alliance with the goblin 
king their attitude is Indifferent (unless attacked). Otherwise, their attitude is Hostile.
20
Bartleby (Room B28) races through the maze. He knows the maze is not a safe place to be and he 
appears to be dancing around stone to stone, trying to avoid particular spots in the maze. If the 
PCs work out a deal with Bartleby, he guides them through the maze, cutting in half the number of 
random encounters the PCs must experience. Nonetheless, he does not know the way out and uses 
Survival to look for drafts and other tell-tale signs of an exit.

180
You enter a long, winding tunnel. The walls are 
covered in moss and vines and a pungent stench 
fills the air. Off in the distance, you can hear the 
sounds of various creatures, their echoes playing 
tricks along the snaking corridor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The maze is a unique feature in the Re-
gion. No groups claim it and most avoid it if possi-
ble. It is a very dangerous, ever-changing trap. The 
bugbears and hobgoblins are smart enough to avoid 
the dangers of the maze, while the goblins have 
developed a number of superstitions regarding it.
The goblin rebels use the maze to their advan-
tage. Situating themselves on the other end of the 
maze, they have a nearly impassable barrier be-
tween them and their rivals. This, coupled with the 
wild passages in the northeast, has allowed them 
to continue their existence in the Region. A few of 
the leaders of these goblins are starting to turn 
their superstitions into a counter-religion. If the 
new god is all-powerful, wouldn’t he have destroyed 
the maze for his followers? Since he has not, these 
rebel goblins believe the maze is the home of their 
old gods, the spirits in the rock their grandfathers’ 
grandfathers worshiped.
As the PCs make their way through this maze, its 
denizens and a series of traps confront them. Every 
30 minutes spent in Room B92, roll on the Special 
Encounters table, then roll on the second table for 
any special Encounter Conditions.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Unless treasure is rolled, the maze is empty 
of anything but debris and blood stains.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
roll for a Random Encounter every 15 minutes. To 
decrease the challenge, roll for a Random Encoun-
ter every hour.

Ivy clings to the walls, blocking visibility in the hallway. Wisdom (Perception) checks are made at 
disadvantage.
13The smell of rotted flesh assaults the PC’s senses. However, there is no visible source. Stagnant Air.
14The embers of a recent fire smolder, choking the air. Smoke.

The air crackles with energy, making the PCs feel alive and sick all at once. Negative Energy or 
Positive Energy.

1d3 bugbears wait in ambush, hoping to maim or kill someone before fleeing. Have PCs make 
two Wisdom (Perception) checks, using them as a single contested Dexterity (Stealth) check, with

they pass by their hiding spot.
17The monster or trap waits in the darkness, concealing itself in the shadows. Concealment.
18Debris has been placed to block the PCs’ path. Cover (total).

Silence and a magic null effect pervades the area, as if the walls were closing in on the PCs. Silence. 
Creatures here reroll failed saving throws against magical effects (spells, magic items, etc.).

B93-B108 . HEATHEN GOBLIN REBELS
Not all goblins fell in love with the new god. A small 
group held tight to the old ways, worshiping the 
power of the rock spirits as their ancestors had done 
for countless centuries before them. Once their king 
had been usurped, these rebellious goblins had no 
choice but to flee.
Fear of persecution overruled their fear of the 
dreaded maze to the east of the goblin lands. The 
goblins fled into its dangerous, confusing hallways 
eluding capture or other unsavory fates. Only two-
thirds of the goblins made it through the maze, but 
that was a far larger number than any of the fleeing 
rebels anticipated.
With the maze between them and their rivals, the 
goblins quickly went to work setting up a new home 
for themselves. They claimed the area in the south-
east corner of the dungeon as their own. The maze 
protects their western flank, while the wild treach-
erous passages to the north provide ample defense 
against raids by the goblin empire.
A chieftain named Guk leads these goblins. While 
not as clever as Argliss, he is smarter than most 
goblins. He is starting to think that the new deity is 
not as powerful as his supporters claim. Why has this 
deity not destroyed the maze? Why were the followers 
of the old ways allowed to escape? Guk believes the 
answer lies with his gods. The stone spirits are watch-
ing over his people and are rewarding their loyalty.
To Guk’s people the maze is not something to be 
scared of or frightened by; it is the home of their 
gods. They see now they were too ignorant to realize 
it before. Only the unwary are punished for tres-
passing in the home of the gods. Those truly devout 
and loyal can pass through as they wish. The rebels 
have used the maze to their advantage, both for 
protection and as a place from which to strike at the 
usurper’s empire.

1
The ground is littered with rubble and other 
detritus. Whether a trap caused this, or the 
earthquake that shook the dungeon so long 
ago, is unclear. What is apparent however is 
that the debris makes walking through this 
area very difficult. Hazardous Footing 15.
2-14Nothing.
15
A group of 1d3+1 ethereal marauders are 
exploring the dungeon and chance upon 
the PCs. Their attitude is Indifferent unless 
attacked. The ethereal marauders are curious 
about the PCs, they are used to goblinoids 
but not much else on two legs.
16
A pack of four blink dogs lazily make their 
way through the dungeon. Their attitude is 
Indifferent unless attacked.
17
A patrol of 2d4+2 rebel goblins, led by a 
goblin mounted on a worg, wind their way 
through the dungeon. These goblins are 
rebels, fighting the goblin king’s forces. 
If the PCs are allied with the goblin king, 
their attitude is Hostile. If the PCs are allied 
with the rebel goblin faction, their attitude 
is Indifferent. Otherwise, their attitude is 
Unfriendly.
18
A hobgoblin, mounted on a wounded worg, 
is being followed by 3d6+3 weary goblins. 
They have been raiding the rebel faction, and 
have suffered casualties. They are wary of an 
ambush and receive advantage on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks.

An ear-piercing shriek fills the dungeon as 
a pack of 2d4+1 howlers rounds the corner. 
They have been hunting goblins, but the PCs

B93. THE WATCH ROOM
When the PCs enter Room B93, read the following.
This room is filled with goblins. They stare at you 
blankly for a brief moment, before attacking.
After the PCs have dealt with the goblins, read this:
This room is small and cramped. It contains only 
an empty weapon rack against the eastern wall. 
The rebel goblins use this room as a staging area 
to launch attacks against the goblins in the west.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The rebel goblins are confused by the 
appearance of the PCs. They were planning a raid 
against the goblin king when the PCs entered the 
room. Thinking the PCs are agents of Argliss, they 
attack the PCs regardless of their true standing with 
the goblin king.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The goblins simply swarm the PCs, attacking 
them en masse. They attack the PCs closest to them 
without regard for their personal safety. They will 
not stop until either the PCs or they are subdued.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove 
two goblins.
B94 . THE SECRET ENTRANCE
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.
This small room is empty. The slate gray walls 
are blank and unadorned. On the far wall hangs 
a banner with a crude goblin sigil on it, perhaps 
defiantly opposing the goblin king.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This secret entrance is the only way into 
the rebel goblins’ new home. The rebel goblin chief-
tain, Guk, guided by the stone spirits, brought his 
people here. While Room B95 serves as their main 
hall, the goblins wisely decided to hide their new 
homes behind this hidden passage. The entrance 
is not guarded so it does not call attention to itself. 
The goblins rely on the dangers of the maze and 
the spiked pit trap (Room B1) in this room to defend 
against serious incursions from their cousins.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: A secret door in the eastern wall leads to 
Room B98. A DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check is required to locate the door’s latch, which is 
hidden behind the goblin banner. The secret door 
isn’t locked and opens easily. In the center of the 
room is a pit, carefully disguised to look like stone.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add 10 feet of depth to the spked pit trap. To reduce 
the difficulty, double the amount of temporary hit 
points granted to players caught in the trap.

183
B95. HALL OF THE REBELS
This room is huge and filled with goblins. 
Everywhere you turn you see them. Their cold, hate-
filled eyes stare back at you. A number hiss and 
spit, gripping their spears tighter. Just when you 
think the goblins will attack, a large goblin near the 
back of the room raises a hand and utters a simple 
command. The mass of goblins steps aside, forming 
a perfect aisle from the door to their chieftain.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This is the main room of the rebel 
goblins. Twenty rebel goblin warriors make their 
home here. From the hall, they meet and plan their 
raids, and the chieftain, Guk, holds what passes for 
his court. It is a simple room without ornamenta-
tion, save for a low, makeshift table in the center of 
the room and a single stool, used by Guk.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: Guk stops the goblins from attacking the PCs 
on sight. The chieftain is curious about them and 
wishes to know if they are in league with the goblin 
king, Argliss (Room B75). If the PCs convince Guk 
they are not allied with Argliss, he grants them safe 
passage through his encampment, provided the 
PCs do not disturb anything.
Guk also tries to enlist the PCs aid in his war 
against Argliss. He believes they have been brought 
to him by his gods. Why else would they be here if 
not to combat the usurper and restore order?
If Guk suspects the PCs of being allied with 
Argliss, he and the other goblins instantly turn 
Hostile and attack the PCs.
Like all rebels, these goblins lack hobgoblin 
training and the complex tactics their cousins use. 
The rebels use standard swarm tactics to over-
whelm and subdue the PCs.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add six goblins. To 
decrease the challenge, remove six.
B96 . STOREROOM
Constructed simply of gray stone, this room looks 
mostly like a makeshift storeroom. Dried rushes 
litter the floor, and the weapon racks are filled 
with spears. A few barrels are stacked against one 
wall. The remaining barrels reek of something 
unpleasant.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Located at the end of the hall, this room 
marks the beginning of the hidden goblin encamp-
ment. The rushes strewn around on the floor func-
tion as an early trespassing system. The door to the 
Rebel Barracks (Room B97) is thin, and the sound 
of anyone walking over the rushes alerts the goblins 
stationed there to potential intruders.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Allow goblins in Room B97 Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks, with advantage if the PCs walk on 
the rushes.
Treasure: A dozen short spears are stacked on 
the weapons rack and the barrels are filled with 
flammable oil.
Scaling: N/A
B97 . REBEL BARRACKS
If the goblins hear the PCs coming from Room B96, 
they fall into a defensive position, adding +4 to their 
initiative checks.
A small barrack houses a few dozen goblins, their 
spears are pointed menacingly in your direction, 
and they look ready to pounce on you at a 
moment’s notice. One goblin, dressed in a leather 
jerkin, with a badge of office affixed to its front, 
approaches you, demanding to know what you are 
doing here.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This is the first, and last, line of defense 
the rebel goblins have for their new home. Twelve 
goblins stand guard, at the ready to defend them-
selves from danger. If the PCs can convince the 
goblins they have made a pact with their chief-
tain, Guk, their attitude shifts to Indifferent. If the 
goblins believe the PCs are in league with Argliss’ 
goblins, their attitude shifts to Hostile and they 
immediately attack. If the PCs failed their Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks in Room B96, the goblins attack 
them as soon as they enter the room.
Encounter Condition: Fearless

184
Tactics: Like all rebels, these goblins lack hobgoblin 
training and the complex tactics their cousins use. 
They rely on standard swarm tactics to overwhelm 
and subdue the PCs. If given a chance, they flank a 
PC, but almost as if by accident.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add four goblins. 
To decrease the challenge, remove four.
B98 . REBEL ARMORY
Similar to the rest of the rooms in this section of 
the dungeon, this simple room is lined with weapon 
racks. Each rack holds simple, crudely crafted short 
spears. Along the back wall, a single, ornate brass-
and-iron long spear hangs by itself on the wall.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room serves as the main armory for 
the rebel goblins. Like their cousins, they still wield 
traditional spears. The weapon racks are filled with 
numerous spears, as well as an ornate long spear.
This room also contains a secret door on its 
eastern wall, requiring a DC 16 Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) check to locate. The door can be opened 
by pressing the top and bottom stones (pressure 
triggers) simultaneously. Goblins usually require a 
“boost” to open this door when passing through.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Aside from two dozen short spears, 
this room contains a masterwork longspear 
(+1 nonmagical spear).
Scaling: N/A
B100 . WEAPONSMITH
This square cell of a room is filled with long, 
straight sticks and bits of stone. In the middle of 
all this is a lone goblin, feverishly working on a new 
short spear. He does not appear to notice you... but 
maybe he does.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: The weaponsmith working here is Kr’n’g 
(a normal goblin). As long as the PCs do not dis-
rupt him, they can stay and watch him work. If they 
communicate with him he replies with grunts and 
gestures. He has work to do and cannot be both-
ered. If the rebel goblins see the PCs as enemies, he 
signals an alarm as soon as they enter. He lunges 
at the PCs with a half-made spear. 16 seconds later 
a squad of nine goblins arrive from Room B101 to 
assist the smith.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Kr’n’g defends himself against the PCs to 
the best of his ability, using the half-completed 
masterwork spear he is holding as his weapon. He 
goes on full defense each round, taking the Dodge 
action and waiting for reinforcements. After a few 
turns, Kr’n’g assumes reinforcements are on their 
way and fights less defensively. When the rein-
forcements arrive, they use standard rebel goblin 
swarm tactics.
Treasure: The room is filled with the parts to make 
three dozen masterwork spears, but nothing else.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, have 1d4 extra 
goblins arrive in the first round of combat. To 
decrease the challenge, have only five goblins arrive.
B99. SHRINE OF THE STONE SPIRITS
This room is dark and cool. The walls are dark, but 
somehow inviting as well. Scattered, seemingly 
at random, on the floor are a wide variety of 
carved stones.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room has been set up by Guk (Room 
B95) to honor the stone spirits the rebel goblins 
worship. If the PCs leave the room as they found 
it, they earn a measure of respect with the rebel 
goblins. Any alteration to the room is viewed as a 
crime and any alliance with the rebels is instantly 
terminated. Should word spread of the PCs’ actions, 
all further encounters with the rebels instantly have 
initial attitudes changed to Hostile.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 2
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Numerous carved stones line the floor. 
While they are valuable to the goblins, they are 
nearly worthless to anyone else. Argliss (Room B75) 
may find some use for them, however, and is will-
ing to offer a small reward for their retrieval.
Scaling: N/A

185
B101 . MEETING HALL
Wooden benches and tables line the walls and 
fill the room. Ten goblins, previously talking 
boisterously, grow quiet as you enter the room. 
This simply furnished room serves as the goblins’ 
communal room.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Unwelcome intruders, the PCs earn 
the glare of ten rebel goblin warriors, who have 
stopped their conversation to determine the fate of 
the PCs. As long as the attitude toward the PCs is 
not Hostile (in relation to the rebels), they are left 
alone. The goblins do not speak as long as the PCs 
are around. If the initial attitude toward the PCs 
is Hostile, or if they attack the goblins, the rebels 
assault the PCs immediately.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: These goblins have not been trained by 
the hobgoblins and do not have a handle on the 
complex tactics their cousins do. They fight with 
conviction (gaining +2 to Wisdom saving throws) 
but lack the tactical acumen of the goblins from 
the previous Section. The rebels swarm tactics and 
overwhelm the PCs, in an attempt to subdue them 
and hold them hostage.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, 
remove four.
B102 . CROWDED WORG STABLE
Growls, snapping jaws, and the stink of live 
animals, saturate the air. Four large, shaggy beasts 
are confined behind shaky-looking wooden pens. 
The wooden slats strain and buckle as the worgs 
try to free themselves. How the goblins ride these 
monsters into battle is unimaginable; the thought 
of taming them seems laughable enough.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Inside the pens, chained to the walls, are 
four worgs. They are vicious animals, slowly being 
turned mad by the Fear in this room. The goblins 
have placed them here, unsure why their tempera-
ment is so chaotic, but remain unwilling to relocate.
Encounter Condition: Fear 14, Fearless
Tactics: Since the worgs are chained up, it’s an easy 
kill if the PCs want to finish them. If the PCs get too 
close, the worgs attack. They cannot coordinate their 
attacks, however, and snap at anything in range.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
unchain the worgs. To decrease the challenge, have 
the worgs sleeping.
B103 . EMPTY WORG STABLE
The empty stable is devoid of anything of use 
to you. Hay bales line the wall and the floor 
is scattered with debris. The air is heavy and 
oppressive.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whether it was the death of a beast that 
lived here, or something else, the air in this room is 
impossible to breathe. The smell is foul and oppres-
sive, stinging the PCs’ eyes.
Encounter Condition: Negative Energy, Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs brave the odor and search the 
room, allow DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
checks to find a +1 silver dagger.
Scaling: N/A
B104 . SECRET PASSAGE
This room contains a secret door on both its east-
ern and western walls, requiring a successful DC 17 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate. The doors 
can be opened by pressing the top and bottom stones 
(pressure triggers) at the same time. Goblins usu-
ally require a “boost” to open this door when pass-
ing through.
The door on the eastern wall has a stack of barrels 
behind it, in the hopes of barring entry. A DC 14 
Athletics check is required to push it open from 
the outside.
This long, narrow corridor stretches along the 
southern end of the rebel encampment. From 
what you can tell it simply leads from one end to 
the other.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This passage is used frequently by the 
goblins, but is often kept locked or barred because 

186
whatever is living in Region C should be avoided. 
The goblins spent a great deal of time digging up 
stones and adding a spiked pit trap (Room B1) in the 
center of the hallway.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, increase depth of 
the spiked pit trap to 100 ft. To reduce the challenge, 
change the spiked pit trap to a pit trap (Room B40).
B105 . REMEMBERER'S HOVEL
Quaintly appointed, for a goblin’s home, this room 
is the most impressive in the encampment. The 
floor is covered with a rug made of some animal’s 
hide. Small carvings and markings adorn the walls. 
In the middle of the room sits a very old goblin. His 
skin is dull, leathery, and spotted.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: This room is the living quarters of the 
oldest goblin in the rebel faction. His name is 
Rememberer, and at nearly 15 years old, he is an-
cient. He is the last repository of the goblin culture 
before the coming of the new god. He remembers 
the stories and ways of his people, and gladly tells 
the PCs what he knows, hoping to find an heir for 
his knowledge before he passes into the rock. The 
PCs can learn much of the history of the goblins 
from the Rememberer. As long as the initial attitude 
does not shift to Hostile or the PCs threaten the 
Rememberer, he imparts his knowledge.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The Rememberer is quite old, and in no 
condition to fight off the PCs. Instead of fighting, 
he begins singing a song to fascinate the PCs. Allow 
the goblins in Room B101 a Wisdom (Perception) 
check each turn to hear the song. If they succeed, 
they arrive in 6d6 seconds to aid the Rememberer, 
fighting the PCs as if they had just harmed a goblin 
child. Once reinforcements arrive, they draw the 
PCs away from the Rememberer, allowing him to 
escape the room. Once safe, he flees to Room B95, 
while the goblins lead the PCs towards Room B97. 
If forced to remain in the room, the Rememberer 
aids the fighting goblins in battle. If he must escape 
he casts, expeditious retreat, and then pass without 
trace to disguise the direction he ran in.
Treasure: The Rememberer is familiar with the oral 
histones of his people. In addition, he wears a coral 
necklace (the origins of which are unknown to him) 
worth 50 gp. It is actually an Amulet of Proof against 
Detection and Location, but he doesn’t know that, 
because it doesn’t radiate magic.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
the reinforcements arrive at the end of the Remem-
berer’s first turn. To decrease the challenge, the 
reinforcements arrive at the end of the Remember-
er’s third turn.
B106 . THE REBEL CHIRURGEON
This room is a grisly mess. A few forlorn cots line 
the back wall. The lumpy shapes under the rotten 
cloth blankets leave little to the imagination. In 
the center of the room, standing over the lifeless 
body of a goblin, is the rebel’s chirurgeon, sewing 
together what is left of the dead soldier.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The goblin chirurgeon has just per-
formed surgery on a rebel goblin, to no avail. 
While Guk (Room B95) calls upon the power of the 
stone spirits, he’s not adept at healing. This young 
goblin chirurgeon has been tasked with fixing the 
raiders that return to the encampment, which is 
becoming more and more of a losing proposition. 
He is frightened and skittish and does not like the 
presence of the PCs one bit. Black, his bat familiar, 
is here too.
If attacked the chirurgeon flees, crying for help. 
If he alerts the guards housed in Room B97, they 
arrive a turn later.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The chirurgeon does everything in his power 
to escape the PCs. While he has a few spells at his 
disposal, he casts burning hands if cornered and 
sleep if he sees someone casting spells. Once the 
guards arrive they assist the chirurgeon and attack 
the PCs. Like all rebels, these goblins lack hobgob-
lin training and the complex tactics their cousins 
use. The rebels use standard swarm tactics to over-
whelm and subdue the PCs. They guard the adept 
as best as they can, and look menacing if necessary.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add four goblins. 
To decrease the challenge, remove four goblins.

187
B107. GUK'S QUARTERS
Large and empty, this room is much nicer than 
others in the area. While spartan, a large sleeping 
area has been made up in the middle of the 
room, and various hides and weapons cover 
the walls. Leaning against the back wall is a 
club, with a wicked-looking spike of iron driven 
through its head.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Guk (Room B95) and the majority of 
rebels, aside from those in the secret encampment, 
are still in Room B95. If the PCs have gotten this far 
they either have Guk’s trust, or the PCs have already 
dealt with the rebel chieftain.
The hides and weapons on the walls are testa-
ments to the goblin kings of the past. They are all 
Guk could smuggle out during his exodus from 
Argliss’ regime. Guk’s personal greatclub is here; he 
does not feel he needs to wield it in the safety of his 
own hall and leaves it in this room when he is not 
raiding his cousins to the west.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs have somehow yet to meet Guk, 
there is a 50% chance he is here alone, and startled 
to find strangers in his quarters. His initial attitude 
is Unfriendly, as he does not trust foreigners.
Treasure: Guk’s +1 greatclub is the only significant 
treasure in the room. The weapons on the walls are 
standard spears and short swords. They are all old 
and rusty, however.
Scaling: N/A
B108. REBEL GUARD ROOM
This room, like many in this area, is filled with 
spear-wielding goblins. Along the north wall is a 
weapon rack filled with sharpened wooden spears 
and javelins. Apparently nothing has threatened 
them recently, as they look quite bored and eager 
for a fight.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This room is staffed by ten of Guk’s 
goblin warriors. They monitor the northern passag-
es for incursions by the goblin king’s forces. Occa-
sionally they hunt the creatures that wander into 
these halls from the untamed rooms (Rooms B109 
through B131).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: These goblins are bored and agitated with 
their assignment. They are looking for anything 
distracting. If their attitude with the PCs is anything 
but Hostile, they strike up a conversation (in Goblin) 
or offer to play knucklebones or cards. If the PCs 
have Guk’s favor, they even offer them places to sit 
and relax, eager for company.
If the attitude is currently Hostile, the rebel 
goblins tear into the PCs, fighting with a fierceness 
they have not seen in goblins. Treat the goblins as 
enraged (per the barbarian rage class ability) and 
give them a +2 to their initiative.
Like all rebels, these goblins have not been 
trained by the hobgoblins and do not have the 
complex tactics their cousins do. However, they are 
fond of flanking and poking the PCs at every turn. 
One of them has a vial of acid and another one has 
dragon bile smeared on his blade (3 doses). Any 
goblin that cannot get in to fight the PCs, throws a 
spear (increase their “shortbow” damage to 1d8 to 
represent this) overhead in an attempt to harm PC 
spellcasters and those hanging back. They move to 
the weapon’s rack to retrieve more if necessary.
Treasure: There are three spears and three javelins for 
every goblin in a weapons rack along the north wall. 
It requires a bonus action to grab one. Large or 
larger creatures can grab two in one go.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove 
four goblins.

188
B109-B119 . THE UNTAMED ROOMS
None of the goblinoid races lay claim to this rub-
ble-filled expanse. The earthquake hit this part of 
the dungeon hardest. A number of the traps orig-
inally laid down have been destroyed. Blink dogs, 
dire wolves, howlers, and other monsters make their 
home in this rough expanse. Howls, high-pitched 
whining, and growls echo throughout the hallways.
The hallways are strewn with rubble and debris. 
Most of the rubble is the facing of the walls that came 
loose. Some of it is the remains of walls. The footing 
is treacherous and the wild monsters make the area 
dangerous. There are good reasons the goblinoids 
have not settled the area previously.
With the shrine to their new deity in the northeast-
ern section of this expanse, Argliss and his goblins be-
gan entering the area more frequently. They even set 
up a way station for pilgrims and scouts to stay during 
the arduous trip from their empire to the shrine.
The bugbears have used the long, dangerous trip 
of the goblins to their advantage. They too have set 
up a small bivouac. From it, they harass the goblin 
pilgrims and scouts. Their presence, coupled with the 
naturally wild monsters, makes this perhaps the most 
volatile area in the entire Region.
Each room is assumed to have Poor Footing 3 in 
addition to any other Encounter Conditions.

B109. PASSAGES OF DEATH
The door on the northern wall is open. Rubble and 
broken, armored skeletons, and other detritus litter 
the hall. Ominous sounds emanate from the west 
of the room, echoing off the cavernous walls. To the 
east is a small passage leading away into darkness.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: When the demon Falortuligo broke from 
its prison in Room C21, he broke into Region B 
through the doors here and finally into Room B111 
where he was killed. The skeletons are a few of the 
paladins who died fighting him.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Haunted, 
Hazardous Footing 15, Unhallowed
Tactics: Just being here should unnerve the PCs. 
The sights, sounds, and sensations of these dead 
soldiers combine to create an aura of uneasy death. 
These men died horribly. Close examination of the 
bodies shows parts of bone missing from the ribs, 
legs, jaws, and arms as if some great force tore 
them away before they died.
Treasure: There are a total of three skeletons, each 
wearing a +1 chain shirt, with masterwork long-
swords (+1 nonmagical longswords) on their belts, 
and tabards of the Order of Myrunn still hanging 
on their broken frames. One of the bodies wears a 
generic signet ring (with a cross) that can double as 
a silver holy symbol, should a PC require one.

B110. FRIGHTENED AND ALONE
The northern door to this room is locked, requiring a 
DC 24 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to unlock. The 
southeastern door to this room is locked, requiring a 
DC 27 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to unlock.
Unless the PCs succeed at a DC 25 Dexterity 
(Stealth) check while opening the lock, read the 
following.
Sitting in the corner of this dark and empty room 
is a single goblin. His eyes are streaked with tears 
as he shakes fearfully, barely managing to hold a 
sharpened stick to defend himself.
If the PCs succeed in picking the lock quietly, read 
the following.
The room is dark and empty. In one of the comers, 
a single goblin whimpers and cries to himself. His 
hands tremble as he stares at the sharpened stick 
in his hand.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: This rebel goblin, Klibb (a normal, if 
somewhat pathetic goblin possessing an above-av-
erage Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) of +6), has been 
locked inside this room for 3 days. Fearing whatever 
is in Room B111, he locked himself in this room. 
However, in doing so, he broke off his pick in one 
of the locks and has been unable to escape. To 
make matters worse, the room is haunted and he’s 
been unable to sleep with the noises, chattering, 
and unexplained shadows hovering around him all 
night long. He’s down to one last candle for light 
but refuses to use it for fear that he may be in this 
room for a long while yet.
Encounter Condition: Haunted
Tactics: Klibb does not want to fight and gladly 
throws himself at the mercy of the PCs. If they in-
tend to kill him he greets death willingly, though if 
they leave an opening for escape he takes it. If they 
offer to let him join, he gladly accepts and escorts 
them wherever they want to go.
This is a perfect opportunity to drop a new PC 
into the group. If a goblin is not on the menu of 
acceptable races for players, replace Klibb with just 
about anything that fits, including an elf deserter 
from Region H. It makes the most sense for Klibb 
(or his replacement) to be a rogue, but if another 
goblin lies dead in the room who actually locked 
the doors from the inside, Klibb can be any class.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: Do not increase or decrease the challenge of 
this encounter.

B111. KILLING GROUNDS
This room is evil; you can feel it in your bones. 
The floor is covered in debris and is slightly tacky. 
Any sound you make, as well as a few others, echo 
throughout the chamber loudly. To say you have 
a bad feeling about this cavernous room is an 
understatement.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This is perhaps the most dangerous room 
in the entire Region. An epic battle took place here 
ages ago (see Region C) and the effects of the battle 
still linger. The conditions of the room are tough 
to handle, but that is not the worst of it. Soon 
after the PCs enter the room, six corrupted ghoul 
paladins—dressed in magical chain mail, carry-
ing unholy swords, and wearing the tabards of the 
Order of Myrunn—attack the PCs. They are fearless 
and descend without hesitation, merely waiting for 
the appropriate moment to strike.
They do not look like typical ghouls. While their 
skin is tight, eyes hollow, and claws sharpened to 
razor-like perfection, they carry themselves with re-
gal authority and wield swords as though they were 
born to. Their helmets hide everything but their 
fangs and empty eyes. Their weapons gleam with 
unnerving energy.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Concealment, Cursed 
5, Desecration 6, Echoes 10, Fear 14, Fearless, 
Haunted, Hazardous Footing 16, Negative Energy, 
Unhallowed
Tactics: The ghouls alternate between bite, claw, and 
longsword attacks. They know that a paralyzed vic-
tim is easier to subdue, but they cannot deny their 
paladin heritage. They maintain an aura of fear, in 
addition to the Fear effect of the room.
The ghouls work like a team, ganging up on 
stragglers and distracting the weak. They have a 
strong hatred for clerics and wizards (seeing Arum 
as the cause of their death). They do not put them-
selves in harm’s way but do their best to kill spell-
casters before they can “boost” the PCs.
If the PCs cannot dispatch the ghouls quickly 
enough, they run the risk of drawing the atten-
tion of other nearby monsters. After 11 rounds of 
combat, roll for a Random Encounter. If the result 
is odd, the Random Encounter occurs, forcing the 
PCs to deal with even more foes. If not, roll again 
on the 12th round of combat. If the result is even, 
the Random Encounter occurs. Do not roll for fur-
ther encounters beyond this point.
Treasure: Having rotted their magical weapons and 
armor from their caustic and unholy touch, their 
swords and chain shirts turn to dust when the 
ghouls die.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one corrupted paladin. To decrease the chal-
lenge, remove the magical arms and armor from 
the corrupted paladins.

B112-B115 . PRISON CELLS
While part and parcel of the surrounding Section, these four rooms have specific significance. They are prison 
cells that at one time or another held demons, devils, and undead. Some of the rooms still have occupants
B112 . DARKNESS AGAIN
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. Unlike 
the other rooms in this area, the glyph on this door 
triggers the door to open when read.
This simple room is empty and dark. Light recedes 
and dissipates, almost swallowed by the darkness. 
The floor, from what you can see, is strangely 
free of dust.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whatever once lived here is gone, having 
escaped when a foolish goblin read the glyph on the 
door. Most likely a wight, it either escaped into the 
dungeon or was killed by the ghouls in Room B111.
Encounter Condition: Deep Darkness, Desecration 3, 
Negative Energy
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs spend 30 minutes searching the 
room (and have adequate light), allow a DC 20 In-
telligence (Investigation) check to find a loose stone 
in the floor. A DC 11 Strength (Athletics) check lifts 
the stone from its perch. The stone is nearly 200 
lbs. and covers a small area the size of a halfling. 
Buried under the stone is a suit of +1 unholy splint 
mail, obviously hidden away so it could never be 
used against the forces of good. It radiates evil and 
afflicts good-aligned PCs who don it with a Har-
rowing Curse.
Unholy armor grants resistance to damage 
dealt by good-aligned creatures. In addition, when 
the wearer is struck, the attacker must succeed a 
Charisma saving throw (DC 14) or be afflicted with a 
Harrowing Curse.
 '
Harrowing Curse. Until it is removed, or one week 
passes, cursed creatures that roll initiative must 
succeed a Wisdom saving throw (DC 14) or be 
frightened of all undead for 10 turns. The save may 
be repeated at the end of each of their turns. Crea-
tures already in combat when this curse is applied 
must immediately make the save again.
Scaling: N/A
B113 . TRAPPED WIGHT
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 24 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. In ad-
dition, the door is trapped with a glyph of warding, 
protecting the contents of the room from escape. 
Tampering with the door or lock in any manner 
triggers it.
A small tomb-like room rests to the northeast of 
the large circular room. The contents are spartan 
and darkness extends to every comer. Before you 
can think, something has crept from the shadows.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Two insane wights have been trapped in 
this room since its creation. Being undead, they 
do not understand the passage of time as humans 
do but nonetheless have maintained a semblance 
of reality that finally drove them mad. Insane, they 
howl with an allip-like moan.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Distract-
ing Noises, Fear 15, Fearless, Unhallowed
Tactics: The insane wights attack immediately, taking 
advantage of surprised PCs. They babble incessant-
ly, as they attack each PC in turn.
Treasure: If the PCs have adequate light, allow a 
DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find a 
series of loose flagstones in the floor. Buried under 
the stones is a +1 unholy morningstar, obviously 
hidden away so it could never be used against the 
forces of good. A DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check 
lifts the stones.
Unholy weapons deal an extra 1d4 necrotic dam-
age to good-aligned creatures. In addition, when a 
creature is struck by the weapon, it must succeed a 
Charisma save (DC 14) or be afflicted with a Har-
rowing Curse (Room 112). Good-aligned creatures 
touching unholy weapons are instantly afflicted 
with the curse.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one wight. To decrease the challenge, remove 
the allip-like babbling ability from the wights.

and all the doors are locked and guarded by glyphs. GMs can describe the doors while the PCs stand in 
Room B111, but until they touch them, there is no chance of knowing what will happen.
B114 . HELL ON EVERY EARTH
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. In addi-
tion, the door is trapped with a glyph of warding (3rd 
level, explosive, thunder), protecting the contents of 
the room from escape. Tampering with the door or 
lock in any manner triggers it.
From the darkness, you can hear an unhealthy 
moan, something sinister and decrepit. The 
darkness cuts your torchlight and the moan grows 
louder as you peer into the shadows.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A ghast of unusual strength has been 
trapped in this room since the dungeon’s creation. 
Once shackled, it broke those bonds long ago. Now 
the manacles and chains hang from a metal ring in 
the wall. The floor is littered with sepsis and slime, 
making walking difficult.
The ghast has no love of the living and attacks 
immediately.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Conceal-
ment, Fearless, Poor Footing 4, Unhallowed
Tactics: Taking advantage of the darkness, the ghast 
rushes the first PC, in an attempt to pin him. Using 
the darkness to his advantage he gains a +4 to 
his Strength check to grapple them. Once on the 
ground, he attacks ferociously, biting and clawing 
until the victim is paralyzed. He then moves on to 
the next victim using the same tactics, paralyzing 
the PC and moving on to the next.
The ghast is a fearsome predator and uses its 
mechanisms to finish off the PCs.
Treasure: If the PCs spend 30 minutes searching the 
room (and have adequate light), they can find a bro-
ken stone in the floor. A DC 9 Strength (Athletics) 
check lifts the pieces of broken stone easily. Noth-
ing is buried here, having been taken by the ghast.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, give the ghast +3 
AC. To reduce the challenge, remove the ghast’s 
teeth, forcing it to fight only with its claws.
B115 . SEVERED VARGOUILLES
From outside the door, the PCs can hear the muf-
fled shriek of something far off. In actuality, the 
vargouilles inside are shrieking at a fever pitch, but 
the walls of the dungeon suppress the volume of 
their screams. As soon as the door is opened, the 
shriek hits them at full volume.
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. In addi-
tion, the door is trapped with a glyph of warding (3rd 
level, explosive, fire), preventing the contents of the 
room from escaping. Tampering with the door or lock 
in any manner triggers it.
As soon as the door opens a feverish shriek 
blasts your senses, striking your psyche with an 
impossibly loud sound. The room, shrouded in 
darkness, shows no signs of occupants, but the 
shrieks cannot be ignored.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: From the darkness, four vargouilles shriek 
and scream. The PCs cannot see them because it’s 
dark, but if they can get closer, they see four heads 
spiked to iron rods in the wall, some ten feet above 
the floor. Striking them should be easy enough, 
should the PCs have a weapon that can reach them.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Distracting 
Noises, Deep Darkness, Fear 14
Tactics: The vargouilles are spiked to the walls, un-
able to move, but unwilling to die. They have been 
shrieking for thousands of years, trapped in this 
constant state of agony. Unable to deny their un-
holy heritage, they scream continuously, no matter 
what the PCs do. They cannot move, and want noth-
ing more than to be free of this living hell they are 
trapped in. Death is the most obvious answer, but 
escape is their goal.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, do not have the 
vargouilles spiked to the wall but flying about at 
will. To decrease the challenge, reduce each var-
gouille to 1 hit point each, representing the con-
stant state of near death that they “live” in.

193
B116 . ISOLATED REBELS
As the PCs approach this room, allow Wisdom 
(Perception) checks to overhear the goblins inside, 
counting and bickering. While not hostile toward 
one another, or shouting, they are busy dividing up 
their loot.
There is a 50% chance one goblin stands guard in 
front of the door. Otherwise, everyone is inside, with 
one goblin watching the door from the back wall.
This small, cramped room is filled with rebel goblin 
warriors, sitting down and sifting through a small 
pile of coins and gems. Before you can do anything, 
they grab their spears and attack.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Nine goblin warriors left Room B108 out 
of boredom. Wishing to explore the dungeon, they 
braved the maze, snuck passed the goblins in Room 
B86 and so on, and made their way through the 
trapped rooms in the center of the Region.
None of this was difficult, but the goblin keeping 
track of where they were going died under a port-
cullis trap and they have been stuck in this Section 
for weeks now. The other goblins in the rebel en-
campment presume they are dead. Since they have 
been gone for so long, they do not know whether 
the PCs are loyal to the rebels or not. As such, they 
are treated no better than their traitorous cousins. 
Unless the PCs can show some sign of their alle-
giance to the rebel goblins (and quickly), they are 
attacked as soon as the PCs enter the room.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises
Tactics: These goblins are ragged and frazzled, their 
mental state shaken for the duration of this fight. 
They attack with an intense need to kill. The PCs 
should be allowed a chance to calm them down 
(spells work, for instance). If 50% of the goblins 
come to their senses, they all stop fighting and in-
vite the PCs in, hoping they can guide them home.
The goblins have encountered the blink dogs in 
Room B117 but keep to themselves, knowing better 
than to antagonize the beasts.
Treasure: While exploring, they were able to collect 
a small pile of treasure that they were divvying up 
(for the 40th time) when the PCs interrupted. There 
are 116 sp, 23 gp, an uncut sapphire (350 gp), and a 
potion of gaseous form.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add three goblins. 
To decrease the challenge, remove two.
B117 . BLINK DOG DEN
The door to this room is open, its lock broken.
In the midst of all the chaos in this section of 
the dungeon, this room feels safe. An easy calm 
washes over you and the room itself seems to be 
an enticing place to rest. The peace is broken as a 
series of low growls fill the air.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The PCs have entered a blink dog den. 
Resting from the rigors of the Section, four blink 
dogs (hp 40, 32, 24, 14) rest on beds of cloth and 
adventuring gear. They do not attack the PCs initial-
ly, but they make their dislike of the PCs’ invasion 
clear. The blink dogs bare their fangs, growling 
and yapping at the PCs. If the PCs do not leave, the 
blink dogs slowly advance, hoping to drive them off. 
If any PCs attack, they immediately retaliate.
Any ranger or druid amongst the PCs can at-
tempt a DC 20 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check 
to calm the dogs. Success allows the PCs to remain 
and rest in the room though the blink dogs are 
obviously not pleased with the PCs’ presence.
Encounter Condition: [Safe]
Tactics: The three largest blink dogs launch them-
selves at the PCs, with the alpha male protecting 
the smallest and youngest blink dog. They focus on 
the most aggressive PCs first, concentrating on one 
enemy at a time. They use their limited blink ability 
to flank the PCs.
If the alpha male is killed, the second largest 
takes command of the pack. If it dies, the remain-
ing blink dogs cower in a comer until the PCs leave 
or finish them off.
The smallest is too old to train at this point, 
having been feral too long to be of use to animal 
trainers. However, since blink dogs are lawful 
good creatures, they prefer not to fight. But be-
ing trapped in the dungeon, they grow more and 
more feral with the passage of time. Rangers and 
druids may attempt to calm the blink dogs, requir-
ing a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check in place of 
Charisma (Diplomacy) checks. If the PCs remain for 
2 hours or more, another check is required, lest the 
alpha male grow restless.
If the PCs clear the goblins out of B116 and keep 
the portcullis in Room B118 down, this room is 
considered Safe.

194
Treasure: Among the adventuring gear the blink dogs 
were resting on are two coils of 50 ft. rope, a back-
pack, six candles, a tinder box, a rusty carving knife, 
and a waterskin filled with holy water.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one blink dog. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.
B118 . MOSS-FILLED GUARD 
CHAMBER
The portcullis blocking the PC’s path is down. In or-
der to open it, the PCs must pull the lever (inside the 
room) down.
Deep green moss covers the walls and ceiling of 
this room. The only bare stone is the floor. The 
moss is rich and thick, taking on the appearance 
of an expensive carpet. The air in this room is 
thick and pungent as well. The moss appears to be 
sucking all the freshness out of the room. Along the 
west wall, a lever juts out.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The walls and ceiling of this room are the 
remnants of an ancient celestial trap that was dam-
aged in the earthquake. Touching the lever triggers 
a poison dust trap, but opens the portcullis.
 '
Poison Dust Trap. Hidden inside the lever compart-
ment is a glass vial (visible with a DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception check)). Pulling the lever crushes the 
vial releasing a puff of noxious gas. Creatures 
within 5 ft of the lever must succeed a Constitution 
saving throw (DC 15) or be poisoned for 1 hour. If 
the poison is not cured before that time the victim 
receives 5d10 poison damage when it ends. A DC 14 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check is required to 
pull the vial out without dropping it, which would 
set it off.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: Along the western wall is a lever that, when 
pulled down, raises the portcullis in the hallway. 
When pushed up, the portcullis lowers.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the poison dust trap’s effect with insanity 
mist vapor (Room B8). To decrease the challenge, 
remove the trap and raise the portcullis.
B119 . ABANDONED OUTPOST
The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 30 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. The door 
can be locked from the inside or outside.
This room was once an outpost of some sort; that 
much is obvious at least. A rotted framework, 
probably for bunk beds, leans against one wall. A 
large, stained table takes up the center of the room. 
On the eastern wall, there is a slight discoloration 
in the center from a map that once hung there. 
Along the back wall is a weapons rack.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This outpost has been abandoned for 
a long time. The furniture is old, and the floor is 
littered with rubble and debris.
No matter how long the PCs search the room, 
they cannot determine who used the room, or what 
they used it for; it dates back to the time of the 
battle that took place in Room B111. The map that 
hung on the wall has long since been destroyed, 
and the only things on the table are dark stains. The 
weapon rack in the back of the room seems to be in 
decent repair and still holds a few weapons.
Encounter Condition: Hazardous Footing 5, [Safe]
Tactics: If the PCs lock the door from the inside, 
nothing can get in to disturb them. The locals con-
sider this room unreachable anyway.
Treasure: At first glance, the weapon’s rack appears 
trapped, but a DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check reveals that the trigger is fake, designed to 
trick would-be thieves. Over the years the “tripline” 
has rotted and nothing resembling a trap remains.
The weapons of a long-dead soldier hang on the 
weapon rack, holding a +1 longbow and a +1 buckler 
in addition to a few mundane odds and ends. The 
GM should place a few javelins and arrows on the 
rack for PCs to replenish their supplies.
Scaling: N/A

B120-B132 . RUINS
The fallout from the earthquake can still be felt here. 
Doors are broken open from the inside. Unholy 
screams fill the corridors. And everywhere the PCs go, 
the smell of death follows them. This place is unfit for 
the living... let alone the dead.
Unlike the majority of the Region, this expanse suf-
fered real damage. The halls are strewn with rubble 
and debris that make traversing them an adventure 
in and of itself. Doors are broken from the inside, 
hanging on their hinges, allowing a glimpse into the 
shadowy confines of the rooms beyond. On top of 
all the damage, there is still the matter of the inhabi-
tants wandering the halls.
The goblins and bugbears may have control over 
their respective sections, but this section is ruled by 
wild creatures and untamed monsters. This makes 
pilgrimages to the shrine that much more difficult as 
beasts threaten the goblins at every turn. This Section 
is not safe.
To add to the disturbing nature of the Section, the 
stench of death and decay permeates the very air. The 
creatures here do not coexist peacefully and between 
their encounters with each other and the goblins that 
enter this area surreptitiously. The results of various 
conflicts have saturated the dungeon. Dark stains, 
scattered bones, and broken weapons mark the vio-
lence of these meetings. Compared to the relatively 
spartan and benign rooms in the other areas, this 
entire section radiates a dangerous aura.
The GM should add the following Encounter Con-
ditions as he sees fit: Echoes 4, Poor Footing 4, and 
Stagnant Air.
Every room’s door is either open or broken off.

B120 . THE CROSSROADS
The enormity of this room astounds you. Its sheer, 
white walls and bleached granite ceiling are truly 
impressive. Less impressive are the red scrawled 
runes carved and painted on the walls. The writing 
is hard to decipher, but it appears to be a series of 
taunts and proclamations from one group to the 
other. The center of the room is likewise stained. 
Upon closer inspection, it appears to be blood.
In addition to the room’s decor, there is an 
unmistakable smell of rot. While the smell isn’t 
overpowering, it isn’t comfortable either.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Bugbears use this room to lure their en-
emies into a series of traps, all simple but effective. 
Typically, the bugbears run through the room, and 
exit through any one of a number of doors, press-
ing hidden triggers as they go. In actuality, this trick 
has worked nearly a dozen times, and each time the 
bugbears reset the traps, they prepare for another 
wave of gullible victims.
Pressure-sensitive plates underneath the floor 
trigger the first trap, which in turn triggers two 
more. PCs stepping across the floor require a DC 12 
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check 
to avoid triggering the first hail of needles trap. PCs 
that are moving quickly suffer disadvantage on 
this check.
After the hail of needles trap (Room B35), a poison 
dust trap (Room B118) goes off, followed by a spiked 
pit trap (Room B1) in the floor (with a 6-second gap 
between each trap). To make matters worse, the pit 
is lined with spikes. Presently three dead goblins 
line the bottom of the pit, all of which are decom-
posing and covered in maggots.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: To safely cross the room the PCs need to lo-
cate the reset mechanism, which is located beneath 
a chipped tile in the northwestern corner of the 
room. There are three separate triggers, each to a 
different trap. A fourth trigger leads to the delay 
between the traps, allowing the PCs the opportunity 
to alter the intervals between the traps from 1 round 
to 6 rounds. This requires a DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight 
of Hand) check.
There is a 10% chance that two bugbears are in 
this room resetting and rearming the traps. If so, 
they are Unfriendly to the PCs, having never seen 
humans (etc.) before.
Treasure: Tucked in the southwest corner are two 
dead goblins, maybe 2 or 3 days old. They are cov-
ered in needles and their clothing is torn to shreds. 
The PCs require a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) or 
DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find 
these bodies. They have 1d4 sp each in their mauled 
pockets, but the bugbears have stripped everything 
else away.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a fire trap (Room B18) that goes off at the bot-
tom of the pit. To decrease the challenge, remove 
the fungal dust vapor trap.
B121 . BUGBEAR BIVOUAC
This small room has been taken over by a group of 
bugbears. They bark and growl at you as you enter, 
tightening their grip on their clubs. The bugbears 
seem wary and tired, waiting for you to make the 
first move.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Three bugbear soldiers use this location 
to harass the goblin pilgrims traveling to the shrine 
(Room B134). Any disruption of the goblin king’s 
minions is seen as a victory to the bugbears and 
they take full advantage of the long trip many gob-
lins make to visit their deity.
If the PCs can convince the bugbears they are 
friends, their attitude shifts to Indifferent and they 
allow the PCs to make use of the room to rest. If 
the bugbears believe the PCs are allied with either 
faction of goblins, their attitude instantly becomes 
Hostile and they attack the PCs.
Encounter Condition: [Safe]
Tactics: The bugbears know they are outmatched, and 
avoid a fight if possible. They gang up on the near-
est PC and use them as a human shield if possible. 
They stay close together, making sure they cannot 
be flanked, engaging the PCs en masse only when 
safe, and taking down opponents as quickly as pos-
sible—they know the cost of a protracted fight.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one bugbear and change their initial attitude to 
Hostile. To decrease the challenge, have the bug-
bears out on patrol, only to return in 1d6 minutes.

B122 . WAYWARD AND LOST
Have the effects of this room carry out 30 ft. or so 
from the room, causing the PCs to become confused 
before they reach the interior. The doors to this room 
are broken or missing.
All around you, the walls and floor dance with 
wavy heat lines, moving from you. Your vision 
blurs and the boundaries of the room grow more 
confusing, shifting in front of you. Suddenly your 
ears begin to ring and your balance is disrupted. 
On the ground, dead bodies of goblins and wolves 
twist and writhe. Their heads move as though 
barking, but no sound comes out.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Whatever magic created in this room 
has become tainted, twisting the PC’s minds and 
feeding them hallucinations. This takes effect every 
1d4 minutes (per PC) and the effects are cumulative 
(frightened becomes restrained, restrained becomes 
paralyzed), so spending long in this room can be 
dangerous for the PC’s well-being.
Encounter Condition: Deep Silence, Fear 15
Tactics: PCs remaining in the room suffer the effects 
of confusion (no save) until they leave. The GM is 
encouraged to make the room difficult to escape.
Treasure: The goblins each carry 1d3 mundane items 
and there is one minor magic item under the body 
of the dire wolf, but the PCs are lucky to escape this 
room, let alone find time to search the dead.
Scaling: N/A
B123 . PIT OF DESPAIR
A deep pit takes up the center of this room. The 
walls have been broken from the weight of extreme 
stress, and gears and other mechanical devices 
are exposed. Obviously, a trap of some sort was 
the centerpiece of this room at one point, but it 
appears to be inoperable now. Still, for a room that 
seems relatively safe, why do you feel so unnerved?
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Once a great celestial trap filled this 
room, now the innards of the trap lay exposed. It 
was either damaged by the great earthquake or 
ruined by the bugbears; it is impossible to be sure.
There is a presence in the room, be it a creature 
that fell to the trap while it was still active, or some-
thing living at the bottom of the pit, and it is quite 
unnerving. The longer the PCs stay in this room, 
the more unnerved they become.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Distracting 
Visions, Echoes, Fear 15, Haunted
Tactics: For every hour the PCs spend in this room, 
they must make another fear save, increasing the 
DC by +1 for every previous check.
Treasure: A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals 
a series of claw marks in the stone that could only 
come from the acidic touch of a demon or other 
creature. The stone is still hot from whatever made 
the marks. The marks radiate evil and strong trans-
mutation. If the PCs spend 30 minutes collecting 
the molten pieces of stone from the wall, they can 
use them as special material components for 1d3 
castings. Usable for any spell with a duration or 
range, the stones, touched by great evil, taint the 
magic with evil energy, doubling the duration and 
range of the spell. A DC 25 Intellegince (Arcana) 
check reveals that the molten stone (once chipped 
away) can aid their castings of spells.
Scaling: N/A

B124. CRYPT OF THE HOBGOBLIN KINGS
The door on the northeastern wall is open.
This room is filled with rubble and debris. Most of 
it appears to have been a part of a large statue at 
some point. The details have been destroyed, but 
from what you can tell it looks like the statue was 
of a fearsome celestial. A haze of smoke fills the 
ceiling, giving the impression that something (or 
someone) was burned here recently. A slag of cloth 
and flesh rests against the north wall, just below 
the broken statue.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room served as a burial place for var-
ious creatures in the Section. The statue, thought of 
as a guardian, or watcher of the dead, was offered 
burnt remains or whatever religious items of signif-
icance could be procured by visitors. Various races 
have used this room over the years and presently, 
the bugbears use it to burn their dead.
Even though the statue has crumbled with age 
and as a result of neglect, the creatures in the 
Section treat it with reverence. From time to time, 
whatever they can find is offered and laid to rest at 
its base. Usually, these coins and trinkets are taken 
by foolish or greedy goblins, but from time to time 
a small pile of silver can be found here.
Encounter Condition: Hazardous Footing 5, 
Positive Energy
Tactics: Sifting through the debris should take some 
time. A Random Encounter every 45 minutes or 
so is a good way to convince the PCs not to “hang 
around” too long.
Treasure: In the northwest corner of the room, under 
a large stone, is a hidden compartment, cut out 
from the floor. The compartment is about the size 
of a small coffin and requires a successful Wisdom 
(Perception) check (DC 18) to locate. The compart-
ment has become a repository for discarded items. 
Various tremors in the room have buried it, howev-
er, and no one has “donated” to the compartment 
in years. A few discarded weapons and trinkets 
can be found as well as a +1 steel shield, and three 
potions of giant strength. If the GM likes, add a few 
hundred silver pieces as well.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add the Encounter Condition: Smoke. To decrease 
the challenge, remove the Hazardous Footing 5 
Encounter Condition.
B125. FIGHT FOR DOMINANCE
The north and south doors to this room are open.
As the PCs approach, allow them Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks to hear the fighting, growling, and 
baying taking place in this room. Otherwise, they only 
hear the animals after they open one of the doors.
Three yellow-brown hounds are fighting against a 
pair of large, feral wolves. They snarl and bark at 
one another, neither giving in nor backing down. 
The fighting is quick and brutal.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: If the PCs remain still, the three blink 
dogs and two dire wolves continue fighting (al-
though allow Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice 
the PCs). If the fight continues, both groups bite 
and attack one another until they are at 50% hit 
points at which point they flee north (dire wolves) 
and south (blink dogs). The wolves wear collars, 
indicating that someone possibly “owns” them.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs are noticed, both groups turn 
their attention and attack, splitting their energies 
between the PCs and their four-legged enemies. 
The GM should “mix it up” and make this melee as 
chaotic as it sounds.
The blink dogs here, while neutral good, are in 
a state of fury and not willing to explore whether 
the PCs are “good” or not. Consider these animals 
enraged (per the barbarian's rage class feature).
Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks are made at 
disadvantage.
Treasure: The wolves wear nice leather collars, but 
nothing else of value is in this room. Heavy traffic 
keeps it clear of debris.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one dire wolf and two blink dogs. To decrease 
the challenge, remove one dire wolf.

199
B126. CELESTIAL OBSERVATORY
The northern door to this room is locked and cannot 
be opened without the key in Room C105.
This room is a mess of rubble and cracked stone. 
After careful examination you can make out the 
remains of a stone desk and chair along one 
side of the room. Towards the back of the room 
are the broken pieces of what could only be a 
bookcase or shelf.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The purpose of this room has been lost to 
the ages, but it looks like many of the observation 
chambers from this Region. Unlike the other locked 
doors leading north into Region F, the one in this 
room is trapped. If the PCs touch or in any way 
interact with the door short of placing the correct 
key in the door, hold monster is cast at 5th level (spell 
save DC 16) on the closest PC.
Encounter Condition: Hazardous Footing 10
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs spend 30 minutes sifting through 
the debris allow them a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to find a pair of dimensional shackles under 
some of the stones. The shackles radiate evil and 
have blood caked on them from centuries of use.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a glyph of warding (3rd level, explosive, necrotic). 
To decrease the challenge, replace the hold monster 
with chill touch (cast as if by a level 5).
B127 . DIRE WOLF DEN
The door to this room is broken off the hinges.
A large room extends into the darkness. You hear 
low growls erupting from what you can only 
assume are wolves or hounds. The room appears 
empty, but the smell of wet, dirty fur indicates 
something is living here.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: There are three dire wolves in this room 
and they do not take kindly to the intruders in their 
home. They are resting in the shadowy northern 
half of the room. They can see the PCs at the door-
way, and they wait until the first PC enters the room 
to attack. If they surprise the PCs, they gain a +2 to 
their initiative.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), 
Concealment
Tactics: The dire wolves fight as a pack, concentrat-
ing their attacks against one PC at a time. While 
one draws the attention of the PC, the other two 
flank them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one dire wolf. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.
B128 . HALLOWED GROUND
While the door to this room can be locked, it is 
presently unlocked. In order to lock it, the PCs must 
succeed at a DC 25 Sleight of Hand check.
Soothing energy fills this room. Being here 
lightens your heart and the aches and pains 
you’ve accumulated during your adventures wash 
away, becoming dull afterthoughts. The room is 
unadorned, but that only adds to the peaceful 
feeling washing over you. A single pedestal with a 
bowl on top of it rests against the back wall.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: There is a soothing calm to the room and 
the locals often rest here. This room is Safe, so long 
as the PCs lock the door behind them.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 10, Positive En-
ergy, [Safe]
Tactics: If the PCs lock the door behind them, they 
can safely rest here for 1d12 hours without interrup-
tion. After that, the GM should roll for a Random 
Encounter. If a trap is rolled, ignore it, and if a crea-
ture is rolled, it tries to open the door, picking the 
lock or pounding on it for entry. If this occurs, the 
room isn’t considered Safe again for 1d3 days.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A

B129. THE LAST STAND AGAINST THE FINAL OPTION
The door on the east wall is locked and barred. 
Opening it from the outside requires a DC 25 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check and a DC 20 
Strength (Athletics) check.
This room is small and empty, with three doors. 
Each leads deeper into the dungeon. The simple 
granite walls look untouched, and faint outlines 
of footprints layer the dust on the floor. A crack 
separates the two halves of the ceiling.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is equipped with a mighty 
swinging pendulum, one of the many traps the 
bugbears have designed to keep creatures from 
Region B from getting in. The trap is triggered 16 
seconds after any door is opened.
The trap’s reset mechanism is located to the west 
wall, under a loose stone. A DC 10 Sleight of Hand 
check is required to lift the stone gingerly enough 
not to trigger a chill touch spell (targeted at that 
creature, cast at level 5) protecting the reset plate. 
Disabling the reset mechanism prevents the trap 
from triggering for 1d3 days.
 '
Pendulum Trap. Once activated, creatures within a 
5 ft. line running the exact center of the room from 
end to end must succeed a Dexterity saving throw 
(DC 15) or take 5d8 damage. Creatures that save 
only receive half. This effect repeats every few sec-
onds, slowing down and dealing one less d8 until it 
comes to a stop at zero.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change the damage dealt by the pendulum to mag-
ical necrotic damage. To decrease the challenge, 
remove the chill touch trap.
B130. GOBLIN PILGRIMS
Allow the PCs Wisdom (Perception) checks to over-
hear the talking going on inside this room.
A ragtag group of goblins takes refuge in this 
expanded hall. Their chanting is unnatural 
sounding and highly disconcerting.
If the PCs succeed at a DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) 
check as they open the door, read the following.
They don’t seem to notice you as they are 
completely enraptured by the tokens and trinkets 
they’ve collected into a pile on the floor.
Otherwise, read the following.
Cackling and shrieking, they rise in unison. With 
one mind the goblins gather their weapons.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Six goblin warriors have made the long 
journey from the goblin empire to the shrine of 
their deity. They have collected about 20 gp worth of 
“junk” that they intend to offer to the goblin shrine 
(Room B134). Having traveled a great distance to 
get here and having fought off numerous creatures 
along the way, they are not about to back down 
from the “heathen” PCs. Seeing the PCs as defilers, 
the goblin pilgrims viciously assault the PCs, not 
offering them a chance to “talk.”
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4, Fearless
Tactics: If the goblins are not surprised, they attack 
the PCs in a massive swarm, concentrating their at-
tacks on whomever is closest. The goblins continue 
fighting even when an opponent falls. Zealous, they 
jump on and lash out at their victim continuously 
until there is nothing left. The largest of the goblins 
goes so far as to bite (action, guaranteed hit, 1d2 
points of damage), once an opponent is downed.
Treasure: There are about 5 lbs. of trinkets that collec-
tively equal about 20 gp in value.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add six goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove 
two goblins.

201
B131 HIDDEN PRISON
The door is locked and requires a DC 24 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check to open. It relocks automati-
cally, so the PCs must unlock and push it open in one 
swift motion, lest the door locks again immediately.
As you enter the room a chill runs down your back 
and your arms. The room, simple and bare, seems 
devoid of life. The smooth floor, the high ceiling, 
and the darkness make you feel like you’ve stepped 
into a tower belfry. An ominous moan fills the air, 
followed by a chill wind.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Before the PCs can think, flip a coin to 
see if their torches are blown out by the draft. After 
that check to see if the PCs are surprised by the four 
vargouilles’ descent upon them. The ceiling, over 
60 ft. high, hides the vargouilles from sight until 
they are ready to ambush the PCs, which happens as 
soon as one of them tampers with the lock. They are 
merciless and attack the PCs like shrieking bombers.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), 
Concealment, Desecration 4, Drafty, Extreme Cold, 
Negative Energy
Tactics: Immediately upon descending on the PCs, 
the first two vargouilles Shriek, and the next two 
(their initiative 2 lower), drop down to Kiss any PCs 
paralyzed with fear. The vargouilles continue attack-
ing with diving attacks, flying up and back around. 
Due to the darkness, ranged attacks fired up into 
the chamber suffer from concealment penalties.
They alternate between Kiss and Bite attacks, 
allowing their venom to slowly weaken PCs. Unlike 
the vargouilles in Room B114, these put up a fight.
Treasure: Should the PCs find adequate light, they 
can climb the walls of this room, to reach many of 
the shelves at the higher levels. Along the north wall 
at the 40 ft mark is a ledge 4 ft wide and 4 ft long. 
On the ledge is a small nest, with nothing in it. If 
the PC succeeds at a DC 20 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check, they find a cache in the north wall just 
above the ledge. The cache is trapped but hides a 
small strongbox.
Inside the strongbox—strapped down with silk 
ties—are six potions of healing and a ring of swim-
ming. In addition, the felt bottom of the strongbox 
is magical (faint abjuration), helping to protect 
potions and other items from shattering. If a saving 
throw is ever called for glass items stored inside 
this box, they gain advantage on that save.
Along the north wall at the 15 ft. mark is a ledge, 
4 ft. wide and 5 ft. long. It is sturdy and a perfect 
place from which to view the entire room. Offal on 
the ledge makes moving on it difficult, however 
(Hazardous Footing 14).
Along the south wall at the 40 ft. mark is a ledge, 
3 ft. wide and 4 ft. long. Along the south wall at the 
40 ft. mark is a ledge, 4 ft. wide and 2 ft. long. A 
Small or smaller creature can crouch on this ledge, 
allowing them a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check to find a loose stone in the wall, revealing 
a small cache with a small pile of gleaming bolts. 
There are five screaming bolts with continual flame 
cast on them. While not trapped, they are warm 
to the touch, which may or may not shock the PC. 
Screaming bolts frighten enemies within 15 ft, of 
them as they fly towards their target if they fail a 
DC 14 Wisdom save.
Along the east wall at the 35 ft. mark is a broken 
stone, 1 ft. wide and 2 ft. long. Along the east wall at 
the 45 ft. mark is a ledge, 2 ft. wide and 3 ft. long.
Along the west wall at the 25 ft. mark is a stone, 
2 ft. wide and 1 ft. long. Along the west wall at the 
50 ft. mark is a ledge, 4 ft. wide and 1 ft. long. It 
is nearly impossible to stand on. But tall PCs may 
use this ledge to reach a hidden shelf 6 ft. above 
the ledge. While it cannot be seen from here, it can 
be seen from the highest ledge on the north wall 
(DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check). The shelf is 3 ft. 
wide and 1 ft deep, being cut into the shape of the 
room. Resting on the shelf is a small urn, painted 
red and black and making it difficult to spot.
The urn is trapped with purple worm poison that 
has been smeared on the lid and a fire trap (Room 
B18) that ignites when the lid is removed. However, 
the urn weighs no more than 2 lbs. and easily fits in 
the PC’s pouch for the long climb back down.
Inside the urn are black ashes—actually ten 
doses of dust of disappearance that hide an amulet of 
barkskin (once per short rest cast of barkskin requir-
ing no material components). The GM should keep 
this hidden as long as possible. The amulet remains 
invisible until all the dust is used, but begins clang-
ing in the urn as the dust level drops.
The GM may allow PCs to leap from ledge to 
ledge, but the width of the room may prohibit this.
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add one vargouille. 
To decrease the challenge, remove one vargouille.

202
B132. THE WAY STATION
As the PCs near the entranceway to Room B132, read 
the following.
The sounds of a large group of creatures echoes 
from behind the door. Goblin-like grunts and barks 
intermingle with the yips of wolves. It sounds like 
the room is pretty active.
If the PCs enter Room B132 without making a 
Dexterity (Stealth) check, read the following.
All activities cease and the room falls silent as 
you open the door. Two dozen goblins and a few 
hobgoblins stare at you, their arms filled with 
barrels and crossbows. A group of worgs in the 
corner growl and tension mounts.
If the PCs enter Room B132 and succeed a Dexterity 
(Stealth) check, read the following.
Nearly a dozen goblins and a pair of hobgoblins 
move about the room, obviously setting up defenses 
of some kind. The goblins carry equipment that is 
too big for them and the hobgoblins yell over the 
sounds of the barking worgs.
The door to this room can be locked, but at present 
is unlocked. A successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) check unlocks it without a key.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The PCs have entered a secret hideout for 
the goblin king’s soldiers. Having moved defensive 
equipment in quietly over the past few weeks, the 
excited goblins and hobgoblins are now working 
louder than they should. A perfect place to mount 
an ambush, the PCs have stumbled upon the goblin 
king’s secret plans.
There are ten goblins warriors, two hobgoblin 
guards, and three worgs in this room. The goblins 
are armed with shortswords and light crossbows, 
much different from those who trained with Ham-
merfist. The hobgoblins wear scale mail and carry 
masterwork shortbows and arrows. The worgs wear 
studded leather barding.
If the PCs have not made an alliance with the 
goblin king, Argliss, then they have a fight on 
their hands. Even if they have, the hobgoblins are 
Unfriendly, not wanting the PCs to know their 
business. A single spark is all that is needed for this 
powder keg of tension to erupt in combat.
If the PCs have allied themselves with the goblin 
king, the initial attitude of the goblins in this room 
is Indifferent. The goblins return to their business 
and ignore the PCs.
If the PCs attempt to speak with the goblins, 
they are met with short, gruff answers. As long as 
the PCs do not insult the goblins’ god, they will not 
attack the PCs.
The hobgoblins provide information regard-
ing bugbear attacks and the wild monsters in the 
region but are also gruff and barely tolerate the 
PCs. The worgs are only being held back by their 
hobgoblin handlers, and constantly growl and snap 
at the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: These goblins are zealots. They have under-
taken a long and tough (for them) pilgrimage to 
their god’s shrine. They attack the PCs in a massive 
swarm, concentrating their attacks on whoever is 
closest. The goblins will not stop attacking even 
when they are down. They jump on and gnash at 
their victim continuously until there is nothing left.
The hobgoblins fight with better tactics. They 
are armed not with short swords, but with short 
bows. The hobgoblins let the worgs loose on the 
first round of combat. The worgs dive into the PCs, 
striking randomly. The hobgoblins stay in the back 
corner of the room and unleash volleys of arrows at 
whoever they perceive to be the most powerful PCs. 
Once the target is down they concentrate their fire 
on the next most powerful, and so on.
Treasure: The barrels contain stones, whetstones, oil, 
and enough arrows, bolts, and javelins to last two 
campaigns. If the PCs need to refill their ammu-
nition, now is the time. A small pony keg contains 
ale, apparently smuggled in and a small strongbox 
(DC 24 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open) 
contains six vials of acid, six vials of alchemical fire, 
six vials of oil, and four tindertwigs.
The lead hobgoblin carries the key to the door.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add four goblins and one hobgoblin. To de-
crease the challenge, remove four goblins and one 
hobgoblin.

B133-B136 . THE SHRINE TO 
NORENDITHAS STONESHAPER  
THE QUICKTHINKING, SMITER OF FOES
What was once the final resting place of a wayward 
goblin hunter who ran afoul of a cockatrice, has 
become the true mecca for the goblin culture. The re-
moteness of their empire coupled with a location that 
is virtually on the other side of the maze, heightens 
the importance of this place; only those truly devoted 
to Norendithas Stoneshaper dare to make the trek.
The shrine is hidden behind a secret door. That a 
simple goblin passed through the door in the first 
place is astonishing, that another group of goblins 
followed the first perfectly is a true miracle. When Ar-
gliss first visited the would-be shrine, he was able to 
understand the nature of the door and gave the gob-
lin keepers of the shrine specific instructions on how 
to open and close it. It wouldn’t do if the keepers and 
so-called priests could not locate their own shrine.
The shrine is well guarded by Argliss’ elite hob-
goblins. The goblin god is the source of the doppel-
ganger’s power over the goblins, and he will not allow 
anything to jeopardize it. At any given time, the PCs 
may encounter one of the heavily armed patrols. By 
now, they should be used to the tactics of the goblins, 
and it is possible they have allied themselves with Ar-
gliss and are permitted to pay homage at the shrine.
If the PCs have allied themselves with the rebel 
goblins, the devout guards and keepers swarm the 
PCs until they are driven back or dead. The goblins do 
not tolerate heathens in their most holy of places.
B133. THE ANTECHAMBER
As the PCs near the secret door on the north wall 
read the following.
A section of the wall has been turned inward. It is 
quite obvious looking at it now that it was meant 
as a secret passage into the room beyond. Someone, 
however, has left it open. You hear strange chanting 
coming from inside the room. The high-pitched  
near wails grate on your ears as you enter.
When the PCs enter Room B133, read the following.
The goblins have hung impressive, but crude, 
tapestries along the walls. Each depicts a ferocious-
looking goblin, scowling with its hands raised above 
its head. A few goblins kneel in supplication before a 
heavy stone door set into the southern wall.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: If the PCs quietly enter the room, the 
goblins and hobgoblins do not notice them, as they 
are too involved in prayer.
Regardless of whether the PCs have made an 
alliance with the goblin king, the PCs are not wel-
come here. Three goblin warriors, unarmed, do not 
pose a threat in and of themselves, but 6d6 seconds 
after the PCs enter this room, the Hobgoblin Holy 
Guard of Stoneshaper—made up of four hobgob-
lins wielding masterwork longswords—arrive to 
drive them off.
Encounter Condition: Fearless, Hallowed 2
Tactics: If the PCs are known by the goblin empire 
as allies, they merely guide them out of the room, 
rather forcefully, but as diplomatically as possi-
ble. The goblins yell obscenities as the PCs are 
escorted out.
If the PCs are enemies of the goblins, the 
hobgoblins are outright aggressive and the goblin 
zealots grab anything they can find to use as weap-
ons. The goblins lash out, almost hysterical, while 
the hobgoblins concentrate on the PCs’ front rank, 
using brute strength to push the PCs out of the 
room, fighting them in the hall, if possible.
Treasure: The goblins consider the tapestries of their 
god priceless, though they hold no value outside 
this room. The rebel goblins might be interested 
in taking them, however, so they can defile their 
enemies’ religious icons.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two hobgoblins. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one goblin.

204
B134. THE STATUE OF NORENDITHAS STONESHAPER  
THE QUICKTHINKING, SMITER OF FOES
The room is dominated by religious iconography; 
sigils and prayer beads adorn the room. Regardless 
of what the room was originally designed for, 
the faith of the goblins has transformed it into 
something more than it was.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: PCs curious about the statue can inspect 
it. A DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check or a DC 20 
Wisdom (Survival) check reveals the statue is a 
goblin turned to stone. A second check reveals that 
either a basilisk, cockatrice, or medusa could have 
done this. PCs succeeding at a third check know 
that a medusa would leave the statue here to mark 
the boundary of its lair.
Every five minutes the PCs remain in this room, 
roll a Random Encounter, with a roll of 1-15 be-
ing Nothing and a roll of 19-20 is the Hobgoblin 
Holy Guard from Room B133 coming to secure the 
room. A 16, 17, or 18 occurs per this Section's table.
Encounter Condition: Fearless, Hallowed 5
Tactics: Hobgoblins that enter the room, do not 
hesitate and swarm the PCs. They flank the PCs in 
an attempt to subdue them and take them prisoner. 
Goblins are shaken (-1 to all rolls) for 3 turns upon 
seeing the PCs in their sacred hall.
This room contains a hidden door to Region C. 
A DC 25 Investigation check is required to locate 
the door. A special catch must be released to open 
the secret door (that slides upwards). A DC 15 Dex-
terity (Sleight of Hand) check allows the PC to slide 
their fingers into the slender crevice and open the 
secret door.
A second secret door lies beyond the first, 
requiring the same checks to find and open it. The 
secret doors close on their own after 1 minute.
Neither the goblins nor hobgoblins have located 
these doors and were unaware of a passage into 
Region C from this location. If the PCs move on 
to Region C without dealing with the holy goblin 
empire, Argliss learns of the secret door in 2d6 days 
and sends patrols into Region C, looking for a new 
route to the gnolls. 2d6 days after that, they learn of 
the cockatrice and the fate of their “god.”
Treasure: The offerings the goblins have left behind 
for their deity are in special bowls at the base of the 
statue. Burnt offerings, copper coins, and trinkets 
worthless to the PCs fill the bowls. Collectively the 
contents of the room are worth about 6 gp.

1A sharp wind blows through the Section, its source unidentifiable but strong and persistent. Drafty.

A single, sickly feather lies in the middle of the hallway (it’s from a cockatrice, though the PCs may not 
know this initially).
3A shrill cackle echoes through the halls, followed by the cooing of a giant bird. Echoes 4.
4-15Nothing.

A goblin dressed in ill-fitting leather robes roams the halls. It is one of the keepers of the shrine, his 
head is bent in prayer. He carries a staff carved in incomprehensible runes. Due to his praying, he 
suffers disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.
17
Twelve goblin pilgrims march towards the shrine. Their attitude is Hostile, as they drive the PCs from 
the Section.
18
Two hobgoblins, mounted on worgs, and 2d6 goblins patrol the section, safeguarding pilgrims on 
their journey. Their attitude is Unfriendly, and they order the PCs to leave the area. At the slightest 
provocation, their attitude becomes Hostile and they attack.
19A fire trap (B18) is set in the passageway.

Bartleby searches the Section for his elusive artifact. He is easily agitated and reveals that he believes 
the artifact must be in the shrine, as it is the only Section he has yet to fully explore.

B135 . THE KEEPER'S  
CLOISTER
As you enter the room you see an ornately dressed 
goblin cowering in the corner. He is wielding a 
small dagger in a shaky fist. The goblin hisses and 
sputters curses at you, spittle flying off its lips. It 
makes no move to advance or attack you, however.
The room is decorated in the same imagery as the 
antechamber and is finished simply. A small desk, 
covered in deep red stains, stands against the 
western wall. Against the southern wall is a simple 
cot, covered in rags.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The PCs have entered the personal 
quarters of the Keeper of the Shrine (5 hp goblin 
warrior). The keeper is a devout goblin, but not very 
brave. As long as the PCs do not attack him, the 
Keeper does not attack them. He curses in Goblin, 
gesturing in a vulgar manner that the PCs must 
leave the shrine. He does not speak Common.
The Hobgoblin Holy Guard (Rooms B134 and 
B136) does not enter the room unless they hear the 
sounds of combat. They have been trained not to 
disturb the Keeper’s meditation.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 1
Tactics: While he babbles he casts sanctuary to defend 
himself. If attacked the Keeper lunges at the closest 
PC. He knows he does not stand a chance against 
the PCs, but he cannot dishonor himself further 
by fleeing.
If the hobgoblins come to his rescue, they attack 
the PCs and attempt to break them off into two 
groups. They pin spellcasters and clerics into cor-
ners and fight fervently for their religious beliefs. 
If the Keeper is killed, they fight as though always 
enraged (see barbarian Rage class feature, their 
level is equal to their challenge rating).

B136 . BARRACKS OF  
THE HOLY GUARD
These cramped quarters house four hobgoblin 
guards who sit on the floor or on the bunks, their 
weapons at their sides. The bunks are stacked 
four high and the room reeks of sweat. Along the 
southern wall is a weapons rack, now empty.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The barracks of the Hobgoblin Holy 
Guard of the Stoneshaper is just as volatile a room 
as any located in the confines of the shrine. With 
most of the guardsmen patrolling, hobgoblin 
guards in this room do not pose a huge threat to 
the PCs. The guardsmen are relentless in their at-
tacks however hopeless their situation may seem.
Encounter Condition: Fearless
Tactics: Like the other hobgoblin patrol and guard 
units, these hobgoblins single out the most pow-
erful PC and attack them en masse. They flank the 
PCs as often as possible, moving on to the next PC 
as soon as one is down. They take PC captives to the 
goblin king unless they are known enemies of the 
holy empire, in which case they are put to death.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one hobgoblin. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one.
