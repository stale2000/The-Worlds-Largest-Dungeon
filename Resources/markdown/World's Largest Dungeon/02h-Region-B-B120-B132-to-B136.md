# Region B (continued)

## B120-B132. RUINS

The fallout from the earthquake can still be felt here. Doors are broken open from the inside. Unholy screams fill the corridors. And everywhere the PCs go, the smell of death follows them. This place is unfit for the living... let alone the dead.

Unlike the majority of the Region, this expanse suffered real damage. The halls are strewn with rubble and debris that make traversing them an adventure in and of itself. Doors are broken from the inside, hanging on their hinges, allowing a glimpse into the shadowy confines of the rooms beyond. On top of all the damage, there is still the matter of the inhabitants wandering the halls.

The goblins and bugbears may have control over their respective sections, but this section is ruled by wild creatures and untamed monsters. This makes pilgrimages to the shrine that much more difficult as beasts threaten the goblins at every turn. This Section is not safe.

To add to the disturbing nature of the Section, the stench of death and decay permeates the very air. The creatures here do not coexist peacefully and between their encounters with each other and the goblins that enter this area surreptitiously. The results of various conflicts have saturated the dungeon. Dark stains, scattered bones, and broken weapons mark the violence of these meetings. Compared to the relatively spartan and benign rooms in the other areas, this entire section radiates a dangerous aura.

The GM should add the following Encounter Conditions as he sees fit: Echoes 4, Poor Footing 4, and Stagnant Air.

Every room's door is either open or broken off.

### Random Encounters

Roll for a Random Encounter once per hour.

| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | The humid air and warm temperature combine to generate a thick, murky mist. Fog 5 or 10. |
| 2 | Something cursed this room. A vengeful spirit, a goblin mystic, or maybe even a powerful wizard is responsible. Negative Energy. |
| 3 | The chittering sound of the dungeon's inhabitants echoes wildly off the walls here. The various growls and howls coalesce in this room, rattling all those in it to the core of their being. Distracting Noises. |
| 4 | The earthquake damaged the floor significantly here, and the sharp rubble presents a dangerous obstacle. Hazardous Footing 15. |
| 5 | A dead body, now unidentifiable, lies across the PCs' path. Maggots and flies surround it and the air is choked with the smell of rot. Stagnant Air. |
| 6-12 | Nothing. |
| 13-15 | A creature sticks its head out of a doorway, sees the PCs then disappears again before they reach it. |
| 16 | A hail of needles trap (Room B35) silently blocks the path forward. Instead of a pedestal, multiple stones on the floor act as hidden triggers. A DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to spot the irregularity. |
| 17 | A spiked pit trap (Room B1) lies in wait. Circumventing it would take 30 minutes. |
| 18 | A camouflage pit (Room B40) is in the way. Circumventing it would take 30 minutes. |
| 19 | A spiked pit trap (Room B1) lies in wait. Circumventing it would take 30 minutes. Use the increased difficulty version. |
| 20 | Bartleby searches the area around the shrine for his elusive artifact. He is easily agitated and believes the artifact ought to be in the shrine, as it is the only area he has yet to fully explore. |

### B120. THE CROSSROADS

The enormity of this room astounds you. Its sheer, white walls and bleached granite ceiling are truly impressive. Less impressive are the red scrawled runes carved and painted on the walls. The writing is hard to decipher, but it appears to be a series of taunts and proclamations from one group to the other. The center of the room is likewise stained. Upon closer inspection, it appears to be blood.

In addition to the room's decor, there is an unmistakable smell of rot. While the smell isn't overpowering, it isn't comfortable either.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Bugbears use this room to lure their enemies into a series of traps, all simple but effective. Typically, the bugbears run through the room, and exit through any one of a number of doors, pressing hidden triggers as they go. In actuality, this trick has worked nearly a dozen times, and each time the bugbears reset the traps, they prepare for another wave of gullible victims.

Pressure-sensitive plates underneath the floor trigger the first trap, which in turn triggers two more. PCs stepping across the floor require a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to avoid triggering the first hail of needles trap. PCs that are moving quickly suffer disadvantage on this check.

After the hail of needles trap (Room B35), a poison dust trap (Room B118) goes off, followed by a spiked pit trap (Room B1) in the floor (with a 6-second gap between each trap). To make matters worse, the pit is lined with spikes. Presently three dead goblins line the bottom of the pit, all of which are decomposing and covered in maggots.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** To safely cross the room the PCs need to locate the reset mechanism, which is located beneath a chipped tile in the northwestern corner of the room. There are three separate triggers, each to a different trap. A fourth trigger leads to the delay between the traps, allowing the PCs the opportunity to alter the intervals between the traps from 1 round to 6 rounds. This requires a DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

There is a 10% chance that two bugbears are in this room resetting and rearming the traps. If so, they are Unfriendly to the PCs, having never seen humans (etc.) before.

**Treasure:** Tucked in the southwest corner are two dead goblins, maybe 2 or 3 days old. They are covered in needles and their clothing is torn to shreds. The PCs require a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) or DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find these bodies. They have 1d4 sp each in their mauled pockets, but the bugbears have stripped everything else away.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a fire trap (Room B18) that goes off at the bottom of the pit. To decrease the challenge, remove the fungal dust vapor trap.

---

### B121. BUGBEAR BIVOUAC

This small room has been taken over by a group of bugbears. They bark and growl at you as you enter, tightening their grip on their clubs. The bugbears seem wary and tired, waiting for you to make the first move.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** Three bugbear soldiers use this location to harass the goblin pilgrims traveling to the shrine (Room B134). Any disruption of the goblin king's minions is seen as a victory to the bugbears and they take full advantage of the long trip many goblins make to visit their deity.

If the PCs can convince the bugbears they are friends, their attitude shifts to Indifferent and they allow the PCs to make use of the room to rest. If the bugbears believe the PCs are allied with either faction of goblins, their attitude instantly becomes Hostile and they attack the PCs.

**Encounter Condition:** [Safe]

**Tactics:** The bugbears know they are outmatched, and avoid a fight if possible. They gang up on the nearest PC and use them as a human shield if possible. They stay close together, making sure they cannot be flanked, engaging the PCs en masse only when safe, and taking down opponents as quickly as possible—they know the cost of a protracted fight.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one bugbear and change their initial attitude to Hostile. To decrease the challenge, have the bugbears out on patrol, only to return in 1d6 minutes.

---

### B122. WAYWARD AND LOST

Have the effects of this room carry out 30 ft. or so from the room, causing the PCs to become confused before they reach the interior. The doors to this room are broken or missing.

All around you, the walls and floor dance with wavy heat lines, moving from you. Your vision blurs and the boundaries of the room grow more confusing, shifting in front of you. Suddenly your ears begin to ring and your balance is disrupted. On the ground, dead bodies of goblins and wolves twist and writhe. Their heads move as though barking, but no sound comes out.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Whatever magic created in this room has become tainted, twisting the PC's minds and feeding them hallucinations. This takes effect every 1d4 minutes (per PC) and the effects are cumulative (frightened becomes restrained, restrained becomes paralyzed), so spending long in this room can be dangerous for the PC's well-being.

**Encounter Condition:** Deep Silence, Fear 15

**Tactics:** PCs remaining in the room suffer the effects of *confusion* (no save) until they leave. The GM is encouraged to make the room difficult to escape.

**Treasure:** The goblins each carry 1d3 mundane items and there is one minor magic item under the body of the dire wolf, but the PCs are lucky to escape this room, let alone find time to search the dead.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

### B123. PIT OF DESPAIR

A deep pit takes up the center of this room. The walls have been broken from the weight of extreme stress, and gears and other mechanical devices are exposed. Obviously, a trap of some sort was the centerpiece of this room at one point, but it appears to be inoperable now. Still, for a room that seems relatively safe, why do you feel so unnerved?

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Once a great celestial trap filled this room, now the innards of the trap lay exposed. It was either damaged by the great earthquake or ruined by the bugbears; it is impossible to be sure.

There is a presence in the room, be it a creature that fell to the trap while it was still active, or something living at the bottom of the pit, and it is quite unnerving. The longer the PCs stay in this room, the more unnerved they become.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises, Distracting Visions, Echoes, Fear 15, Haunted

**Tactics:** For every hour the PCs spend in this room, they must make another fear save, increasing the DC by +1 for every previous check.

**Treasure:** A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a series of claw marks in the stone that could only come from the acidic touch of a demon or other creature. The stone is still hot from whatever made the marks. The marks radiate evil and strong transmutation. If the PCs spend 30 minutes collecting the molten pieces of stone from the wall, they can use them as special material components for 1d3 castings. Usable for any spell with a duration or range, the stones, touched by great evil, taint the magic with evil energy, doubling the duration and range of the spell. A DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the molten stone (once chipped away) can aid their castings of spells.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

### B124. CRYPT OF THE HOBGOBLIN KINGS

The door on the northeastern wall is open.

This room is filled with rubble and debris. Most of it appears to have been a part of a large statue at some point. The details have been destroyed, but from what you can tell it looks like the statue was of a fearsome celestial. A haze of smoke fills the ceiling, giving the impression that something (or someone) was burned here recently. A slag of cloth and flesh rests against the north wall, just below the broken statue.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room served as a burial place for various creatures in the Section. The statue, thought of as a guardian, or watcher of the dead, was offered burnt remains or whatever religious items of significance could be procured by visitors. Various races have used this room over the years and presently, the bugbears use it to burn their dead.

Even though the statue has crumbled with age and as a result of neglect, the creatures in the Section treat it with reverence. From time to time, whatever they can find is offered and laid to rest at its base. Usually, these coins and trinkets are taken by foolish or greedy goblins, but from time to time a small pile of silver can be found here.

**Encounter Condition:** Hazardous Footing 5, Positive Energy

**Tactics:** Sifting through the debris should take some time. A Random Encounter every 45 minutes or so is a good way to convince the PCs not to "hang around" too long.

**Treasure:** In the northwest corner of the room, under a large stone, is a hidden compartment, cut out from the floor. The compartment is about the size of a small coffin and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 18) to locate. The compartment has become a repository for discarded items. Various tremors in the room have buried it, however, and no one has "donated" to the compartment in years. A few discarded weapons and trinkets can be found as well as a **+1 steel shield**, and three **potions of giant strength**. If the GM likes, add a few hundred silver pieces as well.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add the Encounter Condition: Smoke. To decrease the challenge, remove the Hazardous Footing 5 Encounter Condition.

---

### B125. FIGHT FOR DOMINANCE

The north and south doors to this room are open.

As the PCs approach, allow them Wisdom (Perception) checks to hear the fighting, growling, and baying taking place in this room. Otherwise, they only hear the animals after they open one of the doors.

Three yellow-brown hounds are fighting against a pair of large, feral wolves. They snarl and bark at one another, neither giving in nor backing down. The fighting is quick and brutal.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** If the PCs remain still, the three blink dogs and two dire wolves continue fighting (although allow Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the PCs). If the fight continues, both groups bite and attack one another until they are at 50% hit points at which point they flee north (dire wolves) and south (blink dogs). The wolves wear collars, indicating that someone possibly "owns" them.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the PCs are noticed, both groups turn their attention and attack, splitting their energies between the PCs and their four-legged enemies. The GM should "mix it up" and make this melee as chaotic as it sounds.

The blink dogs here, while neutral good, are in a state of fury and not willing to explore whether the PCs are "good" or not. Consider these animals enraged (per the barbarian's rage class feature). Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks are made at disadvantage.

**Treasure:** The wolves wear nice leather collars, but nothing else of value is in this room. Heavy traffic keeps it clear of debris.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one dire wolf and two blink dogs. To decrease the challenge, remove one dire wolf.

---

### B126. CELESTIAL OBSERVATORY

The northern door to this room is locked and cannot be opened without the key in Room C105.

This room is a mess of rubble and cracked stone. After careful examination you can make out the remains of a stone desk and chair along one side of the room. Towards the back of the room are the broken pieces of what could only be a bookcase or shelf.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The purpose of this room has been lost to the ages, but it looks like many of the observation chambers from this Region. Unlike the other locked doors leading north into Region F, the one in this room is trapped. If the PCs touch or in any way interact with the door short of placing the correct key in the door, *hold monster* is cast at 5th level (spell save DC 16) on the closest PC.

**Encounter Condition:** Hazardous Footing 10

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** If the PCs spend 30 minutes sifting through the debris allow them a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find a pair of **dimensional shackles** under some of the stones. The shackles radiate evil and have blood caked on them from centuries of use.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a *glyph of warding* (3rd level, explosive, necrotic). To decrease the challenge, replace the *hold monster* with *chill touch* (cast as if by a level 5).

---

### B127. DIRE WOLF DEN

The door to this room is broken off the hinges.

A large room extends into the darkness. You hear low growls erupting from what you can only assume are wolves or hounds. The room appears empty, but the smell of wet, dirty fur indicates something is living here.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** There are three dire wolves in this room and they do not take kindly to the intruders in their home. They are resting in the shadowy northern half of the room. They can see the PCs at the doorway, and they wait until the first PC enters the room to attack. If they surprise the PCs, they gain a +2 to their initiative.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), Concealment

**Tactics:** The dire wolves fight as a pack, concentrating their attacks against one PC at a time. While one draws the attention of the PC, the other two flank them.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one dire wolf. To decrease the challenge, remove one.

---

### B128. HALLOWED GROUND

While the door to this room can be locked, it is presently unlocked. In order to lock it, the PCs must succeed at a DC 25 Sleight of Hand check.

Soothing energy fills this room. Being here lightens your heart and the aches and pains you've accumulated during your adventures wash away, becoming dull afterthoughts. The room is unadorned, but that only adds to the peaceful feeling washing over you. A single pedestal with a bowl on top of it rests against the back wall.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** There is a soothing calm to the room and the locals often rest here. This room is Safe, so long as the PCs lock the door behind them.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 10, Positive Energy, [Safe]

**Tactics:** If the PCs lock the door behind them, they can safely rest here for 1d12 hours without interruption. After that, the GM should roll for a Random Encounter. If a trap is rolled, ignore it, and if a creature is rolled, it tries to open the door, picking the lock or pounding on it for entry. If this occurs, the room isn't considered Safe again for 1d3 days.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

### B129. THE LAST STAND AGAINST THE FINAL OPTION

The door on the east wall is locked and barred. Opening it from the outside requires a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check and a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.

This room is small and empty, with three doors. Each leads deeper into the dungeon. The simple granite walls look untouched, and faint outlines of footprints layer the dust on the floor. A crack separates the two halves of the ceiling.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is equipped with a mighty swinging pendulum, one of the many traps the bugbears have designed to keep creatures from Region B from getting in. The trap is triggered 16 seconds after any door is opened.

The trap's reset mechanism is located to the west wall, under a loose stone. A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check is required to lift the stone gingerly enough not to trigger a *chill touch* spell (targeted at that creature, cast at level 5) protecting the reset plate. Disabling the reset mechanism prevents the trap from triggering for 1d3 days.

**Pendulum Trap.** Once activated, creatures within a 5 ft. line running the exact center of the room from end to end must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or take 5d8 damage. Creatures that save only receive half. This effect repeats every few seconds, slowing down and dealing one less d8 until it comes to a stop at zero.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, change the damage dealt by the pendulum to magical necrotic damage. To decrease the challenge, remove the *chill touch* trap.

---

### B130. GOBLIN PILGRIMS

Allow the PCs Wisdom (Perception) checks to overhear the talking going on inside this room.

A ragtag group of goblins takes refuge in this expanded hall. Their chanting is unnatural sounding and highly disconcerting.

If the PCs succeed at a DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) check as they open the door, read the following.

They don't seem to notice you as they are completely enraptured by the tokens and trinkets they've collected into a pile on the floor.

Otherwise, read the following.

Cackling and shrieking, they rise in unison. With one mind the goblins gather their weapons.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Six goblin warriors have made the long journey from the goblin empire to the shrine of their deity. They have collected about 20 gp worth of "junk" that they intend to offer to the goblin shrine (Room B134). Having traveled a great distance to get here and having fought off numerous creatures along the way, they are not about to back down from the "heathen" PCs. Seeing the PCs as defilers, the goblin pilgrims viciously assault the PCs, not offering them a chance to "talk."

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 4, Fearless

**Tactics:** If the goblins are not surprised, they attack the PCs in a massive swarm, concentrating their attacks on whomever is closest. The goblins continue fighting even when an opponent falls. Zealous, they jump on and lash out at their victim continuously until there is nothing left. The largest of the goblins goes so far as to bite (action, guaranteed hit, 1d2 points of damage), once an opponent is downed.

**Treasure:** There are about 5 lbs. of trinkets that collectively equal about 20 gp in value.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add six goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove two goblins.

---

### B131. HIDDEN PRISON

The door is locked and requires a DC 24 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open. It relocks automatically, so the PCs must unlock and push it open in one swift motion, lest the door locks again immediately.

As you enter the room a chill runs down your back and your arms. The room, simple and bare, seems devoid of life. The smooth floor, the high ceiling, and the darkness make you feel like you've stepped into a tower belfry. An ominous moan fills the air, followed by a chill wind.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Before the PCs can think, flip a coin to see if their torches are blown out by the draft. After that check to see if the PCs are surprised by the four vargouilles' descent upon them. The ceiling, over 60 ft. high, hides the vargouilles from sight until they are ready to ambush the PCs, which happens as soon as one of them tampers with the lock. They are merciless and attack the PCs like shrieking bombers.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), Concealment, Desecration 4, Drafty, Extreme Cold, Negative Energy

**Tactics:** Immediately upon descending on the PCs, the first two vargouilles Shriek, and the next two (their initiative 2 lower), drop down to Kiss any PCs paralyzed with fear. The vargouilles continue attacking with diving attacks, flying up and back around. Due to the darkness, ranged attacks fired up into the chamber suffer from concealment penalties.

They alternate between Kiss and Bite attacks, allowing their venom to slowly weaken PCs. Unlike the vargouilles in Room B114, these put up a fight.

**Treasure:** Should the PCs find adequate light, they can climb the walls of this room, to reach many of the shelves at the higher levels. Along the north wall at the 40 ft mark is a ledge 4 ft wide and 4 ft long. On the ledge is a small nest, with nothing in it. If the PC succeeds at a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check, they find a cache in the north wall just above the ledge. The cache is trapped but hides a small strongbox.

Inside the strongbox—strapped down with silk ties—are six **potions of healing** and a **ring of swimming**. In addition, the felt bottom of the strongbox is magical (faint abjuration), helping to protect potions and other items from shattering. If a saving throw is ever called for glass items stored inside this box, they gain advantage on that save.

Along the north wall at the 15 ft. mark is a ledge, 4 ft. wide and 5 ft. long. It is sturdy and a perfect place from which to view the entire room. Offal on the ledge makes moving on it difficult, however (Hazardous Footing 14).

Along the south wall at the 40 ft. mark is a ledge, 3 ft. wide and 4 ft. long. Along the south wall at the 40 ft. mark is a ledge, 4 ft. wide and 2 ft. long. A Small or smaller creature can crouch on this ledge, allowing them a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find a loose stone in the wall, revealing a small cache with a small pile of gleaming bolts. There are five **screaming bolts** with *continual flame* cast on them. While not trapped, they are warm to the touch, which may or may not shock the PC. Screaming bolts frighten enemies within 15 ft, of them as they fly towards their target if they fail a DC 14 Wisdom save.

Along the east wall at the 35 ft. mark is a broken stone, 1 ft. wide and 2 ft. long. Along the east wall at the 45 ft. mark is a ledge, 2 ft. wide and 3 ft. long.

Along the west wall at the 25 ft. mark is a stone, 2 ft. wide and 1 ft. long. Along the west wall at the 50 ft. mark is a ledge, 4 ft. wide and 1 ft. long. It is nearly impossible to stand on. But tall PCs may use this ledge to reach a hidden shelf 6 ft. above the ledge. While it cannot be seen from here, it can be seen from the highest ledge on the north wall (DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check). The shelf is 3 ft. wide and 1 ft deep, being cut into the shape of the room. Resting on the shelf is a small urn, painted red and black and making it difficult to spot.

The urn is trapped with purple worm poison that has been smeared on the lid and a fire trap (Room B18) that ignites when the lid is removed. However, the urn weighs no more than 2 lbs. and easily fits in the PC's pouch for the long climb back down.

Inside the urn are black ashes—actually ten doses of **dust of disappearance** that hide an **amulet of barkskin** (once per short rest cast of *barkskin* requiring no material components). The GM should keep this hidden as long as possible. The amulet remains invisible until all the dust is used, but begins clanging in the urn as the dust level drops.

The GM may allow PCs to leap from ledge to ledge, but the width of the room may prohibit this.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, add one vargouille. To decrease the challenge, remove one vargouille.

---

### B132. THE WAY STATION

As the PCs near the entranceway to Room B132, read the following.

The sounds of a large group of creatures echoes from behind the door. Goblin-like grunts and barks intermingle with the yips of wolves. It sounds like the room is pretty active.

If the PCs enter Room B132 without making a Dexterity (Stealth) check, read the following.

All activities cease and the room falls silent as you open the door. Two dozen goblins and a few hobgoblins stare at you, their arms filled with barrels and crossbows. A group of worgs in the corner growl and tension mounts.

If the PCs enter Room B132 and succeed a Dexterity (Stealth) check, read the following.

Nearly a dozen goblins and a pair of hobgoblins move about the room, obviously setting up defenses of some kind. The goblins carry equipment that is too big for them and the hobgoblins yell over the sounds of the barking worgs.

The door to this room can be locked, but at present is unlocked. A successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check unlocks it without a key.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** The PCs have entered a secret hideout for the goblin king's soldiers. Having moved defensive equipment in quietly over the past few weeks, the excited goblins and hobgoblins are now working louder than they should. A perfect place to mount an ambush, the PCs have stumbled upon the goblin king's secret plans.

There are ten goblins warriors, two hobgoblin guards, and three worgs in this room. The goblins are armed with shortswords and light crossbows, much different from those who trained with Hammerfist. The hobgoblins wear scale mail and carry masterwork shortbows and arrows. The worgs wear studded leather barding.

If the PCs have not made an alliance with the goblin king, Argliss, then they have a fight on their hands. Even if they have, the hobgoblins are Unfriendly, not wanting the PCs to know their business. A single spark is all that is needed for this powder keg of tension to erupt in combat.

If the PCs have allied themselves with the goblin king, the initial attitude of the goblins in this room is Indifferent. The goblins return to their business and ignore the PCs.

If the PCs attempt to speak with the goblins, they are met with short, gruff answers. As long as the PCs do not insult the goblins' god, they will not attack the PCs.

The hobgoblins provide information regarding bugbear attacks and the wild monsters in the region but are also gruff and barely tolerate the PCs. The worgs are only being held back by their hobgoblin handlers, and constantly growl and snap at the PCs.

**Encounter Condition:** Fearless

**Tactics:** These goblins are zealots. They have undertaken a long and tough (for them) pilgrimage to their god's shrine. They attack the PCs in a massive swarm, concentrating their attacks on whoever is closest. The goblins will not stop attacking even when they are down. They jump on and gnash at their victim continuously until there is nothing left.

The hobgoblins fight with better tactics. They are armed not with short swords, but with short bows. The hobgoblins let the worgs loose on the first round of combat. The worgs dive into the PCs, striking randomly. The hobgoblins stay in the back corner of the room and unleash volleys of arrows at whoever they perceive to be the most powerful PCs. Once the target is down they concentrate their fire on the next most powerful, and so on.

**Treasure:** The barrels contain stones, whetstones, oil, and enough arrows, bolts, and javelins to last two campaigns. If the PCs need to refill their ammunition, now is the time. A small pony keg contains ale, apparently smuggled in and a small strongbox (DC 24 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open) contains six vials of acid, six vials of alchemical fire, six vials of oil, and four tindertwigs.

The lead hobgoblin carries the key to the door.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add four goblins and one hobgoblin. To decrease the challenge, remove four goblins and one hobgoblin.

## B133-B136. THE SHRINE TO NORENDITHAS STONESHAPER THE QUICKTHINKING, SMITER OF FOES

What was once the final resting place of a wayward goblin hunter who ran afoul of a cockatrice, has become the true mecca for the goblin culture. The remoteness of their empire coupled with a location that is virtually on the other side of the maze, heightens the importance of this place; only those truly devoted to Norendithas Stoneshaper dare to make the trek.

The shrine is hidden behind a secret door. That a simple goblin passed through the door in the first place is astonishing, that another group of goblins followed the first perfectly is a true miracle. When Argliss first visited the would-be shrine, he was able to understand the nature of the door and gave the goblin keepers of the shrine specific instructions on how to open and close it. It wouldn't do if the keepers and so-called priests could not locate their own shrine.

The shrine is well guarded by Argliss' elite hobgoblins. The goblin god is the source of the doppelganger's power over the goblins, and he will not allow anything to jeopardize it. At any given time, the PCs may encounter one of the heavily armed patrols. By now, they should be used to the tactics of the goblins, and it is possible they have allied themselves with Argliss and are permitted to pay homage at the shrine.

If the PCs have allied themselves with the rebel goblins, the devout guards and keepers swarm the PCs until they are driven back or dead. The goblins do not tolerate heathens in their most holy of places.

### B133. THE ANTECHAMBER

As the PCs near the secret door on the north wall read the following.

A section of the wall has been turned inward. It is quite obvious looking at it now that it was meant as a secret passage into the room beyond. Someone, however, has left it open. You hear strange chanting coming from inside the room. The high-pitched near wails grate on your ears as you enter.

When the PCs enter Room B133, read the following.

The goblins have hung impressive, but crude, tapestries along the walls. Each depicts a ferocious-looking goblin, scowling with its hands raised above its head. A few goblins kneel in supplication before a heavy stone door set into the southern wall.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** If the PCs quietly enter the room, the goblins and hobgoblins do not notice them, as they are too involved in prayer.

Regardless of whether the PCs have made an alliance with the goblin king, the PCs are not welcome here. Three goblin warriors, unarmed, do not pose a threat in and of themselves, but 6d6 seconds after the PCs enter this room, the Hobgoblin Holy Guard of Stoneshaper—made up of four hobgoblins wielding masterwork longswords—arrive to drive them off.

**Encounter Condition:** Fearless, Hallowed 2

**Tactics:** If the PCs are known by the goblin empire as allies, they merely guide them out of the room, rather forcefully, but as diplomatically as possible. The goblins yell obscenities as the PCs are escorted out.

If the PCs are enemies of the goblins, the hobgoblins are outright aggressive and the goblin zealots grab anything they can find to use as weapons. The goblins lash out, almost hysterical, while the hobgoblins concentrate on the PCs' front rank, using brute strength to push the PCs out of the room, fighting them in the hall, if possible.

**Treasure:** The goblins consider the tapestries of their god priceless, though they hold no value outside this room. The rebel goblins might be interested in taking them, however, so they can defile their enemies' religious icons.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two hobgoblins. To decrease the challenge, remove one goblin.

### B134. THE STATUE OF NORENDITHAS STONESHAPER THE QUICKTHINKING, SMITER OF FOES

The room is dominated by religious iconography; sigils and prayer beads adorn the room. Regardless of what the room was originally designed for, the faith of the goblins has transformed it into something more than it was.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** PCs curious about the statue can inspect it. A DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check or a DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals the statue is a goblin turned to stone. A second check reveals that either a basilisk, cockatrice, or medusa could have done this. PCs succeeding at a third check know that a medusa would leave the statue here to mark the boundary of its lair.

Every five minutes the PCs remain in this room, roll a Random Encounter, with a roll of 1-15 being Nothing and a roll of 19-20 is the Hobgoblin Holy Guard from Room B133 coming to secure the room. A 16, 17, or 18 occurs per this Section's table.

**Encounter Condition:** Fearless, Hallowed 5

**Tactics:** Hobgoblins that enter the room, do not hesitate and swarm the PCs. They flank the PCs in an attempt to subdue them and take them prisoner. Goblins are shaken (-1 to all rolls) for 3 turns upon seeing the PCs in their sacred hall.

This room contains a hidden door to Region C. A DC 25 Investigation check is required to locate the door. A special catch must be released to open the secret door (that slides upwards). A DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check allows the PC to slide their fingers into the slender crevice and open the secret door.

A second secret door lies beyond the first, requiring the same checks to find and open it. The secret doors close on their own after 1 minute.

Neither the goblins nor hobgoblins have located these doors and were unaware of a passage into Region C from this location. If the PCs move on to Region C without dealing with the holy goblin empire, Argliss learns of the secret door in 2d6 days and sends patrols into Region C, looking for a new route to the gnolls. 2d6 days after that, they learn of the cockatrice and the fate of their "god."

**Treasure:** The offerings the goblins have left behind for their deity are in special bowls at the base of the statue. Burnt offerings, copper coins, and trinkets worthless to the PCs fill the bowls. Collectively the contents of the room are worth about 6 gp.

**Scaling:** N/A

### Random Encounters (Shrine)

Roll for a Random Encounter once per hour.

| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | A sharp wind blows through the Section, its source unidentifiable but strong and persistent. Drafty. |
| 2 | A single, sickly feather lies in the middle of the hallway (it's from a cockatrice, though the PCs may not know this initially). |
| 3 | A shrill cackle echoes through the halls, followed by the cooing of a giant bird. Echoes 4. |
| 4-15 | Nothing. |
| 16 | A goblin dressed in ill-fitting leather robes roams the halls. It is one of the keepers of the shrine, his head is bent in prayer. He carries a staff carved in incomprehensible runes. Due to his praying, he suffers disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. |
| 17 | Twelve goblin pilgrims march towards the shrine. Their attitude is Hostile, as they drive the PCs from the Section. |
| 18 | Two hobgoblins, mounted on worgs, and 2d6 goblins patrol the section, safeguarding pilgrims on their journey. Their attitude is Unfriendly, and they order the PCs to leave the area. At the slightest provocation, their attitude becomes Hostile and they attack. |
| 19 | A fire trap (B18) is set in the passageway. |
| 20 | Bartleby searches the Section for his elusive artifact. He is easily agitated and reveals that he believes the artifact must be in the shrine, as it is the only Section he has yet to fully explore. |

### B135. THE KEEPER'S CLOISTER

As you enter the room you see an ornately dressed goblin cowering in the corner. He is wielding a small dagger in a shaky fist. The goblin hisses and sputters curses at you, spittle flying off its lips. It makes no move to advance or attack you, however.

The room is decorated in the same imagery as the antechamber and is finished simply. A small desk, covered in deep red stains, stands against the western wall. Against the southern wall is a simple cot, covered in rags.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** The PCs have entered the personal quarters of the Keeper of the Shrine (5 hp goblin warrior). The keeper is a devout goblin, but not very brave. As long as the PCs do not attack him, the Keeper does not attack them. He curses in Goblin, gesturing in a vulgar manner that the PCs must leave the shrine. He does not speak Common.

The Hobgoblin Holy Guard (Rooms B134 and B136) does not enter the room unless they hear the sounds of combat. They have been trained not to disturb the Keeper's meditation.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 1

**Tactics:** While he babbles he casts *sanctuary* to defend himself. If attacked the Keeper lunges at the closest PC. He knows he does not stand a chance against the PCs, but he cannot dishonor himself further by fleeing.

If the hobgoblins come to his rescue, they attack the PCs and attempt to break them off into two groups. They pin spellcasters and clerics into corners and fight fervently for their religious beliefs. If the Keeper is killed, they fight as though always enraged (see barbarian Rage class feature, their level is equal to their challenge rating).

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### B136. BARRACKS OF THE HOLY GUARD

These cramped quarters house four hobgoblin guards who sit on the floor or on the bunks, their weapons at their sides. The bunks are stacked four high and the room reeks of sweat. Along the southern wall is a weapons rack, now empty.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** The barracks of the Hobgoblin Holy Guard of the Stoneshaper is just as volatile a room as any located in the confines of the shrine. With most of the guardsmen patrolling, hobgoblin guards in this room do not pose a huge threat to the PCs. The guardsmen are relentless in their attacks however hopeless their situation may seem.

**Encounter Condition:** Fearless

**Tactics:** Like the other hobgoblin patrol and guard units, these hobgoblins single out the most powerful PC and attack them en masse. They flank the PCs as often as possible, moving on to the next PC as soon as one is down. They take PC captives to the goblin king unless they are known enemies of the holy empire, in which case they are put to death.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one hobgoblin. To decrease the challenge, remove one.
