# Region C (continued)

## C76. Gelatinous Cube Guardian

This hallway is completely dark. Like many other rooms in this region, the walls are scarred with scuffs and narrow markings, as though something was dragged across them.

There is a large cube made of bluish translucent gelatin in the middle of this hallway. Inside this weird cube is a wooden chest reinforced with golden brackets. The chest appears undamaged.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** A huge gelatinous cube, born from the chaotic magic of Arum's fractured intellect, has grown to enormous strength. It guards the hallway running around the Nardarik's nests (Room C77), with a mimic posing as a treasure chest. The mimic's acid immunity renders it invulnerable to the cube's touch.

These creatures were already here when Nardarik took control of the section and, seeing no need to destroy them, the dragon kept them alive for use as sentries. The gelatinous cube and mimic remain close to the door in the northern stretch of the corridor, but can appear anywhere in the room the GM wishes.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush, [Fear 14], Fearless

**Tactics:** Should the cube suffer 50 or more points of damage, the mimic springs to life and attacks the PCs, surprising them (even if they are already engaged in combat) unless they succeed at a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check.

The cube attacks mindlessly, engulfing the first PC it can. If the cube is successful, the mimic attacks the PC from inside the cube, rather than waiting for an opening. PCs witnessing such an attack must succeed at a DC 12 Wisdom save or become stunned for 2d4 rounds.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have there be two mimics inside the cube, each shaped like treasure chests or desks. To decrease the challenge, have the mimic surprise the PCs only after the cube suffers 60 points of damage.

## C77. Nardarik's Nest

If Nardarik hears the PCs coming (highly likely), the room is already cast in darkness. Otherwise, read the following.

A great mound of copper, silver, and gold coins take up most of the floor space of this vast chamber. Among the coins are multiple pieces of jewelry, such as necklaces, rings, and bracelets, as well as a handful of tapestries, goblets, and utensils. What truly catches the eye, however, is the large dragon sitting atop his treasure. The creature's scales are deep black, bearing several scars, and shaped like jagged diamonds. Fire burns within the pits of its eyes.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Nardarik lives here. Though he frequently patrols his own territory, he is found here most of the time. Like most of his peers, Nardarik is clever, cruel, and malevolent. He sees the PCs' presence in his private realm as an affront to his power and does not hesitate to attack anyone entering its nest.

In order to negotiate with Nardarik, the PCs must first be able to change his initial attitude through the use of Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) checks. Unless the PCs tempt Nardarik by promising great riches to the black dragon, they suffer from a -4 penalty to all Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to change its attitude. If the PCs successfully change the dragon's mind, it listens to what they have to offer hoping to acquire treasure from them. If the PCs fail to pay at least 2,000 gp worth of treasure to Nardarik, combat ensues.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), [Deep Darkness], Fearless, Fog 10, Smoke

**Tactics:** In battle, Nardarik is merciless. If he hasn't already done so, he casts the room into darkness, unless the PCs surprise him, in which case he starts fighting immediately. Before engaging in melee, he uses his line of acid breath (60 ft.), targeting spellcasters. Due to his ferocious nature, he does not breathe acid as often as he can, repeating this action every 1d4+1 rounds.

Once engaged in melee, Nardarik tears into the PCs with claw and bite attacks. If too many PCs surround him, he tail slaps the largest, reducing his opponent's numbers before returning to his breath weapon and claw attacks.

Due to the size of the room, Nardarik keeps his distance when necessary and jumps about for a better position whenever possible. In the darkness, he attacks like a cat, attacking powerful PCs before slinking away to stalk them again.

If the PCs are too strong for Nardarik, he uses darkness and his powerful breath weapon to escape to Room C72.

**Treasure:** Nardarik's treasure hoard includes 8,500 gp worth of small gemstones, assorted coins, and various pieces of jewelry. In a locked (DC 22 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check) wooden chest are a number of unmarked vials. A potion of bless and three potions of healing can be found.

In another locked (DC 22 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check) chest, strapped closed with bands of cold iron, the PCs find one large delicate jade Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals, a small lacquer box (wrapped in silk) containing brushes and Marvelous Pigments, a dark blue Ioun stone, a clear Ioun stone, a plain-looking ring of evasion, a ring of three wishes (with 0 wishes remaining), a ring of resistance (fire) (with a faceted fire opal set in a three-part crown), and an amulet of health that only fits small or smaller creatures.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, give Nardarik an additional Legendary Action. To decrease the challenge, allow the PCs two rounds before Nardarik notices them.

## C78. Converted Hall

This oddly shaped hall was probably two rooms once, but there are now wide gaps in the east and south walls, which open into the second part of it. Though there is nothing special here, the walls and floor bear many scars. The horizontal scarring of the walls suggests that something was dragged up them, and it is obvious that the floor was scarred with claws or sharp tools.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This hall was once two separate chambers, but the doors, and indeed the entire doorways that separated them were destroyed long ago. The oversized archways are scorched and a good portion of the stone walls surrounding them has melted under the effect of an acidic substance.

The secret door in the southernmost portion of the east wall is a simple stone panel that has seen much use in recent years. Because of this, it is easy to discern its discolored shade and the large marks around it. A successful DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check is enough to notice it. When pushed, the panel opens into the narrow corridor and wide chamber beyond.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** After the PCs spend 30 minutes in this room, roll for a random encounter. On a 6-14, a gray ooze or ochre jelly shuffles into the room.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, a gray ooze is already here, dissolving the stone. To decrease the challenge, remove the possibility of a Random Encounter.

## C79. Gray Ooze Prison

The narrow hallway opens into a wide room. This dark chamber is empty except for a puddle of water in the northeastern corner.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** Nardarik keeps a gray ooze prisoner in this room. This creature unwittingly ventured into the black dragon's lair over a year ago and now Nardarik frequently visits the ooze to torment it. The ooze remains motionless and does not attack unless the PCs move within 5 ft., striking the closest target.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush, Cover

**Tactics:** The gray ooze does its best to conceal itself, hiding under cover when possible and generally avoiding outright confrontation. While mindless, months of torture have taught it to lie still and not attract unwanted attention.

If combat is inevitable, unarmored PCs are perfect targets, suffering the gray ooze's acidic touch.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one gray ooze. To decrease the challenge, have the ooze recently tortured by Nardarik (-20 hit points).

## C80-C85. Tricks and Traps

Once serving as powerful prisons for demons and the like, these rooms fell out of favor when the celestials were forced into Regions E and G. Each room in this section is trapped with powerful magic, capable of bringing the strongest PC to his knees. For thousands of years, these rooms have stood as cells, holding pens, and "torture" chambers to remind evil creatures of the price of disobedience.

Since the area is devoid of inhabitants, and filled with traps that discourage travel, Nardarik (Room C77) makes no challenge to annex this territory. Most inhabitants of the region know about this section and avoid it at all costs, leaving the dragon to focus his energies elsewhere. The stone floor is covered with a thick layer of undisturbed dust, suggesting that nothing has entered here in some time. There are no random encounters in this section.

### C80. The Weariness of the Traveler

This room would be perfectly square if it were not for a thin wall separating it into two sections. Though this wall seems out of place, its surface is exactly like the other stone walls in the area. The only difference is that it is narrower than what would be expected.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is rigged with a potent magical device that causes a level of exhaustion to those journeying through it. Anyone traveling through this room, in either direction, falls under its effect. Merely entering the room through one door is not enough to trigger the enchantment, but PCs entering the room from one door and exiting through the other instantly become Exhausted. This effect takes place regardless of the amount of time spent inside the room. There is no save and the condition persists for 24 hours.

**Encounter Condition:** [Fear 16], Haunted, Negative Energy

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add fear to the exhaustion effect. To decrease the challenge, allow each PC a DC 16 Wisdom save to avoid exhaustion.

### C81. The Burden of the Weak

The floor in this room is covered in a layer of thick dust and dirt. With the exception of the seven burning torches set upon the eastern wall, the place is completely empty. A beautiful sigil crisscrosses the stone pattern of the floor, forming an ellipse with intersecting circles.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is trapped with a permanent symbol (stunning) spell that affects anyone who steps on or reads the symbol printed on the center of the floor.

If the symbol is touched or read, everyone in the room must make a DC 16 Wisdom save or be stunned for 1 minute. Anyone who exits the room must save again upon re-entering the chamber and viewing the symbol.

> **Symbol of Stunning Trap**
> - **Detect:** DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Disable:** DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana)

**Encounter Condition:** [Fear 18]

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a symbol (pain) to the symbol of stunning. To decrease the challenge, replace the symbol (stunning) with symbol (sleep).

### C82. The Staggering Strength

The floor of this room is covered with dust, but this substance is darker than most of the dust blanketing the other chambers and hallways of this region.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** 1 round after the PCs enter this room, a powerful gust of wind erupts from tiny cracks in the floor. The gust of wind affects everyone in the room and sends poisonous ungol dust into the air. Living creatures inhaling the dust begin choking immediately and must succeed at a DC 14 Wisdom save or become frightened for 2d6 rounds.

> **Gust of Wind and Ungol Dust Trap**
> - **Detect:** DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Disable:** DC 18 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)

**Encounter Condition:** [Drafty], [Fear 16], Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add chain lightning to the gust of wind and ungol dust trap. To decrease the challenge, remove the ungol dust and instead have the PCs pelted with pebbles and debris (2d6 bludgeoning damage to each player).

### C83. The Mirror of Truth

This small room is empty except for a large mirror mounted on the diagonal northwest wall. The mirror is framed in an orange copper alloy that reflects light nicely. It is a large but otherwise simple piece of furniture.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This tiny chamber is actually a portal to Room C84. To pass through the secret door (or even discover it), the PCs must face the mirror in the northwest corner.

Anyone entering this room must make a DC 17 Wisdom save to resist the Zone of Truth coming from the mirror. Those standing directly in front of the mirror, so as to see their reflections, trigger a magic mouth. Everyone in the room hears "Shelter and comfort await friends who wish it. What is your name?" To everyone else, the mirror is empty, but those who answer, the mirror see through to the other side.

On the other side of the mirror is a lush, yet confined room filled with two three-tiered bunk beds, a modest table, two chairs, and a wash-basin. The mirror is a doorway to Room C84.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Visions

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### C84. Restful Nightmare

A pair of three-level bunk beds dominates this small room. The beds can easily accommodate six medium-sized creatures and thick sheets rest upon them. In addition to the bunks, there are two small chairs, an ivory wash basin, and a large wooden chest.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The basin in this room is filled with cool fresh water. When water is taken out of it, the basin magically refills itself. Regardless of the quantity of liquid taken out of it, the basin constantly refills. The basin is mounted to the floor and cannot be moved or tipped over.

This room was designed to attract demons to safety, instead targeting them with a powerful nightmare. Any PC trying to rest here is subjected to the nightmare.

> **Nightmare Trap**
> - **Detect:** DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Disable:** DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Effect:** Characters resting in the room must make a DC 17 Wisdom save or suffer from the nightmare. Those who uttered their true names in Room C83 receive personalized nightmares, based on events from their past. Those who lied (as demons are apt to, lest they give away their true name) suffer Disadvantage to Wisdom checks and saving throws for 24 hours due to visions of a future that is horrific and inexplicable.

**Encounter Condition:** [Distracting Visions], [Haunted]

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The wooden chest contains extra blankets and pillows for six beds.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add phantasmal killer to the nightmare trap. To decrease the challenge, replace the nightmare trap with a crushing despair trap.

### C85. Angelic Statue

The door to this room is locked. A DC 21 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check is required to open it.

A beautiful statue representing a large female humanoid with mighty wings issuing from her back stands in the middle of this room. Though the statue is cloaked with dust, it is clear her eyes are made of the purest emerald stones.

PCs who did not steal the emeralds are blessed when they leave the room and may rest here as long as they like (so long as the emeralds are untouched).

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is anachronistic in relation to the rest of the section. It looks and feels alien to anything else the PCs have seen so far. Evil-aligned PCs must succeed at a DC 14 Wisdom save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds after entering the room. While this effect is not devastating, it is intimidating.

The celestial angel statue in this room is made of the same stone as the rest of the dungeon. Despite the obvious valueless nature of its material, it is a truly impressive work of art. The emeralds that make its eyes are priceless and foreign to this world. A successful DC 21 Intelligence check confirms these gems are entirely unique and alien, fetching upwards of 10,000 gp each.

The PCs can remove the emeralds from the statue by prying them out with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Three rounds after the precious stones are taken out, they turn into a dull black shape and crumble to dust. Soon after, the real terror begins.

First, when the gems turn to dust, the bearer must succeed at a DC 18 Dexterity save or swallow some of the dust, losing 1d8 maximum hp for 1 week. Second, everyone in the room suffers bane for 2d8 days (no saving throw). Third, a beastly howl fills the room, chilling the PCs to the bone (eyebite). They are allowed a DC 18 Constitution save to negate the effect. Fourth, a wave of exhaustion (no saving throw) strikes everyone in the room.

Each trap effect triggers one after the other in successive rounds.

**Encounter Condition:** [Fear 18], Fearless, Hallowed or Unhallowed, Haunted or Safe, Negative Energy or Positive Energy

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the hit point reduction to 2d8. To decrease the challenge, reduce the duration of all effects to 24 hours.

## C86-C94. Narrow Maze

A multitude of narrow corridors make up most of this section. Because the outlying territory is so dangerous, inhabitants of the region usually avoid this area. Two years ago, a group of adventurers found their way into the dungeon and entered this region, establishing a base of operations in Rooms C86-C91. They passed away soon after. Signs of their passage can be found throughout these isolated chambers.

PCs venturing into the narrow hallways of this area must walk single file.

While Room C94 is technically part of Arnuk's (Room C96) section, she avoids it and commands her sons to do the same. There are no random encounters in this section.

### C86. Former Adventurers' Chamber

Though this small room was originally designed to hold a prisoner, the lock was destroyed long ago.

The stench of decay prevails in this room and a glance inside instantly reveals the source of the foul smell. The body of a dwarf, curled up in the fetal position, lies in the southwest corner. Almost no meat remains upon the skeletal corpse, but the odor of rotted flesh lingers.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Long after its original captive was gone, the room was used as a bed chamber. A dwarven male lies on a rotted blanket in this bed chamber, his cancerous form so diseased it doesn't even attract flies.

Anyone touching or examining the dwarf's body must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution save or contract demon fever. Normally demon fever is spread through injury, but this strain is deadly even centuries after the demon's fled the dungeon.

> **Demon Fever**
> - **Incubation Period:** 24 hours
> - **Effect:** Reduces the infected character's maximum hit points by 2d6 until the disease is cured.

**Encounter Condition:** Diseased (demon fever) 14, Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** There are three old bedrolls in the corner, plus a diseased and rotted blanket on which the dwarf is sleeping. A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a leather scroll case and a small copper holy symbol (worth 5 gp) hidden in the closed skeletal fist of the dwarven corpse. The case contains three divine scrolls: calm emotions, freedom of movement, and protection from evil.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the hit point damage to 3d6. To decrease the challenge, return lost maximum hit points after 1 hour.

### C87. Old Hearth

A circle of blackened stone lies at the heart of this room, with a small pile of gray ashes in its center. It is obvious that this was used as a hearth where fire once burned, but there is no trace of wood anywhere in the chamber.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The adventuring band who lived here used this chamber as a common hall.

**Encounter Condition:** Diseased (demon fever) 14

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check uncovers a half-burnt piece of parchment among the ashes. The last words of what must have been a long paragraph remains intact: "No one knew why they were brought together in the bowels of this forgotten place, except that they would be needed to turn the tide at some forthcoming event. Yet the priests and paladins serving Merunda obeyed the will of their deity."

This parchment is part of Arum's notes and anyone reading "Arum's Journal" and succeeding at a DC 13 Intelligence check notices that the writing on the parchment is identical to that of the wizard's journal in Room C52. This is another fragment of the accounts of the servants of Merunda who lost their lives fighting Ash (Room C21).

**Scaling:** N/A

### C88. Ancient Storeroom

Five small crates and two large sacks crowd this chamber. Though the wood from the crates is rotted, some of the items they contain appear sound.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Before their demise, the adventurers dwelling here stored extra gear in this room.

The door on the west wall is hidden by an illusion, making it appear like the wall. Anyone touching the "door" must succeed at a DC 16 Wisdom save to disbelieve the illusion. Failing this save means the PC is fooled by the illusion.

Those succeeding the save realize the stone wall is an illusion. The illusionary wall never disappears, but those making the save can open the door to Room C89. Due to the nature of the illusion, those who fail their save will never see it as anything but a wall.

**Encounter Condition:** Diseased (demon fever) 14

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The large sacks contain several long cords of rotted ropes, as well as torches, arrows, and bolts in similar states of decomposition. Within the crates, the PCs uncover the rusty end of a grappling hook (with a rotted cord), a well-oiled tent in surprisingly good shape, a hooded lantern, seven oil flasks, flint and steel, and a rusted (but still useful) masterwork climber's kit.

**Scaling:** N/A

### C89. Former Treasure Room

In order to enter this room, PCs must first bypass the illusory wall in Room C88.

The rotted remains of shelving line the walls of this small room. Some of the shelves have fallen atop others, crushing whatever items were displayed on them in their wake. Others remain in place, but it is obvious that they are extremely fragile.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room was once used to store the adventurers' most precious treasures. When the surviving members of the band abandoned their base of operations, they took most of what was valuable in this room.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** There are several broken glass vials, clay pots, and wax candles lying among the debris of the shelves and at first glance there is nothing of value here. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check uncovers three unbroken vials of holy water as well as a +1 battleaxe laying under the crushed shelves of the western wall. The axe's blade is decorated with thick dwarven runes.

**Scaling:** N/A

### C90. Funeral Chamber

The only door leading to this chamber is locked but not trapped. A successful DC 18 Dexterity check is enough to unlock it.

Two stone altars are lined up on the eastern and western walls of this chamber and anyone entering the chamber sees that something rests upon each. Closer inspection reveals two man-sized corpses wrapped in gauzy layers of yellowed wool.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Inside are the bony remains of two human males and their gear. Sigils were painted on the wool, but the paint has faded from red to yellow.

Anyone touching or examining the bodies must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution save or contract demon fever.

> **Demon Fever**
> - **Incubation Period:** 24 hours
> - **Effect:** Reduces the infected character's maximum hit points by 2d6 until the disease is cured.

**Encounter Condition:** Diseased (demon fever) 14

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** PCs searching the corpses find a masterwork battleaxe, a +2 throwing axe, a rusty, but functional breastplate, a pouch containing 71 gp worth of assorted coins, and a small chunk of amber (worth 15 gp).

Each of the items is also riddled with disease and the GM should determine if the PCs can leave without making several Constitution saves.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the hit point damage of demon fever to 3d6. To decrease the challenge, return lost maximum hit points after 1 hour.

### C91. Empty Cell

There is a lock upon the door, but it is busted and completely useless.

The door leading to this room has a barred window set into it, allowing anyone to gaze inside. The floor is cloaked in a thick blanket of undisturbed dust. A closer look reveals that the walls of this cell have discolored into a dull brown shade, as though someone or something had painted them long ago.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This prison cell has not been used in centuries, but once contained a minor demon. A DC 15 Intelligence check made here confirms the walls were painted with blood. The substance dried long ago, but its dark shade can still be seen.

Anyone touching or examining the blood must succeed at a DC 16 Constitution save or contract this powerful strain of demon fever.

> **Demon Fever (Intense)**
> - **Incubation Period:** 24 hours
> - **Effect:** Reduces the infected character's maximum hit points by 4d6 until the disease is cured.

**Encounter Condition:** Diseased (demon fever) 14

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the hit point damage of demon fever to 5d6. To decrease the challenge, return lost maximum hit points after 1 hour.

### C92. Crushing Wall Trap

This room is devoid of light or furniture, but a narrow pile of broken bones takes up most of the central area in this chamber. Crushed skeletons are lined up in the middle of the area, forming an almost straight line from north to south, as if connecting the two corridors opening into this room together.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is rigged with a deadly mechanism designed to hold any creature that escaped its original cell. The bony remains in the center of the room are those of the unfortunate creatures that unwittingly ventured here and never escaped.

Three rounds after anyone enters this room, the east and west walls quickly move towards the center, crushing everyone within one round after this trap is sprung, the walls move back into their proper places.

A minuscule hidden switch can be found with a DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check upon the north wall just east of the archway. Pressing this switch prevents the trap from functioning for 10 minutes.

> **Compacting Room Trap**
> - **Detect:** DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
> - **Disable:** DC 23 Dexterity
> - **Effect:** 3-round delay. No saving throw. All characters suffer 12d6 bludgeoning damage after 1 round.

**Encounter Condition:** [Deep Darkness]

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check is enough to notice an ivory ring on one of the fingerbone remains in the center of the room. The ring is simple, but it is ancient and undamaged. It fits any medium creature and is worth upwards of 750 gp to a collector.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the crushing wall trap's damage to 16d6. To decrease the challenge, make the trap deal only 8d6 points of damage.

### C93. Imprisoned Specter

Due to the design of this room, opening either door is not easy. There are four different locks on each door. Subsequential DC 18, DC 22, DC 25, and DC 28 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) checks are required to unlock them. If any check fails by 10 or more, all the locks reset and the PC must start over. In addition, each lock is trapped with a powerful ward that activates if the lock is tampered with. Each ward is extremely difficult to notice, as the tiny rune is written inside of the locking mechanism.

The first ward is a bestow curse trap.

> **Bestow Curse Trap**
> - **Detect:** DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Disable:** DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Effect:** Characters in the room must make a DC 15 Wisdom save or have disadvantage on all Strength ability checks and saving throws for 8 hours.

The second lock is protected by a symbol (sleep).

> **Symbol of Sleep Trap**
> - **Detect:** DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Disable:** DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Effect:** Characters in the room must make a DC 15 Wisdom save or fall asleep for 10 minutes.

The third lock is protected by symbol (stunning).

> **Symbol of Stunning Trap**
> - **Detect:** DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Disable:** DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Effect:** Characters in the room must make a DC 17 Wisdom save or be stunned for 1 minute.

The fourth lock is guarded by feeblemind.

> **Feeblemind Trap**
> - **Detect:** DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Disable:** DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Effect:** Characters in the room suffer 4d6 psychic damage and must make a DC 12 Intelligence save or their Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. At the end of every 30 days, the characters can repeat the saving throw until they save. The effect can be ended by greater restoration, heal, or wish.

Opening the doors from inside this room requires the PCs to unlock only the last two locks, but the wards protecting these two are still present.

Five massive columns carved from bedrock support the fifty-foot-high ceiling of this great hall. Like most chambers in the dungeon, the area is bathed in shadows, but the disquieting murmurs of some hidden menace echoes through the wide place. Strange mirrors on the floor, ceiling, and walls reflect light in every direction, casting shadows into every corner and distorting the apparent size of the room.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** This chamber holds one of the few original inhabitants of the dungeon: a mighty specter named Aslur'thyn, whose cell was so secure, he never escaped. Magical wards upon the entire stone surfaces of the walls, ceiling, and floor keep him inside. Powerful magic imbues the walls of this special prison cell, trapping all sound inside. This effect acts as silence.

Aslur'thyn has been confined to this cell since the dungeon was first built and has lost all hope of ever escaping. When the PCs open one of the doors leading into its cell, he stares in disbelief for one round. Allow him a DC 20 Wisdom save on the second round. If successful, he rushes for the door, otherwise he waits until the third round to make his escape.

Unless the PCs prevent Aslur'thyn from exiting the room, he flies past them. If the PCs stand in his way or attack him, Aslur'thyn fights back, venting centuries of accumulated anger. If the doors close, trapping him once again inside, he becomes furious and gains the benefit of barbarian rage for 3 minutes.

**Encounter Condition:** Cursed 4, Distracting Noises, Distracting Visions

**Tactics:** Once engaged in battle, Aslur'thyn is relentless and fights until destroyed. He targets the weakest PC, drawing him away or sequestering him from the rest of the party. He continues to attack a single target until either of them is dead. If Aslur'thyn successfully kills a PC (who will return as a spawn 1d3 rounds later), he flees so the PCs are forced to fight one of their own.

If Aslur'thyn flees into the dungeon, he escapes via the fastest route possible, hiding from the PCs if they give chase. If the PCs allow him to escape, he immediately looks for victims to convert to spawns and within 24 hours commands 1d6 specters. This pattern continues until everything is converted or the specter finds an adversary more powerful than himself.

Aslur'thyn heads north, avoiding the dragon and oozes, but attacking any humanoids he finds. If the PCs emptied this region, he heads west in search of goblins in Region B before heading toward Region N. If the PCs chase him to Region F or G, he flies across the lava.

**Treasure:** The specter's cloak is a black robe of the archmagi. The benefits of wearing this robe are bestowed to the wearer against corporeal and incorporeal creatures. If the PCs destroy Aslur'thyn they can take the robe, understanding that it is, of course, evil. The cloak is semi-incorporeal and part of him, but it becomes substantial when Aslur'thyn is destroyed.

The angels hid a powerful tome in this room, keeping its secrets from the world. The mirrors along the walls are part of the specter's torment, reminding him of these trappings, no matter where he looks. But they also serve a second purpose. If the PCs succeed at a DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check, they see a series of nodes on the four outside pillars in the mirrors that they cannot see on the pillars themselves. The center pillar is devoid of these nodes. Clever PCs should note that this means something, but a DC 21 Intelligence reveals the nodes are part of a grand puzzle.

It takes a while for the PCs to study the nodes and note subtle differences in their shape and color. After an hour, allow the PCs a DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check to confirm the four nodes that are identical. If the PCs can find a way to touch them all at the same time (they are all placed in such a way that no two can be touched at once by a large or smaller being), the center pillar slowly opens from top to bottom like a giant puzzle box. As each stone shifts, more and more light from the pillar's core releases until 5 minutes later the room is bathed in daylight.

Once the pillar is completely opened (a process that takes 30 minutes), a small pedestal remains, with a book resting on it. This process also disables the traps on the locks, until the pillars are reset by pressing the nodes again (which closes the pillar). The book is shielded by great magic and any PC touching it sets off a divine word trap which resets in 5 rounds.

> **Divine Word Trap**
> - **Detect:** DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Disable:** DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana)
> - **Effect:** Characters touching the book must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is deafened for 1 minute. On a 15, the creature is deafened and blinded for 10 minutes. On a 10 the creature is blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour. On a 5 or lower, the creature is killed instantly. Celestials, elementals, fey, or fiends that fail are forced back to their plane of origin and cannot return for 24 hours.

If the PCs find a way to bypass the divine word trap, they can take the book, which is in fact, a vile tome containing every arcane necromancy spell ever written. Every necromancy spell from the wizard, sorcerer, or cleric spell lists in the Player's Handbook is here. It is up to the GM if these spells are from other open source material or just so powerful and incomprehensible the PCs can never learn them. The book radiates strong Necromancy and evil. If they do not disable the divine word trap, the book can only be removed from the pedestal by a lawful good character.

In addition, the surface of the book is protected by a glyph of warding, which goes off once the PCs read the cover. If they open the book to the first page, the character must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, or a magical snake leaps out and sinks its teeth into the character, and vanishes. The character suffers 6d8 poison damage and must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the damage reduces their maximum hit points by an amount equal to the damage taken for 24 hours. Neither effect can be dispelled or disabled and neither harm the book.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a specter or wight, neither of which wants to leave but instead intends to convert the PCs into the undead. In addition, they can use 'life drain' on animals as well as humanoids. To decrease the challenge, place daylight in the center of the room in a 20-ft. radius that affects Alsur'thyn as sunlight.

### C94. Crushing Grate Trap

The floor of this great hall is arranged with a multitude of square tiles. Gray dust covers most of the floor, but it fails to hide the dented and chipped stone surface. Within each of the cracks separating the floor tiles, caked blood can be seen.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The floor of this chamber is rigged with countless pressure plates. Each 5-ft.-by-5-ft. stone square making up the floor of the hall is part of a deadly mechanism that sends a heavy stone grate to the ground. This grate is made of the same stone as the rest of the region, is as large as the room, and is supported from the ceiling by massive iron poles. When more than 50 lbs. are put upon one of the pressure plates, the grate descends to the floor and crushes everyone inside.

When not activated, the grate looks like it is part of the ceiling. The only differences being that there are a multitude of small holes (some six inches in diameter) cutting through its surface and dried blood is all over it. It can be spotted with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check, which also alerts anyone proficient with Thieves' Tools of the danger.

> **Stone Grate Trap**
> - **Detect:** DC 16 Wisdom (Perception)
> - **Disable:** DC 14 Dexterity
> - **Effect:** 2-round delay. No saving throw. All characters suffer 10d6 bludgeoning damage after 1 round.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the difficulty of this encounter, have the stone gate trap deal 14d6 points of damage. To decrease the challenge, have it deal 6d6 damage.

## C95-C102. Hill Giants' Lair

This section is the home of Arnuk, a hill giant cleric, and her two sons. Arnuk's family was part of a tribe that once dominated a large section of this region. But when Nardarik (Room C77) came, he killed off most of the tribe and drove the survivors away. Arnuk and her sons are the only remaining hill giants from this once-proud tribe.

To make matters worse, Vernir, one of Arnuk's sons, once made a deal with the king of the goblins (Room B75) to fight the wizard Arum for them. Even in his maddened state, Arum was too much for the giant and Vernir nearly lost his life. Fortunately, the wizard showed mercy and only trapped the giant behind several layers of stony walls, rather than kill him. Arnuk and her other son now bear a deep grudge, but are unaware that Arum is gone. Lastly, the giants no longer trust the goblins and seek vengeance, should they ever find a way to escape.

Though they are content with their existence, these hill giants are trapped in the region and have little hope of ever emerging from the dungeon. They do not know about the secret door in Room C61, nor can they get past the imprisoned specter (Room C93). If they ever escape, Arnuk plans to destroy the black dragon Nardarik (Rooms C69-C79), the entire goblin tribe (Region B), and Arum.

Unless the PCs are Hostile, Arnuk asks them to do her bidding by talking about the great riches stolen from her people by the evil dragon Nardarik, as well as the treachery of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. If the PCs agree to help Arnuk get rid of her enemies, they are welcome in her lair. If the PCs do not want anything to do with the hill giants, Arnuk and her sons insist that they exit their private domain. If the PCs know a way out, they handsomely reward them and offer an alliance.

Due to the size of the corridors, the giants are rarely found outside Room C97. Their speed is cut in half in these tight hallways.

### C95. Prison Cubicles

This room is divided into smaller sections by a number of walls. Though these walls are made from the same stone as the rest of the chamber, and indeed most of the dungeon, they are thinner and obviously designed to break the room into small cubicles. Within each of these cubicles, rusted iron chains and manacles hang from the walls.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is segmented into smaller alcoves where minor demons were kept in chains centuries ago. There are enough chains and manacles in this chamber to keep 14 medium creatures shackled. Though the chains are rusty, they remain solidly encased within the walls. The manacles, on the other hand, have all been forced open and are now completely useless.

The secret door on the northeastern wall is seldom used nowadays, but the stone is marked with several dents and its edges are beginning to crumble. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check is enough to notice the stone panel, which can be easily pushed open.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air, Unhallowed 3

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### C96. Bone Room

Large bones litter the floor of this room, covering most of its stone surface. The bones seem old and, judging by the accumulated dust upon them, have not been disturbed in a while. Within the debris are several skulls, which resemble humanoid heads, only bigger.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Arnuk and her sons piled the remains of some dead hill giants here. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check confirms the bones are those of hill giants. Twelve corpses can be found.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** This room is filled with hill giant bones from Arnuk's former tribe. A successful DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a golden tooth in a giant's jaw. The tooth is large and made of pure gold (150 gp).

**Scaling:** N/A
