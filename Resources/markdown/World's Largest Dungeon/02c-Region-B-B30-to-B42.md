# Region B (continued)

## B30. Goblinoid Remains

The moment you enter this room you find the remains of seven goblins and three bugbears littering the floor. From what you can discern, two scouting parties encountered each other here and laid waste to one another. Broken clubs and spears are strewn amongst the corpses and the scent of death hangs heady in the air. A bone-chilling screech suddenly echoes throughout the halls. Something is heading your way.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
The scent of death has attracted two **vargouilles** to this room. Roll for initiative, the PCs have 24 seconds before they arrive. The PCs can choose to lay in wait for the vargouilles or they can flee. When the vargouilles arrive they notice PCs who are not hiding instantly. They attack the PCs on sight, hoping to add to the pile of corpses already in the room.

### Encounter Condition
Cover

### Tactics
The vargouilles assault the PCs with diving attacks. They rely heavily on their **shriek** attack, which can paralyze the PCs. They attack any paralyzed PCs, using their poison and kiss attacks on them.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one vargouille. To decrease the challenge, remove one vargouille.

## B31. The Rod in the Rock

A squat stalagmite sits in the center of this coarsely carved room. The atmosphere is dank, but not overwhelming like some of the other rooms in the dungeon. Protruding straight up from the center of the stalagmite is a carved staff of dark stained oak. The top of the staff is fitted with a gleaming steel cap in the shape of an eagle claw.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
A quarterstaff is buried in the stalagmite, and it serves as the trigger to the room's trap. Pulling the staff before the trap is disarmed triggers it, flooding the room with darts that shoot from recesses in the wall.

If the PCs disarm the trap, they can attempt to remove the quarterstaff; a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check is required to free the quarterstaff from its prison. If the PC performing the check has proficiency in Animal Handling, they gain advantage on the check.

**Spring-loaded Darts.** When the staff is fully removed from the pedestal a spray of darts snap across the room. Starting from the east wall any creature not completely obscured by another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage and be poisoned until their next long rest.

The trap-holes can be found with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled with a DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand). Undoing this mechanism leaves the darts open for the taking. The first time a dart deals damage it loses its poison and poisons the damaged creature if they fail a DC 14 Constitution save.

### Encounter Condition
[Safe]

### Tactics
The only door to this room is a secret door that closes 2d6 rounds after it opens. Opening the door from this side requires a DC 23 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. This DC increases by +5 if the PCs triggered the trap.

### Treasure
The staff is indeed magical. A PC that retrieves it is the proud owner of a **+1 defending quarterstaff**. Defending items grant +1 AC to their wielder while they aren't wearing armor.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, replace the dart trap's poison with exhaustion. To decrease the challenge, reduce the DC for finding the trap by -4.

---

## B32. Blink Dog Den

As soon as you step into the room you are met with a chorus of growls. Four golden dogs, fangs bared, stare at you. You have obviously intruded upon their home, and you are not welcome here. Curiously, they make no move to attack you, as they wait for you to exit on your own.

### Initial Attitude
Unfriendly

### Encounter
The PCs have entered another blink dog den. The **blink dogs** (hit points 35, 31, 28, 23) do not appreciate the PCs' presence and want them out of the room. They bare their fangs and growl at the PCs. However, due to their nature, the blink dogs do not attack the PCs; they only wish to scare them away. If the PCs make no move to leave, the blink dogs slowly advance on the PCs, hoping to drive them off. If any PCs attack the dogs, they immediately retaliate. Successful Wisdom (Animal Handling) (DC 14) checks calm the dogs for 2d6 minutes. Success also allows the PCs to remain and investigate the room, though the blink dogs are obviously not happy with the PCs' presence. Failure of this check changes the blink dog's attitude to Hostile; they do not like being manipulated. 

There is a secret door on the west wall, leading to Room B31. A successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals a hollow stone that can be pried open with a successful DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Once the hallowed stone is open, the PCs can see a lever that must be turned 90 degrees clockwise.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
If attacked, the blink dogs launch themselves at the PCs, focusing on the most aggressive PCs first (or in the case of a PC failing a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, they are focused first). They concentrate their attacks, targeting one PC at a time. They use their blink ability to flank the PCs. Because of the nature of the dungeon, their blink ability is sporadic and has a 70% chance of failing. If successful, however, they flank the hapless PC.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one blink dog. To decrease the challenge, remove one blink dog.

## B33. Bugbear Store Room

This is a simple granite room. Along the northern wall is a plain rack, covered with spears and a few clubs. The weapons are too large for goblins, or smaller creatures, so this is most likely a storeroom for the bugbears in the dungeon. The room does not seem to have been visited lately, and the hallway outside is as quiet as a tomb.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The bugbears used this room as a makeshift armory for a while. Although they rarely come here now, there are spears and greatclubs stored on weapon racks. To protect their cache, the bugbears have rigged a simple spear trap, which is easy enough to spot. Stepping within 5 ft. of the weapons rack triggers the trap unless it is first disabled.

**Crude Spear Trap.** Any PC rolling higher than a 12 on a Wisdom (Perception) check in the room easily spots the spears under tension near the rack. These spears spring forward if the trigger (a weave of wooden poles hidden under a hide on the floor, spanning the 5 ft area in-front of the weapon rack) is activated. Disarming it is as simple as knocking each of the two spears over, where their springs worthlessly engage and disarm themselves. PCs that fail to notice the spears or charge in heedlessly, thus triggering the trap, must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or receive 1d8 piercing damage per spear remaining.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
The PCs have their choice of four longspears, two greatclubs, one large warhammer, and one shortbow. Upon inspection, the weapons are simple and sturdy, but hardly special.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the crude spear trap fire four spears. To decrease the challenge, reduce the damage of the spear trap to 1d4.

---

## B34. Shrine of the Warrior

Moss covers the walls and ceiling of the room. Against the eastern wall is a statue of a hobgoblin. The statue holds a gleaming short-sword in its right hand, and a sharp looking ax in its left. The overall pose gives you a sense that this was a mighty warrior, and this is hallowed ground.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
As the statue suggests, this room was converted into a shrine by the hobgoblins of the dungeon. Since the hobgoblins no longer inhabit this Section, this room has been abandoned. While the weapons are fitted snugly into the statue, they can be removed with minimal effort by the PCs. This requires a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check for each weapon. Any attempt to remove the weapons triggers a deafening alarm. But, with no hobgoblins in the vicinity, no one responds.

### Encounter Condition
Hallowed 2

### Tactics
After the PCs trigger the alarm in this room, roll for two Random Encounters, and resolve them soon, but still somewhat apart.

### Treasure
The ax in the statue's left hand is a **+1 battleaxe** and the sword in the statue's right hand is a **+1 shortsword**.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, after the PCs trigger the alarm, roll for three Random Encounters, spaced 6d6 seconds apart. To decrease the challenge, remove the alarm.

---

## B35. The Pedestal

Brightly polished marble tiles are intricately arrayed on the floor of this room. Dark granite walls and a high limestone ceiling frame it. A large pedestal with a bright red, velvet cushion placed upon it, sits majestically in the center of the floor. The floor surrounding the pedestal is covered with a tile mosaic that depicts a giant snake eating its own tail.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Whatever purpose this room once served, or what the pedestal held, has been lost. The room's defenses, however, are still active. Any PCs that touch the pedestal trigger a hail of needles trap.

**Hail of Needles.** When the pedestal is touched, a room-wide trap triggers. Slots in the ceiling drop fistfuls of needles into the room. Creatures within the room with no way to take cover (shields, helmets, nearby larger PCs) receive 1d8 piercing damage. From then on, every 5 ft. moved within the room deals another 1d4 piercing damage. This trap does not reset for a few weeks.

The mechanism can be spotted with a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled by succeeding a DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
Whatever was on the pedestal is no longer there, and the pedestal contains no secret compartments. Invisible symbols have been drawn on the top of the pedestal, however, but these can only be found with **detect magic** (though once seen remain visible), which reveals a series of arcane marks, laid out in a replicating pattern. A DC 15 Arcana check reveals that the sigils hint to a riddle or answer to a riddle. The PC may study the symbols for 1 hour, requiring another DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check success to maintain concentration that long. If successful, the arcane marks explain how to open the secret door leading to Room B55.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, change the hail of needles trap to the raining shards trap in Room B5 (with the trigger changed to the pedestal). To decrease the challenge, have the trap only deal its damage for every 10 ft. of movement.

---

## B36. Wooden Cage

The floor, walls, and ceiling of the room are covered with wood paneling. The paneling is smooth and even, but the smell of dry rot permeates the air. There is no discernable damage, however. Sitting in the middle of the room is a burlap sack. Gold coins spill out of the top of the sack and litter the floor around it. As you make your way towards the sack, the door behind you slams shut, sealing you in.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Similar to the Hall of Mirrors (Room B6), this room was designed by the celestials as a test of the prisoner's intelligence. A sack, resting on a giant pressure-sensitive trigger, serves as bait. Anyone who steps within 10 ft. of the sack also steps on the trigger, and the trap activates. Once the trap is activated the door slams shut and is impossible to open without resetting the trap.

The reset mechanism is located behind a wooden panel in the northeastern corner. The panel must be removed carefully to reset the trap; if not, the PCs have another danger to contend with. Noxious gasses have built up behind the rotting wood and the PCs must take the proper precautions when removing the panel, or they'll flood the room with the toxic gas. The panel isn't hard to find. While its purpose is not clear, PCs should be made aware of its existence when they start searching the room.

When pried open the gases inside burst forth. A DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) lets a PC reach in and flip the release lever once per hour. Each hour the gasses take their toll, dealing 1d8 poison damage to all creatures in the room if they fail a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. PCs reaching for the lever take double damage as they get a face full.

When the door opens the gasses quickly vent into the hallway and the room becomes safe again.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
The sack contains ten vials of **holy water**, which prisoners might find useless but the PCs may be able to put to use.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, change the trap into an acid fog, dealing 2d8 acid damage each hour. To decrease the challenge, lower the DC of the Constitution save of the trap by -2.

---

## B37. Trapped Howlers

As the PCs approach the door to this room, read the following.

The stone door in front of you doesn't look right. All the other doors you have seen so far have been flush with the surrounding walls. This one, however, looks slightly cocked, as if it has been jammed shut. Loud whining howls pierce through the stone door, flooding the area directly in front of it with a cacophonous noise.

If the PCs put their ear to the door, they hear the moan of the howlers, forcing them to make DC 12 Wisdom saves or be frightened of the howlers for 1 minute. The door to this room has been locked and the lock damaged by rough hands. A DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check is required to open the door. After the PCs open the door, read the following.

As you open the door the noise grows louder as a pair of beasts jump from the shadows. The beasts resemble spiny-backed hounds, which are hard to make out due to the thick smoke filling the room. Your curiosity is cut short as the beasts lunge in your direction.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
A party of bugbears has trapped two **howlers** inside the room. They also left a fire burning in the center of the room in the hopes of suffocating the howlers. Sadly, the bugbears do not understand that howlers are not mammals from this plane and thus not subjected to the same laws for breathing. The howlers have not been trapped for long, but they are nevertheless eager to depart. As soon as the door is opened they rush in, hoping to escape. With the PCs in their way, however, they turn their attention to them, violently taking out their frustrations on the PCs.

### Encounter Condition
Smoke

### Tactics
The howlers attack the closest PC first, latching on with their jagged teeth. They thrash about, impaling the PC on their quills. The howlers fight ravenously for 2d4 turns, at which point they get their wits about them and fight more sensibly, flanking the PCs.

### Treasure
Once the PCs have dealt with the howlers they are free to inspect the room. Aside from scratches on the walls, obviously the work of the trapped howlers, there is nothing of note. The wood in the center of the room has been smoldering for some time, however, blanketing the contents in ash. Allow the PCs DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) checks to locate a **silver dagger**, in the corner of the room, coated with ash.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one howler. To decrease the challenge, remove one howler.

---

## B38. Ruined Observatory

The door to this room has been smashed open, its remains strewn about the doorway. The interior is a now-familiar sight. The room contains a simple stone desk and chair, and a bookshelf against the back wall. A large pile of books lies in front of the shelf. An ear-piercing whine sounds from within the pile, and you spot a strange-looking lizard, with a triangular head, rifling through the refuse.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
This room is identical to other celestial observatories, the major difference being that something has found it and ruined it. The **ethereal marauder** chanced upon the room and is tossing its contents, turning over books and chairs.

The ethereal marauder may not notice the PCs as they enter the room, busily digging through the room's contents (suffering a -2 penalty to Wisdom (Perception) checks). If the PCs remain in the room for more than 30 seconds allow the marauder another Wisdom (Perception) check.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
If the ethereal marauder notices the PCs, it becomes startled and attacks. If the PCs attack it before it notices them, the ethereal marauder flees immediately.

### Treasure
The books in this room are ruined. While they are mostly journals and textbooks, they offer no insight into what the celestials had observed from this room. Allow the PCs a DC 25 Intelligence (History) check to uncover information about the maze in Room B92. If successful the PCs uncover details about its twisting, impossible passages and the deadly nature of the maze. Despite its dangers, demons trying to escape the prison would run through the maze, quickly losing their bearings.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one ethereal marauder. To decrease the challenge, reduce the ethereal marauder's hit points by 5.

---

## B39. Hall of the Hobgoblins

The door leading to this room is locked, requiring a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock it. If the check fails by more than 10, roll a d20, on 1-3 the thieves' tools are jammed in the lock and ruined.

Rotted benches and tables fill this cavernous space. The floor is littered with scraps of cloth and bone, as well as less inviting piles of refuse. Something used this room as a meeting place or base of operations, but it hasn't been used in quite some time. At the back of the hall, against the northern wall, is a large stone throne and dais.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Before the hobgoblins joined forces with their goblin cousins, they made their home here. While they have long since abandoned this room, some of their belongings, shortspears, and clubs scattered amongst the refuse and debris, remain. They also left behind the throne of their chieftain, and it still sits on its dais under a thick layer of dust.

### Encounter Condition
Distracting Visions

### Tactics
After the PCs spend 30 minutes in this room, roll for a Random Encounter.

### Treasure
Hidden in the throne, behind a secret panel, is a **+1 greatclub**. A DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check is required to find the panel, while a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check opens it. Scattered around the room are twelve javelins, two spears, six clubs, 14 arrows, and six poisoned arrows (basic poison).

### Scaling
N/A

## B40. Hallway

If you do not want to alert the PCs to the trap in this hallway, do not read the following.

You find yourself in a simple hallway. The walls and floor are smooth, and nothing is very out of the ordinary. Something prickles at the base of your neck, however, as things may not be exactly as they appear. At the far end of the hallway, you can hear a dull, roaring sound, like howling wind.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
A well-camouflaged pit lies in wait for any PCs traversing this expanse of a hallway. If the PCs travel more than halfway through the hall, they trigger the trap, falling into the 50 ft. deep pit.

PCs that roll higher than a 14 on Wisdom (Perception) checks in this room notice the suspicious nature of the floor. Each step is much more hollow than usual, the gaps where they shouldn't be, etc. Disabling the trap requires wedging the hidden hinges along the sides of the walls, by succeeding a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check with the right tools.

While intended to be a smooth deathtrap, time and nature have worn the pit enough to allow PCs to climb out, should they survive the fall.

### Encounter Condition
Echoes 10

### Tactics
At the east end of the hallway is a spotless room. On the west end is an open door leading to Room B41.

### Treasure
At the bottom of the pit are a few piles of broken bones, one of which still clutches 3d6 gp.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, trigger the trap on a failed Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. To decrease the challenge, reduce the pit depth to 30 ft.

---

## B41. Howler Den

The door to this room is open. If the PCs fell into the pit in Room B40, then the howlers hear them coming and are not surprised, taking cover in the room. Otherwise, the howlers make Wisdom (Perception) checks at advantage for the purposes of the PCs sneaking up on them.

As you approach the open door, deep growls escalate from inside. Something lives here.

If the PCs succeed at DC 13 Perception checks, read the following.

Peeking your head in, you see three hounds, with fibrous quills on their backs.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
The PCs have entered a howler den, although (fortunately) the entire pack is not nearby. There are normally as many as ten pack members, but presently there are only three **howlers**. As soon as the PCs enter, the howlers unleash their mighty howls, wasting no time forcing the PCs from their sanctum.

### Encounter Condition
Fearless, [Safe]

### Tactics
The howlers attack as a pack, lashing out at the nearest PC and dragging them to the ground. If a PC presents themself as the biggest threat, the howlers deal with him first. The howlers bite the PCs, latching on with their jagged teeth. Once engaged, they use their quills to entangle their opponents.

### Treasure
A small nest lies in the corner, against a stone that is slightly warmer than the others. In the nest are the remains of an elf skeleton that stumbled into this lair some 5 years ago. The bones have been thoroughly gnawed on and the finger bones lay about the nest. A golden ring can be found in the nest with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception check). The ring is worth only about 25 gp but has the name **Ellinorith** written on it. Ellinorith is an elven deserter and should the PCs mention the ring or his name to the elves in Region H, they confer that he got what was coming to him.

If the PCs investigate the stone, allow an Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (DC 15) check to pull one of the bricks from the wall. Some kind of tool will be needed. A thin piece of metal works, but shimmying it between the mortar takes some time. Once removed, the PCs find a piece of **amber** that gives off heat in a 5 ft. radius. The heat is around 110 degrees and is perfect for putting under a blanket or in the bottom of a pot to heat water. The amber never stops radiating heat.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one howler. To decrease the challenge, remove one howler.

---

## B42. Well of Healing

The room looks much like the others in this expanse of the dungeon but the floor is littered with rubble and rocks. At the back of the room is a simple stone well. The rope attached to the well's frame extends straight down and is taut.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The well contains a small treasure and the room is designed to prevent anyone from retrieving it. The rubble on the floor shows the aftermath of the trap, and it is the only clue the PCs have regarding the nature of the room. The trap is triggered when the handle on the well is turned. Triggering the trap unleashes stone blocks from the ceiling, which fall down on the PCs. The trigger is located in the well itself, a discolored stone on the backside of the well marks the trigger location.

Triggering the trap causes a huge block to fall from the ceiling, crushing any PCs who fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw for 6d4 bludgeoning damage. This trap resets in 2 minutes.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
Once the trap is disarmed, the PCs may haul up the bucket attached to the bottom of the rope. There is no water in the bucket (as there is no water at the bottom of the well), but it does contain three vials of shimmering blue liquid. Smart PCs should realize this is a great place to store supplies. Someone, perhaps Bartleby (Room B28), figured out the trap and placed the vials here for future use. The PCs should feel confident few people know how to get past the trap and can thus store items here safely. If the PCs store anything in the bucket, there is an 85% chance the items will be here when they return. For each week that passes, roll again for these items.

### Treasure
In the bucket are three vials; each is a **healing potion**.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the damage of the falling block trap to 6d6. To decrease the challenge, lower the damage to 6d3.

---

## B43. The Masher

The floor in this room is scuffed and heavily scratched. Aside from that, it is empty, framed by unmarked granite walls. Off towards your right is a simple wooden door leading to another room.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
While the room is empty, it is not without its perils. The walls conceal poisoned spikes that only trigger when the door to the adjoining room is opened. Once triggered the spikes spring out of the northern and southern walls, and the northern wall slowly moves toward the other. In addition, the doors to the south shut and lock, requiring a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 17) check to pick. If the PCs trigger the trap it is still possible to reset it while it is moving, but the difficulty is increased. When the PCs disable the trap or manage to get the door open, they can enter the adjoining room to the east, which contains the remains of a few elves who died in here. The GM should feel free to give them a full complement of equipment though.

### Encounter Condition
Negative Energy, Stagnant Air

**Masher.** When the handle to the door to the adjoining room is pulled the north and south walls sprout 1.5 ft. spikes and begin moving. Both doors close and lock if they were not already, sealing the PCs in. The mechanism swings with such force that any creature caught in the doorway is shoved inside. Once the room is sealed the walls slowly begin to push together, stopping only when they are 3 ft. apart.

A maintenance panel is hidden next to the door on the east wall, requiring a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find. When rolling Perception checks in the room take note of any PC that rolls greater than a 12 or 15. Those who roll a 15 or greater notice the trap box immediately. Similarly, those who roll a 12-14 notice the box, but only when the walls start moving. The soft clink and hum of gears inside giving the hidden panel's position away.

Disabling the trap is only a matter of jamming the gears. PCs may attempt Strength (Athletics) (DC 14) with appropriate items to achieve this. Succeeding will halt the walls. Alternatively, a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check may be attempted to tamper with the reset timer. The PCs get one try at it, taking the roll, reducing it by 5 (10 if the trap is in motion), then multiplying it by 3. That amount of minutes is taken off the 1 hour reset time.

Touching the spikes at any point deals 2d6 piercing damage, and poisons creatures who do not succeed a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.

If an enterprising PC wishes to test their strength against the walls: A contested grapple check using Strength (Athletics) is performed against the wall. It possesses a strength score of 26, adding +13 to its check to contest the grapple. If the PC manages to succeed, the wall is halted for 3d10 minutes, while the reset timer continues to run.

Each grapple attempt applies the spike damage twice as the grappler contends with not only the mechanism, but the barbs pressing against them.

### Tactics
Once the walls press together, there is a 3 ft. gap from one to the other. They remain pressed together for 1 hour, during which time the PCs must succeed a Constitution save (DC 10, +1 per previous save) every 10 minutes to stave off the strain of balancing, or buckle and lean momentarily against the poisoned wall spikes (suffering damage each time).

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the trap's damage by 1d6. To decrease the challenge, decrease the trap's damage to 1d6.

## B44. Dead Worgs

This large room is nearly empty. The walls are black and gray, and very clean. However, three massive blood-covered wolves lay over the corpses of two dead dogs. Blood mats their hair and stains their mouths. Their skin is black and much of their hair has been singed. The heavy smell of burnt flesh fills the air.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The PCs have stumbled upon a trapped room that worgs and dogs were fighting in before triggering the fire spray trap. The trap is very potent, but with the dead bodies, easy to spot. However, if the PCs stumble upon the trigger without being careful, they suffer the same fate as the creatures.

**Fire Spray Trap.** When triggered, a tiny hole in the wall flips open and releases a gout of alchemist's fire. A cone of rapidly igniting liquid chars everything in its path. Creatures within the room must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 fire damage. The trap resets in 5 minutes.

### Tactics
The trigger for this trap is a single small stone set in the floor 6 ft. from the door, shaped like any other in the room. Careful PCs can easily avoid and disable it by wedging something underneath. Wisdom (Perception) checks that roll a 16 or higher notice scuff marks on the edges of adjacent stones that reveal its ability to move. The corpses are three worgs and two blink dogs that fought in this room, before one tripped the fire spray trap, killing them all. If the PCs clear the air of smoke, avoid the trigger (or disable it), and bar the door, the room is considered Safe.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, remove the bodies and add an empty backpack in the center of the room as a lure. To decrease the challenge, reduce the damage of the trap to 3d6.

## B45. The Golden Idol

This large room is lined with bright, shiny steel. Light bounces off the steel in every direction, blinding you. On columns throughout the room are ledges lined with lit candles. In the center of the room, on a simple wooden table, is a golden idol. The figure is about three feet tall, ornately carved, and resembles a beautiful angel, holding aloft a torch. The room gives off a peaceful feeling, as if it was a shrine at some point.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The idol is a tribute from one celestial to another; it honors the celestial's sacrifices in constructing and defending the dungeon complex, though this is not readily apparent to the PCs. Inscribed on its base is a message (in Celestial). "In darkness, I bring light, never straying from my path." Removing the idol from the table triggers a trap.

**Chaotic Lightning Trap.** Upon a platform sits a pedestal, with an idol upon a pressure plate. The PCs should be made aware of the plate moving as they take the idol unless they rush it. If 35 lbs. (half the weight of the idol) is removed from or added to the pressure plate under the idol, the trap casts a **lightning bolt** spell at 3rd level at the platform. Creatures that fail their saving throw against this are knocked prone. Once the spell resolves the bolt ricochets off the steel walls 1d4 times, striking the PCs once more each time. Prone PCs have advantage on Dexterity saving throws to avoid this trap, and take no damage on a success. The trap can be disabled by correctly weighing down the pressure plate. Lawful good PCs (or those you feel exemplify the alignment's values) are immune to the damage of this trap.

### Encounter Condition
Hallowed 5, Positive Energy, [Safe]

### Tactics
If the PCs extinguish all the candles, the torch on the statue lights up, casting the **daylight** spell at 3rd level. This is true anytime the statue is taken into a dark room. This effect cannot be controlled and only turns off when there is a light source nearby. This room has an undoubtedly mysterious air to it. The GM should feel free to add whatever elements are lacking to keep the PCs in this room, examining every nook and cranny. If the PCs never disturb the idol, the room is considered Safe.

### Treasure
The golden idol weighs about 70 lbs., and is worth approximately 1,000 gold pieces.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge, change the chaos lightning trap to cast **chain lightning** and decrease the 1d4 ricochets to 1d2. To decrease the challenge, reduce the damage prone PCs take by half.

---

## B46. Bugbear Forward Post

A crude map of the dungeon, written in rough, goblinoid script, is on the southern wall. It marks the locations of various rooms, and the rune for goblin is repeated over and over on its surface. Standing in the center of the room are three tall goblinoids, with sharp fangs and heavy coats of fur. They are armed and angry, roaring with a defiant battle cry.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
The PCs have stumbled upon a secret staging area of the bugbears, hidden among the trap-infested rooms of this section. Safe from their goblin enemies, they plan their attacks from here. This room provides easy passage to an expanse of claimed rooms (B1 through B45), but also to the last remaining bugbear stronghold (rooms B52 through B68).

The room is currently occupied by three **bugbears**. If the PCs make any sound opening the door the bugbears gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. If the PCs go unnoticed allow the bugbears a second check after thirty seconds. If the bugbears notice the PCs, they become incensed by the intrusion and attack.

### Encounter Condition
Echoes 2

### Tactics
Caught off guard, the bugbears assault the PCs ferociously. The bugbears work individually, attacking the PC closest to them. While it is possible to parlay during battle, the bugbears are more concerned with silencing anyone that would report this room back to Argliss (Room B75).

### Treasure
While there is no treasure, per se, the map drawn on the wall can easily be copied onto parchment, giving the PCs a much-needed help navigating the Region. A door near Room B6, to the north, is circled and marked (in Goblin), "Kneed Kee." If the PCs spend an hour transferring the map to paper, give them proficiency in Dexterity (Stealth, Sleight of Hand), Wisdom (Perception), and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made anywhere in the Region. This map lacks Rooms B55, B57, and B59 through B62. PCs that have the map from Room B25 notice this after spending 2 hours comparing the two maps; or in 1 hour if they succeed at a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one bugbear. To decrease the challenge, remove one.

## B47. Chamber of Echoes

Sounds echo from the walls of this vacant room. A series of noises follow giving the impression that footsteps are simply more unnatural sounds originating from this room. Human wailing surrounds you. Hanging from the ceiling is a rusty sword tied with a length of rotting rope.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The sword is a trigger for a crawling claw trap. If the PCs find a way to remove the sword and replace its weight with something else on the rope, they can disable the trap. Otherwise, the trap triggers as soon as the PCs lower the sword.

**Crawling Claw Trap.** The trap is the rope itself. Enchanted with necromancy, it brims with latent magic, dying to be unleashed. It glows with a pale light when viewed by those with magical sight. It otherwise presents as mundane. Removing the sword without tying another object to the rope triggers the trap. Once triggered, 2d4 **crawling claws** burrow out from under the various stones, each echoing the alien sounds as they attack.

### Encounter Condition
Distracting Noises, Echoes 10

### Tactics
No sounds actually originate from this room, but instead are amplified from other Regions in the dungeon. This room has become a nexus for noise and the PCs are actually hearing conversations and battles going on in Regions E, G, I, and N.

### Treasure
The sword is a **featherweight longsword** that needs to be cleaned and sharpened but otherwise has survived the ravages of age. The word "sanctify" is written along the blade in Celestial. Featherweight weapons weigh half that of weapons of the same type (in this case longswords), gain thrown (range 20/60), and use their versatile damage dice even when wielded with one hand.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add 1d4 crawling claws to the trap. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, halve the number of crawling claws created by the trap.

## B48. Riddle Room

The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open.

Along the western wall of this room is an immense red tapestry, covered in silver and black arcane sigils. The cloth is silk, and in perfect condition as if untouched by the passage of time. On the floor are a series of tiles: white stones, mixed with red bricks and onyx plates. On the south wall is a strange diagram showing the layout of the room.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This room is a complex puzzle requiring the PCs to make some intelligent decisions. In order to reach the tapestry, the PCs must successfully navigate the tiles. 

The diagram on the wall is wrong, designed to encourage interlopers to miss the order in which they stand on the tiles. PCs succeeding at a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check or DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check are able to read the notes and decipher them accordingly.

According to the diagram, the PCs must step on the tiles in the order:

**White, Red, Black, Red, Black, White, Red, Black, Black, White.**

This of course is wrong and only if the PCs succeed at a DC 28 Wisdom (Insight) check or a DC 25 Wisdom (Survival) check can they determine the pattern is illogical and based on their knowledge of traps a trick. While this does not help them determine the actual order they know the diagram is incorrect.

In actuality, it doesn't matter what color they first stand on, but once a tile is touched, only that tile color should be stepped on (by that PC) from that point on. Reaching each stone of that color without touching any other stone requires succeeding a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, unless the PC chose the red bricks which are narrower and require successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throws. If a PC takes the shortest route, they can clear the room in six jumps, reaching the tapestry on the other side. Longer routes take up to ten jumps, but all of them lead to a single 3-ft-wide bronze plate on the floor. The plate, which is below the tapestry is safe for the PCs to stand on, no matter what color tile they chose.

### Encounter Condition
[Poor Footing 3]

### Tactics
If the PCs step on the wrong tile, they suffer a small discharge of energy from the tile based on the color of a tile.

- Stepping on a **red tile** out of turn, reduces the PC's speed by 5 ft. until their next long rest.
- Stepping on a **white tile** out of turn deals 1d4 fire damage.
- Stepping on a **black tile** out of turn poisons the PC unless they succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

### Treasure
Although it radiates no magic of any kind, if the tapestry is pulled from the wall and wrapped around a humanoid, it forms into a **+1 ghostly scale-mail**, which permanently fuses to the wielder's body. It is not uncomfortable, able to be slept in and worn with little issue. Its ghostly nature makes it practically weightless. Anything short of **dispel evil and good** (break enchantment), or the **wish** spell, cannot remove the armor. Despite its weightlessness, it is quite loud and still manages to restrict movement, inflicting all the penalties wearing scale mail would.
