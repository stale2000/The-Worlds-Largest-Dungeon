# Region D (continued)

## D81. Divine Shell

If the PCs somehow enter this room without breaching the adamantine bands, read the following:

> This multi-hued field sparkles with powerful energy, pulsing as beams originating from four statues in the corners feed it.

If the PCs explore this room after the devils break free, read the following:

> A great black pit dominates this room, stinking of brimstone and dung. The walls and the ceiling feature tarnished metal strips. In the corners stand the shattered remains of statues, apparently once depicting angelic heroes. The room is quiet and heavy with tragedy.

## D84. Devils

If the PCs somehow enter this room without breaching the adamantine bands read the following. Otherwise, refer to Room D81 for descriptions of the vault.

> In the center of this vast room is an orb of an utterly dark nature. Clouds of swirling energies dance on its surface, beyond them you can see screaming faces refracted into warped and twisted horrors. Ephemeral hands pound against the walls, and ever so faintly, you think you hear blasphemous mutterings whispering in the air.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This swirling nexus is the border to the Demiplane housing the devils. Inside lurks Kator, and hundreds of other devils, ranging from imps to hellcats and the fearsome horned devils. The only way to release these devils is to destroy the outer adamantine bands and then breach The Devil Vault's interior. The defenses fall like dominoes and release all the imprisoned fiends to destroy the world.

**Encounter Condition:** Cursed 8, Desecration 4, Distracting Noises, Distracting Visions, Echoes 6, Extreme Cold, Extreme Heat, Fear 25, Haunted, Negative Energy, Unhallowed

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** This room is appropriate for PCs of any level, as long as the devils remain inside their prison.

## D85-D103. Northern Mines

Encompassing Rooms D85 through D103, these blighted tunnels are a deadly gauntlet of pestilence, where despite the ravaging plagues wreaking havoc throughout, some mining continues. The traps are aplenty, lying in wait for interlopers who have no business exploring these tunnels. Commanding these mines is a tired and nearly broken formian myrmarch, whose control is tenuous at best. Fighting the plagues ravaging the tunnels has been no small feat and has claimed the lives of countless slaves, derro and formians. Making matters worse, a band of xill have organized and ambush miners, and formian sentries, stall the process for some esoteric purpose.

In a rare meeting between Chtrax and the myrmarch, the xill commanded the myrmarch's forces to construct a bore to assist in the mining process, as the master was dissatisfied with the progress. Furthermore, Chtrax did not intend to reveal this project to the gnome, as it would create undue conflict between the artificer and the master. The command came three weeks ago, before the plagues and xill strikes. Hence, progress on the bore has been slow.

Unlike the other two formian myrmarchs, this one suspects the formian queen is dead at the hands of their master. If the PCs demonstrate evidence of this, and with some smooth talking, the myrmarch throws his lot in with the PCs to defeat the xill overlord. However, if the PCs betray him, he becomes an implacable enemy and hunts the PCs throughout the region.

All rooms here are dark unless otherwise specified. The walls are unworked stone and the ceiling averages 10 ft. in height, while smaller, narrow tunnels are only 5 ft. tall. Bones, trash, metal scrap and spider webs litter all the corridors and rooms, making charging impossible and forcing PCs to succeed a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to run. The air is sulfurous and foul.

### Random Encounters

Check for Random Encounters once each hour the PCs explore this section.

| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | A crack in the floor vents sulfurous fumes, forcing all PCs within 5 ft. to make DC 20 Constitution saves or become nauseated for 1d3 rounds. |
| 2-10 | Nothing |
| 11-13 | 1d4 formian warriors hunt for rogue xill. |
| 14-15 | Two formian warriors astride gorgons, patrolling for xill. |
| 16-17 | 1d6 xill fight over a shackled, screaming duergar slave. |
| 18-19 | 1d3 xill carrying the body of a dead duergar slave. |
| 20 | Tremors shake the corridor, causing fine streams of dust to spill from cracks in the ceiling. |

## D85. Warning

> On the floor, about ten feet inside this wide tunnel is some softly glowing writing scribbled on the floor. The corridor continues ahead into darkness.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The writing is in Undercommon, scribed in ink made from luminescent mold. PCs able to read the writing learn danger lies ahead. The message is a true warning, alerting derro to the russet mold contaminating Room D86.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## D86. Moldy Room

> As you move further down the corridor, it gets colder. When you finally reach the mouth of the cave, you note a brown powdery substance fills the entire room, hanging in strands from floor to ceiling and covering the rocks. In the center of the room lies a gleaming longsword, in the grip of a dead humanoid. The room is exceedingly cold, and your breath puffs out in steam.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** When the waters poured into the tunnels from above, much of it collected here. The resulting moisture and the rotting flesh from the drowned made this an ideal location for various molds. Over time, the water evaporated, leaving a thriving colony of brown mold in its wake. The mold covers this room, so whenever anyone enters a 5 ft. space, they take 3d6 points of damage from each 5 ft. square of mold, for a total of 7d6 points of cold damage.

**Encounter Condition:** Flooded

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The corpse of Ulrad the Unlucky rots in the center of the room, a cursed fighter who found himself lost in the dungeon and finally crawled in here to die. All of his other equipment has long since rotted away, except for his particularly unlucky longsword, a -2 cursed adamantine longsword.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, replace the brown mold with yellow mold. To decrease the challenge, shrink the area of the brown mold to just the central 10-ft.-by-10-ft. section.

---

## D87. More Bodies

> The narrow tunnel extends deep into the rock. Four corpses with large gaping wounds in their chests fill the end of tunnel. Their tools, picks and shovels lie scattered about, rusting. The bodies look like they have been dead for a while.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** These bodies once housed xill eggs, but no longer. Two of the corpses were duergar and the other two were deep dwarves. Their jaws have been removed to prevent *speak with dead* spells.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Aside from a few rusty tools, there is no treasure.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## D88. Tunnel

> Another small tunnel delves into the rock. Scratching noises sound from the darkness.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Three xill hide at the end of the tunnel. Newly emerged from the bodies of three duergar miners, they have just killed the grimlock overseer and are making a meal of his remains. If anyone enters the tunnel, the xill hide in the shadows, waiting for the opportunity to strike.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The xill are merciless combatants. If a lone scout enters the tunnel, two make grab attacks to hold the unfortunate victim steady, while a third tries to inject eggs. Against more opponents, the xill lash out with melee attacks, but keep at least one opponent alive to act as a host.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two more xill. To decrease the challenge, remove one xill.

---

## D89. Chute Trap

For PCs searching for secret doors, or creatures who notice such things, read the following text:

> Something about this empty stretch of wall is suspicious. Perhaps it is the scuff marks on the floor, or the flash of something behind it, but you are certain you spy a secret door here.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Designed to snare the snoops, this secret door is more of a trap than a passage. PCs succeeding at a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check notice scuff marks on the rock surrounding the door, similar to claw marks. The stone door itself is poorly concealed, requiring a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate. The door spins on a horizontal, central spindle, but pushes on a false vertical spindle, so pushing either side of the door causes the top to spin forward, while the bottom lifts the PC up and into the chute beyond. Opening the door is simple. PCs pushing on the door must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity save or tumble to the other side, sliding down the chute to fall in a spectacular splash into the lava below. See lava in this region's introduction for details.

Once in the lava, 1d6 magma mephits attack the PC. The unfortunate PC can swim out of the lava to reach the lip of the chute, taking damage as if immersed each round in the lava. Climbing back up the chute requires a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The magma mephits attack PCs in the lava. They are nearly mindless, so they favor claw attacks over breath weapons. Each round the PC fights the mephits in the lava there is a 20% chance for 1d6 more steam and magma mephits to join the fight.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, double the number of attacking mephits. To decrease the challenge, reduce the Dexterity save DC by -3.

---

## D90. Sounder

> The large tunnel descends into the earth at a sharp angle. At the end of the tunnel, a large six-wheeled wagon carrying a metal cylindrical tank mounted on an iron cradle, with connecting hoses running to another reservoir of sorts hums as a deep dwarf manipulates several levers at the rear of the machine, while another dwarf presses the narrow end of a cone to the wall. Insect men stand guard, evaluating their progress.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** A sounder crew, consisting of two deep dwarves, tests the walls with harmonic resonances to see if they are any closer to the Vault. The sounder crew, if left alone, turns on the device to a narrow beam, mid-pulse with results as described in Room D53. The deep dwarf engineers are sick with cackle fever and frequently stop their detections while they suffer bouts of coughing. Furthermore, the disease has eroded their minds, so they have a 50% chance of switching the sounder up to a high pulse. Three formian warriors stand guard, watchful for xill saboteurs.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The PCs can negotiate with the formians, as the formians count the roaming xill among their enemies. PCs succeeding a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check prevent combat from occurring and the formian warriors request the PCs to accompany them to their myrmarch in Room D93. If the PCs agree, one of the formian warriors leads the PCs there.

PCs interacting with the deep dwarves must succeed DC 16 Constitution saves or catch cackle fever.

If the PCs engage the formians in melee, they fan out to gain flanks where possible and concentrate their attacks on the spellcasters first. The deep dwarves switch up the sounder to a high pulse in the hopes an arc will kill a PC.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the formian warriors' hit points by +20. To decrease the challenge, have the formians start with a Friendly attitude.

---

## D91. Digging Delver

> Astride the back of a huge brown cyclopean slug monster rides a derro dressed in rags. The creature reaches out with its squiggly arms and liquefies the rock it touches. The air is acrid and foul. The mounted derro shrieks with pleasure when he swats his mount with his improvised riding crop.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly/Friendly

**Encounter:** A crazed derro rides atop a delver. Made even more insane by a nasty run of cackle fever, he is perilously close to comatose. With no concern for his actions, he commands the monster beneath him to find the prize at any cost. The delver, eager to find her mate who resides at Room D77, agrees in the hopes she can destroy as much of the region as she can. She tolerates the rider only because it serves her purpose.

If not stopped, the delver cuts a swathe across the dungeon, reaching the lava flow on the other side in 7 days.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the PCs make their presence known to the delver and her rider, the delver stops its digging. The delver is willing to talk with the PCs, but the derro is not. After three rounds of conversation, and if the PCs seem trustworthy, the delver crushes the derro, silencing him.

The delver is interested in any information the PCs have, especially details about what Chtrax's intentions actually are. The delver does not know much, only that a myrmarch controls this section, and the formian workers spend their time constructing a massive drill. Once the PCs have finished speaking, she turns back to her digging, hoping to find her mate.

If the PCs attack, the delver and the rider charge the PCs, intent on destroying them. The delver concentrates her attacks at the armored PCs first, while the derro uses psychic thunderwave to disrupt spellcasters.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, change the Initial Attitude of the delver to Unfriendly. To decrease the challenge, remove the mad derro.

---

## D92. The Bore

> The tunnel slants down and opens into an enormous cave, filled with the din of industrial noise. Muted stone guardians stand at attention, blankly watching the workers toil. Duergar smiths forge the plates that the deep dwarf craftsmen shape into components for the large bore. Other slaves hoist the panels and other parts to the hive of activity, where formian workers labor to assemble a great bore. The cavern echoes the sounds of beating hammers, footfalls, and the occasional shout.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** Inside this half of the enormous cave, 20 formian workers assemble the bore Chtrax commissioned in secret. Ten duergar smiths and their 8 deep dwarf assistants busily melt the metal fragments turned up from the rich iron veins in Rooms D101 and D102. Two stone golems stand ready to attack any intruder that is not a derro, dwarf, or formian taking a hostile action while in this room. Chtrax called for the bore once he lost patience with the gnome artificer Korus' devices. The formian workers do not respond to conversation, though the duergar and deep dwarves direct PCs to Room D93.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Should the PCs fight the inhabitants of this room, the formian workers alert the myrmarch at Room D93, who in turn alerts the rest of the section to the presence of intruders. The stone giants close with the PCs, opening with their slow effect, before pummeling PCs with slam attacks. On the third round, the myrmarch and all the formian warriors from Room D93 join the fight.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add an additional stone golem. To decrease the challenge, remove one stone golem and delay the myrmarch's arrival by 1d3 rounds.

---

## D93. Formian Hive

> Mounds of stone and mud cover half of this large cavern. Several insect men move among the mound conversing, antennae twitching. In the center of these creatures stands a larger and more powerful figure who directs the smaller warriors through practice drills.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** The myrmarch in charge of this section resides here, drilling his troops and honing their abilities to fight against the all-too frequent xill raids. With him are 10 formian warriors and a formian taskmaster with a dominated xill. From the captive xill, the myrmarch learned the xill in this section are conspiring to replace all of the formians, using the slaves as hosts for their eggs. This has fueled this myrmarch's suspicions that all is not well with the queen, and the deal between Chtrax and the formians is nothing more than a ruse. Consequently, the formian has no use for the derro and plots to use the new bore against the Great Hall and disrupt the entire operation.

With the arrival of the PCs, the myrmarch's plans are in jeopardy unless the PCs can convince him they fight the same fight. This requires a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to improve the formian's attitude. If the PCs succeed, the formian explains they served the great Hive Mother, T'chtcheralaz, until the xill master met with her some few months back. The formian myrmarchs received instruction from their leader to follow the commands of the xill as if they were her own. Now, they control the mining operations, truesilver extraction and security throughout the complex.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the PCs enter the room, itching for a fight, they find one. A fight with the formians here draws the attention of the stone golems in Room D92, who arrive to face the PCs on round 3. The formian taskmaster sends the xill to fight the spellcaster PCs, while it tries to dominate the warrior PCs. Meanwhile, the warriors charge into the combat, working to gain flanks where possible, and to separate the PCs from the main body, while the myrmarch employs its spell-like abilities against chaotic PCs. The myrmarch and his minions fight to the death.

If the PCs slay the myrmarch, all formians in this section have disadvantage on all attacks, saves and checks. In addition, they lose access to their hive mind ability.

If the PCs befriend the formians, they can rest and heal here worry-free. The myrmarch refuses to make an assault against the Great Hall until the bore is ready. The formian workers complete the bore on Day 8, far too late to stop the devils from breaking free.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the formian warriors' hit points by +20. To decrease the challenge, delay the stone golem's arrival by 1d4 rounds.

## D94. Abandoned Mine

> Tools, junk and debris fill the end of this hot tunnel. There are no apparent exits, the trash is immobile.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Just as it appears, trash fills this tunnel. The miners originally dug here but stopped when they felt the heat from the lava. Otherwise, this room is empty.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Beneath the pile of broken tools, cast off bits of scrap metal and cloth lies a bone scroll tube, containing a divine scroll of *resurrection*, left here by a derro priest months ago.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## D95. Empty Tunnel

> Loose rock and piles of dust fill this narrow tunnel, before ending some 25 ft. deep.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Xill raids forced the miners to halt work on this tunnel.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## D96. Sentry

> A large insect guard stands watch here, periodically looking into the room behind it and then testing the air with its antennae.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** A formian warrior stands guard here, keeping an eye out for hatching xill eggs, unruly slaves or any other disturbance disrupting the integrity of this section. He redirects any questions posited to him, back to the myrmarch in Room D93.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the PCs attack this guard, it alerts the myrmarch, if it still lives, in Room D93. Thereafter, it fights defensively, until reinforcements arrive. It fights to the death, regardless of whether reinforcements arrive.

The myrmarch sends 1d4 more formian warriors to aid the sentry. These reinforcements, if the PCs did not destroy them in Room D93, arrive in 2 rounds.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a gorgon to this encounter. To decrease the challenge, remove the formian warrior.

---

## D97. Slave Encampment

> This large cavern rivals the one you just came from, but instead of hard-working slaves, you encounter mostly empty bedrolls, laying in neat and organized rows. At one time, this room probably held some 50 or more slaves. Now, just a few dwarves recline, nursing injuries, or stealing a few hours of sleep before they return to work.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** Eight diseased deep dwarf slaves rest here. All have a random disease, as determined by the GM. The dwarves are not interested in conversation, just rest. If the PCs cure a dwarf, they gain an ally for the rest of their time in this region. Otherwise, these dwarves are no threat to the PCs.

**Encounter Condition:** Diseased (any) 20

**Tactics:** Count these dwarves as noncombatants. They do not fight and lack the means to defend themselves.

**Treasure:** The dwarves own nothing but their rags. There is no treasure in this room.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## D98. Debris

> This small niche stinks of refuse. Its purpose is made clear by the hole in the floor.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This place serves as a dump for trash. Every 15 minutes the PCs spend in this room require a DC 18 Constitution save against disease.

**Encounter Condition:** Diseased (devil chills) 20, Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## D99. Graffiti

> The railed track leads down a long and narrow tunnel. About midway down it is a vast painting, a caricature of a red-skinned, horned bug with its finger up its nose.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** In a small act of rebellion, some brave denizen painted a caricature of Chtrax here.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 6

**Tactics:** If the PCs can read dwarven they understand the crude but uninformative graffiti. Otherwise, it looks like a crudely drawn bug with demon horns.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## D100. Sloped Room

> The track ends in a hot light-filled room, emanating warmth from luminescent fungi growing on the walls. The floor steeply descends to two tunnels branching off into the darkness.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Hot geothermal gases formed this unusual cave. The moisture lent an atmosphere hospitable to these harmless and glowing plants. Weeks ago, the miners came across this place and continued to dig deeper into the earth. What they did not realize was the weird atmosphere in this room weakened their immune system, imposing a -4 penalty to all saves against disease. As a result, many of the miners succumbed to an outbreak of disease, spread by poor water and stale air.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** PCs making a lot of noise here may attract the attention of the xill lurking in the tunnels of Rooms D101 and D102. Allow the xill to make Wisdom (Perception) checks opposed by the PCs Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If they succeed, the xill emerge in 1d2 rounds to investigate.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## D101. Mine Tunnel

> This narrow tunnel extends nearly thirty feet before branching into two more tunnels, ending in darkness.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Hidden in the shadows of this tunnel are eight xill. These creatures frequently make raids against the dwarves and formian in Rooms D92 and D93, but between combats, they return here to rest. These xill have designs on taking over the entire region, one section at a time.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the xill hear the PCs in Room D100, or if the PCs enter their tunnels, the xill creep forward as quietly as they can to ambush the PCs. These xill are relatively young and are not very intelligent. They fight to the death, trying to implant as many eggs as they can.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, make one of the xill an 8th-level wizard. To decrease the challenge, remove two xill.

---

## D102. Mine

> This tunnel is as quiet as it is dark. It extends some 30 feet before it branches into two more tunnels ending in darkness.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** These tunnels are empty, cleared by the neighboring xill.

**Encounter Condition:** [Ambush], Echoes 6

**Tactics:** If a Random Encounter occurs here, it gains the benefit of the Ambush Encounter Condition.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## D103. Burial Vault

> The air quickly sours as you round the corner. At the end of the tunnel is a wide room filled with corpses, twitching with vermin. Three odd reptilian creatures spew viscous streams of fluid onto the bodies, causing smoke to rise where the droplets fall.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** When a slave in this section dies, the dwarves carry the corpse to this room to be dissolved by the three digesters. The digesters are always listening for the approach of fresh bodies but have learned not to attack formians or dwarves.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If a formian or dwarf accompanies the PCs, the digesters do not attack. Otherwise, all three digesters turn their acid spray onto the PCs. Afterwards, they charge into melee, attacking the closest PC first. The digesters use their acid spray as often as possible, fighting until they are reduced to 18 hit points or less. They then retreat into the deeper recesses of the cave.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the hit points of the digesters by +20. To decrease the challenge, remove one digester.
