# Region B: A Goblin Empire!

## Overview

Designed unlike other prisons in this dungeon, Region B became known as "the laboratory" where celestials studied prisoners to research the nature of evil and understand how best to keep it in check. While many of the lawful good angels and archons frowned on this practice, the lawful neutral and chaotic good guardians were less reviled. In the end, the angels turned a blind eye to it, and allowed the "harmless" experiments to continue.

Like many areas in the dungeon, this Region is a maze of rooms and hallways. It remained unchanged over the centuries and even followed the chaos of the first earthquake. Though inhabitants fled when wards were dispelled, some occupants remain bloodthirsty. And while the Region did not change as drastically as others had, it did not escape unscathed.

The air is dry, dusty and unmoving, not unlike being in a tomb. PCs walking through these claustrophobic hallways hear strange echoes and moans everywhere, as drafts of hot and cold air cut through the corridors at irregular intervals. It is at once inhospitable and unnerving. Now home to three goblinoid races, as well as various wild beasts, the PCs have more to worry about than mere traps, spooky noises, and unexplainable visions.

The inhabitants of the Region have added to the celestial's magical traps with crude (but effective) traps of their own. Tripwire, scything blades, and pit traps make navigating this Region difficult for low-level PCs. All the while, clever goblinoids hunt the PCs at every turn. If there is one thing the Region is known for, it's this flavor of chaos.

## History

Before the Region's newest visitors arrived, the dungeon contained a distorted hierarchy, where celestials guarded against potential escape from the demons inside and angels stood vigilant against all manner of evil confined within. After the earthquake, all that changed. When the majority of rooms were emptied and the demons inside the remaining cells no longer had any hope of escape, the Region was abandoned. Many celestials lost their lives in the riots that erupted over the centuries that followed and the decision to seal Region N was made.

And while the angels looked away, creatures migrated to Region B, looking for a new home where order was as common as justice.

### The Goblinoid Migration

Goblinoids arrived en masse, digging through whatever hole they could find, following the derro and drow. However, the northernmost reaches of the dungeon had already been "claimed" and the creatures were quickly pushed south. As the years went by, more and more goblins arrived and migration to Region B became easier.

Once they arrived, camps formed quickly and the goblins skirmished with the bugbears and the bugbears warred with the hobgoblins. They returned to their way of life and fights over territory became as common as goblin tribe name changes.

Hundreds of years of warfare lead to the goblinoids trading control like currency. No single force ever stayed in power for more than a generation (and to goblinoids that's more like 8 years) and the condition of the Region is in a state of flux, no matter what the goblin king (Room B75) says.

### The Bugbears

For centuries, the bugbears have fought a two front war against the goblins and hobgoblins, never allying with either and always seeking to route the other races from the Region. Their strength and ferocity easily dominated the goblins in battle and forced the hobgoblins into a remote corner of the region. They learned to use the traps built by the celestials to their own advantage, often luring the less intelligent goblins into them. Only the sheer numbers of goblins and the tactics employed by the hobgoblins prevented the bugbears from totally dominating the Region as the sole goblinoid race.

### The Hobgoblins

The hobgoblins, currently the smallest group of goblinoids in the dungeon, try in vain to assert control over the Region. Their tactics and strategies are sound, but with their number diminished they are never able to claim more than a scant portion of the Region. Once, they ruled the northeastern portion of the dungeon but their rule was cut short by the earthquake. The damage done to their domain was staggering, and their ranks decimated as a result. They were forced back towards the center of the dungeon, where they have been trapped between the goblins and bugbears ever since.

### The Goblins

The goblins, led by their king Sug'kt in recent years, are by far the most numerous race in the Region. Their sheer numbers have allowed them to hold their ground against the bugbears for centuries. Surprisingly, they had few overt clashes with the hobgoblins. The bugbears were a large enough threat that the smaller contingent of hobgoblins often went unnoticed. Over the years a stalemate has emerged, and an uneasy status quo has evolved.

None of the races are content, however. Far from it.

## The New God

Recently, a force like none before arrived to alter the landscape and bring new order to the Region. If you query the goblins, they tell you: a new god has arrived. A statue of his likeness lies to the east and is nothing less than awe-inspiring. The goblins at last have a champion to smite their oppressors.

So great is the power of this faith in Norendithas Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes, that the goblins splintered and even with the goblin king's power, he was unable to unite the fractured tribe. Forming their own brand of culture, the goblins now pay homage to their great god, who graces them with power and terror, promising to rain justice down upon their enemies.

### The Rise of Argliss

Upon hearing news of this new deity the goblin king became enraged. As his kingdom became entranced with the concept of a goblin god, he sensed his power and influence slipping. A close advisor to the king suggested he embrace the new religion.

The king would have none of it.

With Sug'kt set against the new god, his advisors rose up and imprisoned him for heresy. The superstitious guards led the goblin king away and the charismatic advisor, known as Argliss, assumed the throne, proclaiming himself king and the direct messenger of their god. In one fell swoop, he reunited the troubled people and forged a new religion, one that could be used to create whatever laws he chose, through the will of their new god. And while no one noticed, the new king systematically changed the entire goblin culture in a few brief strokes, bending them in the direction of his personal ideals.

Argliss, the new goblin king, was and still is a doppelganger. He wandered into this Region less than a decade ago and was amused by the goblins. Able to hide his form, his brilliant mind made the doppelganger stand out. Soon he became an advisor to the king, and when the opportunity to become more presented itself, he seized it. Despite his brilliant, tactical, and plotting mind, he cannot see all things at once and the truth of this "deity" is not what it seems.

### The Truth of the Statue

In truth, this deity was nothing more than a wayward hunter, turned to stone by a cockatrice (Room C16). Frightened by this unfamiliar creature, the goblin's eyes went wide and he raised his arms over his head in a meager attempt to protect himself. It was in this pose that he was most unfortunately petrified by the cockatrice. Goblins that followed, misinterpreting the stone goblin's fearful expression, concluded that a new and powerful goblin god was looking down on them, demanding their favor and devotion. How else could they explain this awkward statue?

### The Current Situation

While the majority of the goblins follow their new god and king, a sizeable minority have broken off and formed a resistance movement. They continued to follow their old religion and despise the new king for usurping the throne. They are not alone in their opposition to the new regime.

The bugbears found themselves on the receiving end of ferocious attacks and canny strategy soon after Argliss claimed the throne. The new goblin king has struck a pact with the hobgoblins that remain, and now they serve the goblin king as instructors, advisors, and enforcers. Using worgs and howlers as mounts, they've created a fast-attack unit like nothing the goblins could even conceive of. With their new allies and tactics and their new god, the goblins have driven back the bugbears, asserting their control over the majority of the Region. Now the goblins under Argliss fight a two-front war for the first time in their history. The rebel goblins in the south and the bugbears in the north harass and chip away at Argliss' empire bit by bit, using every bit of cunning and trickery at their disposal. For all their bravado however, the zealous goblins under Argliss are firmly in control of the Region.

Dominated by an iron fist, the goblin empire will not (and cannot) be opposed.

## What Else Lives Here

But the Region isn't all goblins and mad religions. In addition to the goblinoids, a number of other beasts call this Region home. Dire wolves, a few undead, and so many traps that the goblins cannot see straight.

More than a few ethereal marauders were trapped in this Region around the time of the earthquake. For the most part they make their home in the northeastern section of the dungeon.

Whether brought in by the celestials to curtail the activities of the goblinoids, or simply here due to the aftermath of the earthquake, this Region is home to a number of blink dogs. They can be found throughout the dungeon, except for in the domain of the goblin king. Here they are hunted as vermin by the goblins. The blink dogs are mainly found in the northern and northeastern sections of the dungeon.

The most unique creature in the dungeon is the goblin king's mount: a yeth hound. How it came to be trapped in this Region is unknown. Shortly after Argliss' rise to power, it arrived and he immediately charged his hobgoblin taskmasters with capturing it and turning it into his personal mount.

While most of the traps were designed to contain and "hold" the inhabitants of the dungeon, some take the form of puzzles that the unwary must solve, lest they suffer at the celestials' hands. And if that weren't enough, Argliss has ordered more traps be made to secure his "kingdom".

Lastly, somewhere in the darkness, a halfling adventurer searches for a powerful artifact that has slipped through the goblin king's grasp.

## The Halfling

Found throughout the Region is a halfling adventurer named Bartleby.

It is very likely the PCs will encounter him long before they find Room B28. If they do, this is the Random Encounter text.

### Bartleby (Random Encounter)

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** Along with the goblinoids and other creatures that inhabit this dungeon, there is a solitary halfling named Bartleby. While the halfling normally is found in Room B28, he is by no means stationary. The PCs have a chance of encountering him anywhere in the dungeon.

How the halfling entered the dungeon is unknown. He is in league with the goblin king and searches for a mysterious artifact of allegedly great power (see sidebar The Artifact). While the goblins know of the halfling, they don't know much. Any attempt to glean information from a captured goblin reveals that a halfling is in the dungeon and that they assist him if he is attacked. Otherwise, they are to leave him alone.

The halfling, Bartleby, is only concerned with his own well-being and his quest for the artifact. He is in league with the goblin king solely to garner the protection of the goblins. Once he finds his artifact he will leave the dungeon, presumably by the way he entered.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush

**Tactics:** Bartleby fights as long as he needs to in order to escape. He knows the dungeon very well and is confident he can lose any attackers as long as he can flee. If the PCs capture him, Bartleby becomes belligerent, hurling insults and curses at the PCs. He does not answer any questions and attempts to escape at the first possible opportunity.

**Treasure:** Aside from his possessions, Bartleby has no other treasure.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter use the improved versions of Bartleby's rogue abilities listed under "Difficulty Increase."

## The Key

During the chaos that resulted in the years following the second earthquake, the celestials sealed off this portion of the dungeon, locking all the doors leading north. None of the doors that lead to Region E can be opened or unlocked without the aid of a key found in Region C (Room C105 to be exact). The celestials entrusted the key to the lantern archon in Region C, who in turn hid it in a room full of false keys.

When this fake key is used to unlock any of the doors leading north, a sonic blast trap is triggered. In addition to the damage caused to the PCs, the sound automatically alerts all creatures in adjacent rooms.

### Thunderous Glyph of Warding Trap

As the incorrect key is inserted, the channels align with the trigger mechanism, setting off a series of ominous clicks and thuds. A magic hum whirrs for only a moment, during which time those who can perceive magic will bear witness to white hot runes searing the area around the lock. Seconds later a thunderous blast rips from the keyhole. Any creature within 5 ft must succeed a **DC 13 Dexterity saving throw** or take **8d4 thunder damage** and be knocked back 10 ft. Creatures that succeed the saving throw take half damage and are not moved.

The trap is ancient, with evocation magic inside only glowing faintly when idle, and invisible without **detect magic**. Succeeding an **Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 15)** gives the player the impression that the lock is suspiciously made, appearing to accept false keys for an unknown purpose.

**Dispel magic** will eliminate the trap, but the door remains locked. After detonating or being dispelled the trap resets in 1d6 minutes.

PCs using the real key are allowed passage to Region E. Use the following encounter for every door that leads to Region F.

## B0. Locked Door

This Encounter is not printed on the Map. Instead, anytime a PC attempts to leave the Region through doors to the north, read the following:

> Before you stands a door. Bound in iron, and standing over 10 ft tall it is unlike any door you've ever seen. The keyhole is a giant griffon head, its mouth agape.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This door is locked and cannot be opened by any means short of the key in Room C105. Any attempt to open it with either the wrong key, a Sleight of Hand, or **knock** triggers a Thunderous Glyph of Warding trap (see above). PCs that attempt to disable or dispel the trap find that it resets itself in 1d6 minutes.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Any attempt to discern the properties of the door gives the impression of heavy amounts of abjuration magic, a complex (almost unbeatable) lock, and a magical trap that triggers when the lock is tampered with. The GM is more than welcome to assign DCs to the checks necessary to learn this information, but it is crucial that they learn it nonetheless. Allow them to spend 30 minutes studying the door.

The door itself is sturdy, made of iron, and with hinges mounted on the other side from where the party is. The PCs should also realize that a key does exist for it (as the tumblers are exact and meticulous) and using the wrong key triggers the trap as well.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** It is not recommended that you increase or decrease the difficulty of this encounter. PCs who persist with this lock are asking for trouble. GMs should not "kill" the PCs with this trap, but instead hint that it can't be bypassed at the moment.

## Some Things to Keep in Mind

The PCs should be 3rd or 4th level when they reach this Section of the dungeon. That means even twelve goblins won't be much trouble.

In order to keep the challenge, the GM should try a few things:

1. **Give your goblins a significant baseline edge.** Throw a standing +4 to their initiative roles because this is their home turf. Add +2 to attacks for the well-defended backline in formation. Throw in some unexpected weapons scavenged by lucky raiders.

2. **Add toughness.** What's wrong with trained goblins having a few extra hit points. It would be worse if you gave them extra levels, right?

3. **Add natural armor.** A +2 or +4 AC bonus makes the goblins tougher but also means that rogues and clerics are going to be less useful.

4. **Aid Another.** With so many goblins, the Help Action really adds up. Don't be afraid to have a few of the goblins extend a helping hand.

5. **Dogpile.** Goblins working together to tackle a dwarf or human barbarian severely weaken a group that's grown too reliant on the 12 points of damage per round 19 Strength, two-handed great greataxe, raging, killing machine. Before the barbarian even thinks of raging, he's on the ground, prone and weaponless.

6. **Give the goblins the benefit of the doubt.** They know the PCs are on the move and they know how to lure them into traps. Triplines across doorways, nearby reinforcements ready to attack from the rear, and signal whistles add up to one memorable encounter.

7. **Limit the PCs' options before they get here.** Spells like **fireball** should be limited at this point in the campaign, so fighting in tight ranks won't hurt the goblins. Don't let a wizard with one spell spoil your adventures. Plan for it. Build around it.

8. **Add a hobgoblin to every encounter.** While not all of them need to be 4th-level fighters, a 1st-level fighter at the back of the ranks, directing the action and throwing alchemical fire or firing a heavy crossbow does more than increase the CR by 1.

9. **Stagger the assaults.** Eventually the barbarian tires out. His rage goes away and another wave of goblins arrive on the final round of his "energy boost." How did that happen?

10. **Add Encounter Conditions that we didn't think of.** Make the room pitch black in a 5 ft radius or add a stench effect (similar to troglodytes) that the goblins are immune to (or used to).

## Goblin Tactics, or 20 Ways to Die

Many of the rooms in this Region resemble one another. This is intentional. Once the goblins descend on the PCs it is most likely they will be fighting wave after wave of reinforcements. And with 25% of the goblin population out patrolling at any given time, a battle in a hallway or room brings the goblins in the adjacent areas down upon the PCs quickly.

And because the goblins have been trained by hobgoblins, they all carry similar weapons and fight with the same tactics. This makes the range of Encounters limited. PCs are likely to get bored after the third room. This is where the GM comes in.

If played out properly, a single goblin Encounter can take up half the evening. By having wave after wave of reinforcements pushing into the room, PCs are likely to tire quickly. Or at the very least, have their patience tested, when the door to the room opens for the fourth time with another wave of twelve goblins. Worse yet, the first three waves are there just to weaken the PCs, using up their magic for the real final battle with Goblinbane.

To complicate matters, should the PCs successfully beat back everything you throw at them, they'll need to find a place to rest and that patrol or scouting party is due back any minute, more than ready to go for help, should they see the PCs standing knee deep in dead goblins. PCs on the run from goblins? Never.

And if word gets back to the goblin king that half his army is dead, a worg cavalry unit and a few hobgoblin bodyguards can be hunting the PCs down in no time flat.

### Additional Tactics (11-20)

11. **Improvise.** Marines don't plan. They adapt. Effective goblin assaults should be no different. If the tactics in this book don't work, change them. Have them shore up a weak point, send in a smaller goblin to aid with flanks, or carry slings in addition to spears to take advantage of the second ranks.

12. **Add cool magical effects.** Give the goblins potions of orc blood (the undercommon version of heroism) allowing them to rage for 3 rounds or gain +2 Strength for 2d6 rounds. Maybe their weapons are coated with a sleep poison or something that just deals 1 point on the following round, enough to make the PCs nervous. "Hey. They've got +1 wounding spears. What gives?"

13. **Make the religion real.** The goblin's faith is stronger than anything and thus they benefit from spells like **guidance** and **shield of faith**, despite the lack of clerics. Heck. Add a 1st-level cleric to each unit. If you don't like clerics, add adepts, druids, or sorcerers with access to a domain spell list or granted power (or both).

14. **Be smart.** Don't let the PC's lure teams of goblins into stupid grease tricks. Anytime the PCs are backing up and don't look injured, trained soldiers know that means trouble. The goblins should hold back, send for reinforcements, and batter the PCs later with some magical assistance or brute strength.

15. **Pace the encounters.** Don't let the PCs charge from room to room wiping out all the goblins before they sound the alarm. Lock or bar a few doors. Make it tough for the PCs to get into the more protected areas.

16. **Give the goblins advantage on all saving throws vs. spell effects.**

17. **Choose your battles.** The goblins don't have to fight the PCs every time. They can lure the PCs out of a room and force them to fight in a confined space, where their larger weapons are useless.

18. **Worgs.** The goblins have dire wolves, howlers, worgs, and yeth hounds at their disposal. Give each goblin unit some firepower with a canine or lupine companion. Perhaps a blink dog was corrupted by the taint of the stables? Perhaps they found a destrachan from Region D?

19. **Drop the anvil.** Once the PCs are out of spells, potions, and wand charges, have the big boys show up and make the PCs rely on wits instead of magic.

20. **Make the PCs work for it.** If the PCs are smart about it, they can decimate the entire goblin army in less than a week, or become another in the long list of victims that have fallen under Haglar's or Hammerfist's boot. No encounter in this dungeon should be "easy." Take the next step and show the PCs what you're made of.

# B1-B48: The Abandoned Halls of the Celestials

Unlike the other Sections of the Region, this initial expanse is not lorded over by any one particular group. The earthquake damaged this section the least, and the celestials that survive in traps and puzzles make the goblinoids wary about settling here.

Blink dogs and dire wolves have taken advantage of the lack of goblinoids in the area, and many dens are scattered throughout these rooms. A few packs of howlers prowl the area, though most howlers live in the Wild Caverns (Rooms B119 through B133).

The celestials used this Section to study and document evil. It was a quiet place for the more scholarly angels to note anything unusual about the evil and unholy beasts they guarded. Several rooms recorded how demons and devils reacted to traps and puzzles.

In general, the air is musty. As few things live here, the odors of life and death are not as prevalent. While the PCs may not have to worry about encountering a staggering number of monsters, they need to keep their wits sharper than their swords. There is a reason the goblinoids merely patrol this Section—the celestials' traps are daunting and difficult to overcome.

## Common Traps in Section B1-B48

### Portcullis Trap

When 15 lbs. of weight are applied to the pressure plate on either side of the arch a portcullis slams down. Creatures underneath are skewered and crushed and must succeed a **Dexterity saving throw (DC 13)** or take **2d8 piercing** and **2d8 bludgeoning damage**. Additionally, creatures that fail to save are pinned underneath, preventing movement until freed. Any creature that can lift 200 lbs. of weight can reliably lift the gate 1 ft off the ground, with the weight requirement doubling for each additional foot of distance desired.

While not subtle, the trap still requires active attention to notice. Once found the plate can simply be stepped over, or disabled by wedging the pressure plate.

The pressure plates are clumsy and obvious, only requiring a **DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check** to spot. Disarming the gate is similarly trivial, only requiring a **DC 12 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check** to pin the plates in place.

They are thin enough for non-small PCs to simply step across. This trap resets only when the **knock** spell is cast on it, which is a preferred method of the celestial caretakers.

### Razor Wire

Difficult to spot (**DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check**) filaments of magically sharpened wire are strung haphazardly across the hallway. Contact with which causes deep cuts and deadly tangling. Each creature caught in the trap receives **1d6 slashing damage** and must succeed a **Dexterity saving throw** or be tangled.

**Tangled** creatures take **1d6 slashing damage** each combat round (or every 6 seconds) and another **1d6** if they attempt to free themselves. A successful **Strength save (DC 11)** frees the affected creature, ending the effect. Other non-trapped creatures may spend an action to attempt to free them, requiring a **DC 10 Strength check** to succeed. On a success or failure, the rescuer receives **1d6 slashing damage**.

Once spotted disarming requires a trivial **DC 8 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check** to sever the wires from the wall. The process is lengthy however, requiring 20 minutes of work to fully clear. Partially cleared (10 minutes of work at least) gives advantage on saves made to resist the trap's effects for potential victims.

### Tripping Chain

Strung across the path is a thin chain. Robust enough to be a tripping hazard, and acting as a setup for a much nastier chain. Both are simple and crudely concealed (**DC 11 Wisdom (Perception)** required to spot). Stepping on the first chain will knock the victim prone unless they pass a **Dexterity or Strength saving throw (DC 12)**, wherein they must make a second **Dexterity saving throw (DC 14)** to take half damage from falling onto the spiked chain.

Creatures that step onto the spiked chain receive **2d8 piercing damage** as the wicked hooks and barbs rend at them. They may also trip from this, requiring the same saves as above but done with advantage this time. Reduce this damage by 1 for every point of AC the creature possesses over 12. Creatures that fall onto the chain receive an additional **1d8 damage** for each size category they are above small (medium +1d8, large +2d8, huge +3d8).

Outside of adverse circumstances small and tiny creatures are not tall enough to fall onto the spiked chain and simply faceplant into the flooring.

Disarming the chains requires the removal of the interlocking pins that keep them taut and tossing them aside. No check is needed once spotted. The mechanism isn't completely intuitive, however. Less mechanically inclined PCs might require a successful **Intelligence (Investigation) (DC 10) check** to understand.

### Burning Hands Trap

Odd pairs of ethereal blue hands dot the walls, their gestures queer to those not in the know. Magically inclined PCs, or those that pass an **Intelligence (Arcana) (DC 13) check** recognize these as somatic spell components frozen in time. The spells they would be casting are diverse and easily recognizable by those who know the spells. A **knock** here, a **commune** there; **goodberry**, **raise dead**, **alter self**. Of the 30 hands present, all save for one are "casting" harmless spells. Any **Intelligence (Investigation) check** by a magic-user should yield the above list as suggestions for the potential spells they might be casting, with **burning hands** added in if they roll a 13 or greater. Should they keep inquiring, simply consult the spell list for more harmless spells to have them "casting." Given enough time and prodding the PCs would stumble across the **burning hands** pair.

Creatures that can see magic will see each hand enchanted with a faint glow corresponding to their assigned spell's school.

Each pair can be permanently dispelled with a **dispel magic** cast (**DC 12**).

If you would like the hands to cast their associated spells go right ahead, but for now, the only pair capable of casting a spell are those forming **burning hands**. Creatures that cross an invisible line from between the fingers of the **burning hands** to the opposite wall trigger the casting. The **burning hands** spell is cast at level 1 targeting the far wall each time the mechanism is triggered, resetting after 6 seconds while the hands perform the gestures to ready it again.

The mechanism cannot be disarmed with physical tools, though a clever rogue might realize it can be simply ducked under or triggered with objects given some experimentation and/or a successful **Intelligence (Investigation) (DC 14) check**.

## The Artifact

> The (doppelganger) goblin king, Argliss, has lost a powerful artifact. At some point during his rise to power over the goblins, the artifact disappeared. While it is not crucial to his reign, he does not wish for it to fall into the hands of his many enemies and rivals to his throne. His new position does not allow him to search, but a halfling, Bartleby, is more than happy to search for the artifact. He has gained the protection of the dominant faction in the Region and enjoys enormous freedom. He has no plans to turn the artifact over to Argliss, however. Anything that powerful is not something you give away lightly. Once he has found the artifact Bartleby plans to leave the Region entirely, using his newfound power as he sees fit.
>
> What the artifact is, however, is strictly up to the GM. It could be something so truly powerful that whoever has possession of it can rule the Region, or it could be a red herring to draw the PCs' attention away from the real dangers in the Region.

### Possible Artifacts

- **Clay Golem Manual.** The ability to craft golems gives the PCs a powerful tool for navigating the dungeon.
- **Medallion of Thoughts.** Reading the thoughts and intentions of the more deceitful denizens the PCs could prove invaluable to their survival.
- **Necklace of Adaptation.** Eventually the PCs will need to cross the Lake (Region L) and being able to breathe underwater might help.
- **Phylactery of Undead Turning.** Useful for the ghouls and wights found in the later rooms of the dungeon.
- **Rod of Cancellation.** The PCs are not the only group in the dungeon using magical items to aid them. The capacity to remove the power of their opponents' items could be key to their survival.

### Possible Locations

- **Room B92, The Maze.** With its constant dangers, placing the artifact in the maze makes for a harrowing quest. Due to the goblin's superstitious fears of the maze, a legend has sprung up about a daring thief who fled with the king's treasure into the maze, only to be punished by Norendithas Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes. The thief in question is eternally trapped in the maze, with the goblin king's treasure lost in its confusing, dangerous confines.

- **Room B111, The Killing Grounds.** Controlled by the undead of the Region, this room is a natural place for the artifact to have been misplaced. Whoever stole it fled here, only to be assaulted by the wights. It could be hiding in plain sight amongst the refuse in the room, or it could have been buried under the dirt floor. Fighting off the ghouls, as well as the dangers of the room itself, presents a unique challenge to any who seek the artifact here.

- **Room B136, Norendithas Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes' Shrine.** Maybe the wayward hunter-turned-deity stole the artifact from the goblin king. If that's the case it has been sealed in the now holy statue. Even Argliss would be hesitant to desecrate the source of his influence over the goblins in an effort to retrieve the artifact. The zealous nature of the goblins that guard the shrine presents unique issues for would-be treasure hunters.

- **Region C.** Perhaps somewhere in Region C, the artifact has slipped through the hands of the goblins and into the clutches of the black dragon, giants, gnolls, or chaotic oozes that roam the corridors.

In the end, these are merely suggestions. The artifact can be anything and anywhere, or nothing and nowhere. It is solely up to the GM how he wishes to run the campaign.

## Room Descriptions

### B1. Entranceway

> This corridor is obviously old, but it is in fairly good shape. The air is musty, and a thin layer of dust coats the area. The walls are plain and free of mold or lichen. It stretches straight ahead for roughly 30 ft. A second hall joins this corridor roughly 10 ft. from the entrance, while the corridor itself turns to the left at the end.

**Encounter:** The hall, while looking nondescript, holds the first of the celestials' traps, as well as a secret entrance to Room B3. A successful **Wisdom (Perception) (DC 15) check** reveals a stone door, flush with the northern wall. The door is trapped. Opening the door triggers the trap; a large double-bit ax head that swings out towards the hallway. Before the door can be fully opened a successful **Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 15) check** is required to unlock it, allowing it to be opened and permitting the party to enter Room B3.

Ten feet into the room, where it meets the second hall, a pressure-triggered trapdoor awaits. It opens into a 10-ft-wide-by-20-ft deep pit filled with several sharpened spikes. It is triggered as soon as someone steps on the stone floor. Springs hidden under the trapdoor reset the trap once it is triggered. A **Wisdom (Perception) check** with a roll of 15 or greater alerts the PC's that the floor above the pit has a thinner layer of dust than the surrounding area. See below for full trap rules.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the difficulty of this encounter, double the depth of the pit and roll 5d10 for the ax-trap instead of 2d20. To reduce the difficulty, double the amount of temporary hit points granted to players caught in the pit trap.

#### Scything Blade Trap (Door Mounted)

When pried open the door easily allows one inch of clearance. Doing so reveals the keyhole and arms the spring-loaded ax. A specific key, which might be found on someone important, will disarm the mechanism and open the lock. Otherwise, simply picking the lock is doable, but results in the door flying free on spring-loaded hinges with the ax scything into the hallway. Creatures within 5 ft. of the door must succeed two separate **Dexterity saving throws (DC 13)**.

The first save avoids the swinging door and allows them to stay in place. Creatures that fail this save take **1d8 bludgeoning damage**, knocking the creature back 5 ft in any direction, out of the way of the axe. If there is no room for the creature they are hit and knocked prone instead.

Standing, Medium-sized creatures and above that remain within 5 ft of the trap after the door springs open must succeed their second save or be struck by the swinging ax. Pick the first to be struck and roll 2d20. Subtract that target's AC from the amount, and deal that much slashing damage to them. If more than zero damage is dealt, perform this again for each creature in line to be struck using the remaining damage instead of the initial roll for each subsequent hit. (e.g., GM rolls a 24, the first creature struck has 13 AC, they take 11 damage. The ax swings through, hitting the next creature who has 10 AC, which reduces the remaining 11 damage they would take down to 1, continuing until zero).

To disarm the trap the door must remain locked and opened as much as it allows. The mechanism can be tripped from the inside with a **DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check**. As the guide pins pop loose the axe slams loudly into the closed door before the stress on the mechanism ruptures its hinges and it clanks worthlessly against the floor.

#### Spiked Pit Trap

When 15 lbs. or more of weight are applied to the 10 ft. wide trap door panel the clutch releases, dropping the section on a hinge and plunging any creature atop it into a 20-ft pit. A feat of **Dexterity (Acrobatics)** or **Strength (Athletics)** would be required to mitigate the ensuing skewering on the spikes below. Creatures will choose which skill to use, and roll the check as normal. The resulting roll is gained as temporary hit points (representing their heroic attempts to grapple with the pit walls and dodge the spikes), before they take **3d10 piercing damage**, in addition to fall damage.

These temporary hit points are lost when they exit the pit and stack with other sources of temporary hit points.

Disabling the trigger requires crossing to the far side (a 10 ft, jump) and wedging the hinge with something sturdy, which requires a **DC 7 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)**.

### B2. Abandoned Guard Post

> This room is long and narrow. Toppled benches and tables lie in disarray throughout the space. Weapon racks stand empty in the western corner. Whoever used this room has long since deserted it. The dust is thicker in here than in previous rooms and you kick it up into the air with every step. Several burnt-out torches lie on the floor as well and the air has a slightly smoky quality to it. Strange carvings line the back wall, and an aged leather hide hangs on the eastern wall.

A secret door in the southeast corner can be discovered by a successful **Wisdom (Perception) (DC 15) check**. The door's lock is jammed and requires a successful **Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 15) check** to open. The door leads to Room B4.

**Encounter Condition:** Haunted

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Wedged between two stones in the corner of the room is a small tarnished and chipped silver dagger. It can be found by PCs who roll a 15+ on **Wisdom (Perception) checks** while examining the room.

**Scaling:** N/A

### B3. Observatory

> The ax swings lazily in the doorway. Stepping around it you enter a stark chamber. Along the western wall is a table and chair, both built of stone. Along the northern wall rests a large bookcase. Only a few ancient leather-bound books remain on its shelves. Aside from these few furnishings, the chamber is empty.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room was built to observe the demonic and devilish prisons of this Region. The celestials crafted it to be as unobtrusive as possible. From here they could freely observe the unholy hordes closely. It has been abandoned for quite some time.

The leather books remaining are quite fragile. Unless the PCs are incredibly careful, the pages crumble when handled. Unless one of the PCs is fluent in Celestial, the text requires a successful **Wisdom (Insight) check (DC 18)** to translate. Even if a PC understands Celestial, the text is in such disarray, that another successful **Insight check (DC 15)** to translate is required to make sense of it.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The few remaining journals, if deciphered, give the PCs a broad sense of the previous inhabitants in this dungeon. They primarily detail the demons and devils that were here 2,000 years ago. If this is the first the PCs have learned of the purpose of the dungeon, allow each person reading the tome a single question.

**Scaling:** N/A

### B4. Secret Armory

> The door slides inward, creaking loudly on rusty hinges. The interior is dark, but it is not impossible to see into the room. The walls are lined with racks and racks of simple weapons: spears, clubs, and slings. The spearheads are dull, but the dry air has prevented them from rusting. Two large barrels towards the back of the chamber are filled with small rocks, obviously ammunition for the slings. Someone is obviously stockpiling weapons for a prolonged conflict, and they might be back soon.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The bugbears that were formerly stationed in Room B2 kept their weapons in this hidden storage room. The weapons are crude and even a layman can tell they were hastily built.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The room contains two dozen javelins. They are of inferior quality, but not to the point which causes any meaningful trouble. The two barrels, combined, hold roughly 170 lbs. of gravel suitable for use as bullets for the three dozen slings contained in the armory. The dozen clubs found here are not discernable in any way from other clubs.

**Scaling:** N/A

### B5. Trap Room

As the PCs approach the door to Room B5, read the following.

> The corridor wraps around a square structure in the center of this room. As you walk around it you notice a large stone door set in the center of the wall's western side. The stone of the door is slightly darker than the walls and is carved with various indecipherable runes.

The door to this room is trapped.

#### Falling Stone Trap

The trigger to the falling stone trap is embedded in the handle of the stone door. Attempting to open the stone door by grasping the handle causes the handle to pull outwards while the door remains shut. After an ominous click an enchanted slab of stone, pocked by time and use, silently falls. Its immense weight slams into anything within 10 feet of the door. Creatures must make a **Dexterity (DC 14) saving throw** or take **4d8 bludgeoning damage** as they are caught underneath. Objects cannot make this save, and take double damage. Any that succeed are pushed to the edge of the falling block as they scramble out of the way. After ten seconds the block raises and resets. Opening the door by prying the gap safely avoids the crushing. While the door is open the trap will not trigger so as to not damage the door itself.

When the PCs enter the room, read the following.

> The room is large and empty apart from a pedestal resting against the far wall. The floor is tiled in dark granite, with a line of polished white marble leading from the door to the pedestal. Upon the pedestal, there is a golden idol embedded with two emerald gems for eyes and a pearl set in its belly.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This is a particularly difficult encounter and if the PCs are smart, they will leave before it escalates.

The celestials that occupied Room B3 designed this room to test the intelligence of the prisoners. It contains a series of three traps, each slightly more advanced and deadly than the next. The room itself is 30 ft. wide by 40 ft long.

The first test is the door to the room. This is the most straightforward of the traps.

The second trap is built into the floor of the room. The floor tiles are the key to this trap. Each tile is 2-ft-by-2-ft. The obvious path is straight down the middle, following the white marble. Of course any path that obvious must be a trap. The celestials took this into account. To circumvent this trap the PCs must travel down, staying on either side of the path, walking a thin line. The white and black tiles nearest each other represent the only safe paths to the pedestal. The PCs must stay within the 4-ft. wide path created by the joined black and white tiles. If they stray to either side of these paths, the trap triggers, raining metal shards and caltrops on the occupants of the room from concealed slots in the ceiling.

A successful **Wisdom (Perception) (DC 12) check** reveals the paths are slightly more worn than the surrounding tiles while a roll of 16+ reveals the nature of the trap.

If the PCs can make it to the idol, they must circumvent a third trap to claim the prize. This is a simple pressure plate under the idol. If the PCs do not disable it before they remove the idol, the plate triggers spring-loaded poisoned darts hidden behind the eastern wall. Once the PCs have the idol they can safely leave the room.

#### Raining Shards

When the appropriate tile is depressed by more than 10 lbs. of force the room-wide trap triggers. Slots in the ceiling drop metal blades onto every inch of the space beneath them. No amount of dodging can save those caught in the gale of sharpened metal. Creatures within the room take **4d10 slashing damage**, minus the victim's AC (minimum zero), and an additional **2d10** if they are not wearing any head-covering.

Creatures with shields have resistance to the damage dealt by this trap.

If a creature is within 5 ft. of another that is at least a size larger than them they can attempt a **Dexterity saving throw (DC 14)** to halve the damage. This trap fires once per room reset.

#### Spring-loaded Darts

When half the idol's weight is added to or removed from the pedestal a spray of darts snap across the room. Starting from the east wall any creature not completely obscured by another must succeed a **Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw** or take **2d8 piercing damage** and be **poisoned** until their next long rest.

The trap-holes can be found with a **DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check**, and disabled with a further **DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)**. Undoing this mechanism leaves the darts open for the taking. The first time a dart deals damage it loses its poison and poisons the target if they fail a **Constitution (DC 14) save**.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** As soon as the idol passes beyond the doorway it instantly turns to dust, the traps reset, and the door closes. This was the final test the celestials had—to determine if demons would continually pursue a futile goal.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, upgrade the spring-loaded darts trap to a fusillade of spears trap, increasing the damage dice to d12s. To decrease the challenge, reduce the damage of the raining shards trap to 6d4.

### B6. Hall of Mirrors

> The floor and walls of this large room are covered in mirrors. As soon as you enter, a stone door slams down from the ceiling, sealing the entrance behind you.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is a single huge trap. With every surface covered in mirrors, it is impossible to find a way out. The door the PCs entered through is sealed and is no longer an exit. Only by finding the trap's trigger and disabling it are the PCs able to leave this room. If they cannot, they are trapped here until they expire. The trigger is located in the northwestern corner, near the floor. A hairline crack (**DC 14 Wisdom (Perception)** or **Intelligence (Investigation) check** to spot) in a mirror is the only hint the PCs have to the trigger's location. The crack is actually the edge of a removable panel that reveals the trigger. Succeeding a **Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (DC 14)** flips the switch and swings all four doors open.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase all of the DCs for the hall of mirrors trap by +2. To decrease the challenge, decrease the DCs by -3 or merely have the door open after 24 hours.

### B7. Waterfall

> This room is rough in appearance. The walls are pitted and uneven, as if acid vapor eroded the finish. The floor is covered in discs, each two ft. in diameter. The discs sit higher than the floor and wobble slightly.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The discs in this room are the key to the PCs successfully navigating their way across it. They are designed to shift and are each mounted on a compact spring. The PCs must carefully make their way across the room, which requires a successful **Strength (Athletics)** or **Dexterity (Acrobatics) (DC 13) check**. If the PCs stumble, or in any way touch the floor under the discs, the trap triggers. The doors to the room seal and torrents of water gush into the room from slots near the ceiling. The water pours in from both the east and west walls. The PCs have two minutes to disarm the trap or they drown. The release for the trap is located on the center of the middle wall requiring a **DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception) check** to spot, and requires a successful **Strength (Athletics) check (DC 12)** to pull. Once the trap is disabled the water drains through grates under the discs and both doors to this room.

**Encounter Condition:** Extreme Cold, [Flooded]

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the difficulty of the encounter, players make the **Strength (Athletics) check** at disadvantage when the timer reaches 1 minute remaining as the water impedes their attempts to pull it. To decrease the difficulty, reduce the DCs to spot the lever by 5.

### B8. Gold Mine

> The walls of this room are flecked with gold. The roughly square room is filled with mounds of dirt and rubble. Crude picks, shovels, and the bones of several small goblinoids lay scattered on the ground. The gold flecks glow and entice you forward.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room, while clearly attractive to greedy PCs, is as much a trap as anything else in the Region. Touching the gold flecks releases poison gas into the room. As the door seals them in, the PCs have little choice but to disable the trap to survive. As long as the PCs do not touch the gold flecks, the trap does not trigger. There are no flecks on the floor at all.

If the PCs trigger the trap, they have to act swiftly to turn it off.

In the middle of the room is a squat stalagmite. A successful **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception) (DC 15)** reveals a series of three knobby buttons. To disable the trap and open the door they must be pressed in the correct sequence. One attempt may be performed by the PCs each round. Each attempt they will roll 3 separate **Intelligence (Investigation) checks (DC 15)**. Make note of each success and failure as a score.

When 3 failures have been noted across multiple attempts, reset the scores and start anew. When 3 successes are recorded the PCs have found the correct sequence, the trap disarms, and the door opens. If a tie occurs (both hit 3 simultaneously) the state with any extra score wins. In the case of a perfect tie, reset the round as if they had failed, but have the PCs start with one success going into the new attempt.

After 24 seconds from the initial triggering the gas will start to leave lasting harm. Creatures caught in the room must succeed a **Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + rounds elapsed)** or take **1d6 poison damage** for each time they've failed this save.

**Encounter Condition:** [Smoke]

**Tactics:** Once the trap is disarmed (or if it was never triggered), the PCs who make **Wisdom (Perception)** or **Intelligence (Investigation) checks** with a roll of 17+ notice the transparent outline of angel wings on the back wall. Faint and depressed, these grooves are used to open the secret door leading to Room B13. If a PC you feel would be deemed "good" by the virtue locks used by the celestials touches the grooves by laying their palms flat, the wall rises up and remains open for 5 rounds. The secret door cannot be opened from the other side.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, replace the poison gas trap with an insanity mist vapor trap. Creatures that fail their **Constitution saving throw** must move toward and take an attack action against the nearest creature on their next turn, instead of receiving poison damage. To decrease the challenge, reduce the poison damage to a d4 or even a d2.

### B9. Dire Wolf Den

As the PCs approach the room, read the following.

> As you make your way down the hall, you hear heavy breathing coming from behind the door up ahead. The air is dank with a discernible odor as if something were living here.

Once the door is open, read the following.

> Your torches have trouble cutting through the darkness in the room. All that you smell is a dank odor that clings to everything. From the shadows a pair of large wolves rush out, fighting—nipping at each other's heels. Their hackles are raised as they would be when fighting for dominance. Turning and snapping, the two creatures snarl and lunge, attacking wildly.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** The PCs have stumbled onto a pair of dire wolves that were trapped in this room. They have been quarreling for some time, but now happily have something new to dominate. They attack the PCs on sight, fighting to the death if necessary.

If no one holds the door open, it slams behind the PCs. From the inside, the door is locked and requires a successful **Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)** or **Strength (Athletics) (DC 17) check** to escape. The other two doors are not locked, however.

**Encounter Condition:** Concealment, Deep Darkness, Fearless, [Stagnant Air]

**Tactics:** Light in this room is reduced to a 5 ft. radius, no matter how powerful the source. This puts PCs without darkvision at a major disadvantage.

The dire wolves have been trapped here for weeks, but do not fight as cohesively as pack animals normally do. They do not flank or aid one another or use any tactics to gain an advantage over an opponent. Instead, they simply choose a target and focus their energies solely on them.

If the PCs stumble around in the dark, they can find the carcasses of four other wolves littered here. Apparently, they turned on each other once they were trapped in this room. The two that survived were the largest and the strongest.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two dire wolves. To decrease the challenge, reduce their hit points by -15 each.

---

### B10. Bugbear Refuge

As the PCs approach the room, read the following.

> A splintered wooden door blocks the entrance to this room. From behind it, you can hear a quarrel in a foul tongue. Something yells and a loud crash reverberates through the halls.

Removing the splintered wooden door without making a noise requires succeeding a **Dexterity (Stealth) check (DC 12 + Bugbear's Perception modifier)**. A **DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check** is also required to carefully move the door without scraping it against the stone walls.

If the PCs remain in the hallway for more than 10 turns, have the PCs all make **Dexterity (Stealth) checks**. Then, roll a **Wisdom (Perception) check** for the Bugbear, using the lowest **Dexterity (Stealth) check** result as the DC.

If the PCs make a noise in the hall that a bugbear notices, the arguing coming from inside the room stops immediately. The bugbears take defensive positions behind makeshift cover and prepare to ambush the PCs as soon as one of the doors is pushed ajar.

If the PCs enter without being noticed, read the following.

> Three furry goblinoids point and shout at one another, obviously engaged in a heated debate. The creatures are muscular and brutish, each standing about seven feet tall. Coarse hair covers their bodies and chipped and crooked fangs protrude from their snarling mouths. The largest spits as he screams at the smallest, who apparently isn't backing down.
>
> All around the room, debris and broken wood obscure the stone floor.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Three bugbears have made this room their refuge, but have been unable to leave for two weeks because of the dire wolves in Room B9. They are stir-crazy now and arguing with each other (in Common) about who cheated at a dice game that obviously isn't being played.

If surprised, allow the middle bugbear a **DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check** to notice someone entering. The largest and smallest bugbears are automatically surprised if the PCs enter without making any noise.

**Encounter Condition:** [Ambush], [Cover], Echoes 3, Poor Footing 2

**Tactics:** If an encounter takes place in the room, the bugbears swarm the nearest PC, taking a defensive position until they have a handle on the situation. If the leader drops to zero hit points, flip a coin. Heads, the other two surrender. Tails, they become enraged (Barbarian **rage** feature, as if they were level 3s).

If the encounter takes place in the hall two bugbears engage the PCs, forcing them away from the entrance to the room, while the smallest runs around to the other side of the corridor, to wedge the PCs in.

**Treasure:** Hidden under the debris in this room is a small strongbox (**Intelligence (Investigation) check, DC 18** to locate). The lock is simple and crude, but gummed up with grime, requiring a successful **DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check** to unlock, or **DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check** to smash the faulty mechanism and pry the box open. When the strongbox is opened, a thin wire running along the hinge pushes down, cracking a vial of acid hidden inside the box. The bugbears normally open the box slowly, preventing the glass from shattering. Allow the PC a **Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 18)**. If they succeed, they hear metal scratching against glass and are allowed a **DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check** to stop opening the box before rupturing the vial. If the PC makes no intimation that they are opening the box slowly, do not allow any checks.

If the vial cracks (which is automatic if the rolls fail or the PC is hurried), an alchemical reaction occurs and the acid inside, reacting with the surrounding air, becomes a fog that blankets a 5 ft. square in front of the strongbox. This lasts for 1 minute and any creature starting their turn, ending their turn, or moving through the cloud receives **2d6 acid damage**.

Inside the chest are **46 sp, 24 gp**, a dull pearl set into a gaudy necklace (25 gp), three **healing potions**, and a **wand of light** (spend an action to cast the **light** spell without any components, doing so costs 1 charge, wand is found with 2d12 charges remaining).

The largest bugbear keeps three keys on a ring on his belt. The first key goes to the strongbox in this room. The second is for the locked door leading to Room B12. The third is to the inside of the door in Room B9.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one bugbear. To decrease the challenge, remove one. These bugbears are considered the middle bugbear for the purposes of tactics and the encounter.
