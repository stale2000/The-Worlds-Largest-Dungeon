# Region D (continued)

## D46. Formian Barracks

This long, low-slung structure is made of stone worked in honeycomb patterns. The structure is immaculate, the ground around the place smooth and level, adorned with line patterns on the floor extending outward away from the building some 10 ft. Round portals offer access to the building's dark interior.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A or Indifferent

**Encounter:** This unusual building, designed by its occupants, serves as the formian barracks. Though outsiders do not need to sleep, formians function better with a place to collect their thoughts between shifts. The barracks are in effect eight different cells. Each cell is bare, except for a conical mound in the center where a small orb of granite rests. The formians focus their thoughts on the perfect sphere as a means to maintain perfectly ordered thoughts. Complex line patterns cover the walls and floors, leading through the patterns to the mounted spheres.

Presently, the barracks are empty, giving the PCs a chance to rest, stage an ambush, or investigate their enemy. After 30 minutes roll for a Random Encounter.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, the Great Hall continues as normal, except there is a 15% chance any given room has its numbers halved. In addition, the loss to the formian workers increases the number of days needed to repair a damaged or destroyed building by 1d3.

**Treasure:** Each room houses a perfect sphere of granite. The craftsmanship, not the material, makes these 10-lb. spheres valuable. There are eight spheres, each worth 20 gp.

**Scaling:** N/A

## D47. Corral of the Beast Handlers

The gate to the corral is locked, requiring a DC 25 Dexterity check to unlock it; the beast handler at Room D37 has the key. Inside the gate, the monsters all wander about the open area. A large trough of semi-clean water sits at one end. The monsters here are beyond caring and have little fight left in them. They are fatigued, and only fight if attacked. [A fatigued PC can neither run nor charge and takes a -2 penalty on Strength and Dexterity checks.] They fight to the death, battling mostly in defense and not working together.

A 9-ft.-tall wall of stone corrals this place. From inside, you hear growling and roaring, the crunching of bones and other disturbing sounds associated with feasting. Guarding the gate on the side facing the great drill are three formian warriors holding halberds. Behind them, you clearly see a collection of fearsome monsters, including a bulette, a couple of digesters and even a destrachan.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** Three elite formian warriors guard the corral to ensure no one tampers with the beasts. Inside, there is one bulette, one destrachan, and two digesters. The formians are watchful. If the PCs approach, and the formians are not on alert, one of the formian warriors demands to know the PCs' business. The PCs must succeed a DC 25 Charisma (Deception) check to prevent the formians from attacking. If the encounter turns to combat, the formian warriors alert the rest of the Great Hall with their Hive Mind ability before attacking. The monsters are all fatigued from their work in the Great Hall and are not interested in fighting unless provoked. If the PCs keep out of the corral, the monsters ignore them.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** After combat starts, 1d2 more formian warriors arrive every 1d4 rounds until a total of two more have arrived. On the round after the last formian warrior arrives to reinforce the guards, the formian myrmarch from Room D39 arrives.

The formian warriors let the PCs come to them rather than charging into the thick of the battle. Reinforcements surprise attack the PCs from the rear. Even if the desperation of the fight escalates, the formian warriors do not draw the monsters inside the corral into the fight.

If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, all surviving monsters escape and head in random directions to kill as many formians and derro as possible.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, remove the fatigued condition from the monsters inside the corral and have them attack. To decrease the challenge, replace the elite formian warriors with standard formian warriors.

## D48. Headquarters

As the PCs approach this room read the following text:

> Clearly, this structure is new and imposing when compared to the other buildings in this massive gallery. Blending alien architecture with the grim utilitarian features characteristic of this region, it sports fluted columns, odd and apparently useless spinning gears, all incorporated in an intricate stone pattern. The building is windowless and has a single entrance: a purple-steel-crystal-trapezoid-shaped door.

If the PCs enter, read the following text:

> Beyond the glowing door is a foyer of sorts, extending 10 ft. to either side and ahead about 12 ft. The room is barren both of furnishings and decor, except for a puce-colored disk inset at the center of the room. A single door of the same material and shape as the one you just entered stands closed in the center of each wall.

Consult the Great Hall introduction for details on Chtrax's placement in this section.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is the entrance to Chtrax's most private sanctum and headquarters. When a petitioner wishes to speak with the xill master, they know to stand on the circle, call to their master and state the purpose of their visit. If Chtrax is not present or does not wish to address the petitioner, he ignores them. The derro and formians know to leave if they do not hear a response within a minute.

To prevent unwanted intrusions and to command fear and respect from his minions, Chtrax warded all of the doors leading to the inner sanctum with terrible traps. If Chtrax agrees to speak with the petitioner, he deactivates the traps from inside Room D49 and opens the central door. Otherwise, PCs or foolish servants attempting to reach the inner sanctum must contend with the nasty devices protecting the xill.

All three interior doors and the speaking circle detect as magical.

### Traps

**Door Trap of Fireball**
- **Detect:** DC 25 Wisdom (Perception)
- **Disable:** DC 25 Dexterity
- **Effect:** Triggering the trap releases a *fireball* spell upon the characters, who will need to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

**Door Trap of Polymorph**
- **Detect:** DC 25 Wisdom (Perception)
- **Disable:** DC 25 Dexterity
- **Effect:** Triggering the trap releases a *polymorph* spell upon the characters, who will need to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to resist or be turned into a peacock.

**Door Trap of Cloudkill**
- **Detect:** DC 25 Wisdom (Perception)
- **Disable:** DC 25 Dexterity
- **Effect:** Triggering the trap releases a *cloudkill* spell upon the characters, who will need to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to resist.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A; However, if Chtrax is present in Room D49, he readies for combat if one of the traps trigger or a PC stands on the speaking circle and says nothing. If afforded the time, he grabs the phylactery and hides. See Room D49 for more details.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, replace all three traps with *wail of the banshee* traps (DC 15 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points; on a success, suffer 10d6 psychic damage). To decrease the challenge, change all the door traps to the following: *cloudkill* trap (right), *chain lightning* trap (center), and *black tentacles* trap (left).

## D49. Inner Sanctum

The stink of this enormous hall is overpowering. Overhead hang globes of purplish light casting obscure shadows on the walls. Filling the room are innumerable tables holding twitching, barely conscious derro, duergar and deep dwarves. Given their supine positions and distended abdomens, it is clear something is gestating inside them. Sprays of reddish-brown liquid stain the walls and ceiling, while the floor is black and sticky.

If the PCs enter through the center door, or round one of the corners, read the following text if Chtrax is not present:

> In the center of the chamber, upon a dais, stands a silver tripod holding a 1-cubic-ft. box of some silvery metal, encrusted with gems, etched with runes, and flickering with unfathomable intelligence.

If Chtrax is present, read the following text instead:

> In the center of the chamber and upon a dais stands an empty silver tripod.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A or Hostile

**Encounter:** This room is a testimony to the depths of Chtrax's fathomless evil. To replace the substandard derro, Chtrax breeds his own here. Summoning an occasional derro or dwarf to receive a reward for their labors and wisdom, Chtrax injects an egg inside the host. Some he releases back into the mines – others, especially the dangerous ones, he keeps locked up here.

Amid the developing wombs, Chtrax plots his course, tracking the progress of his tunneling, the truesilver extraction and the birth rate of his spawn. He also keeps the formian queen's phylactery here, in proximity so he can maintain the hive mind.

If Chtrax is present and aware of the PCs approach, the protection of the phylactery is of paramount importance. He snatches the phylactery from its stand and casts as many spells as he can before the PCs enter.

Chtrax uses *cloudkill* to control the terrain of the encounter. If he has the chance, he uses *animate dead* to provide a distraction, as combining zombie troops with *cloudkill* is a lethal combination, since zombies are immune to the poison. Chtrax saves his *polymorph* for opposing spellcasters, preferring to change them into peacocks. If an encounter turns against him, Chtrax does not hesitate to flee. He never forfeits his life for mere formians. If prevented from fleeing, he uses his offensive spells, using his staff of fire if necessary.

If Chtrax dies, the phylactery vanishes, freeing the formians from the xill's hold and having results as described in this region's Introduction. However, the digging continues. The tarrasque, driven by the commands of the derro savant controlling it, continues to press forward unless somehow stopped. On the other hand, the tunnels descend into bloody death traps, with formians killing derros and dwarves, stone giants attacking the derro, and the bulette and other monsters rampaging. All truesilver extraction halts, and the gnome in Room D53 ceases production of the mining equipment and emerges to seize control over Rooms D57 to D61. If the PCs do not stop the tarrasque, the devils break free on schedule and sweep through the tunnels bent on genocide.

If the PCs or tremors destroy this room and Room D48, check to see if Chtrax was present. If he was, he escapes with the phylactery to Room D61, where he remains until Day 7. If he was not present, the destruction of the building destroys the phylactery and the formians act as described above.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If present, and allowed time to prepare, he casts the following spells in order: *expeditious retreat*, *stoneskin*, and *greater invisibility*. When the PCs enter the room, he then casts *cone of cold*, targeting as many PCs as he can. On the following round, he flees, alerting the entire Great Hall. If combat becomes unavoidable, Chtrax strikes from surprise, using *greater invisibility*, *spider climb* and *haste* to first observe his foe and then strike from unexpected angles.

All surviving unattached elite formian warriors arrive on round 3 and 1d6 formian warriors arrive every 2 rounds after, until all surviving members of the 30 unattached formians arrive. Finally, in five rounds, the formian myrmarch arrives to aid his leader. Chtrax takes any opportunity he can to escape, fleeing to Room D61, where he remains until the tarrasque breaches the vault.

**Treasure:** Hidden beneath one of the tables is Chtrax's journal and notes, written in Infernal. Players able to translate the book learn all the details in this region's Introduction, including details on Asrakhor the Undying, the devil vault and Chtrax's nefarious plan.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase Chtrax's hit points by 30. To decrease the challenge, remove Chtrax from this room.

## D50. Ruined Building

The shattered ceiling collapsed here, with nothing remaining of this building aside from a few broken walls, bones and rubble.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This building was a storage facility, but tremors collapsed part of the ceiling causing it to fall and destroy the contents. This building serves to clue your players about the Great Hall's instability. If the PCs make a frontal assault, allow them to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to catch sight of this ruined building before they recklessly engage the formians. Of course, if they do not see the clue for what it is, let them die.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## D51. Silver Track

A line of track runs on the floor from a circular building to a large exit.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A or Indifferent

**Encounter:** Two stone giants push an ore cart laden with truesilver from Room D41 to Room D53. It takes one minute to move the ore cart from Transportation and Inventory (D52) to reach the Gnome's Workshop. There, it takes three minutes to unload them, and then eight minutes to return. The giants then work at the bore or return to their lair in Room D27. Typically, the giants make 1d3 trips per day, and there is always at least 1d6 hours between each trip. Therefore, there is a 30% chance the giants are at a random point, somewhere on the track.

The giants hate their work and are thus both slow and slothful. Should they encounter the PCs, they are indifferent and depending on the PCs' attitudes, may or may not let them go about their business. Confronted with well-armed and dangerous opponents, the stone giants ignore them and go about their business. On the other hand, if the PCs are weak, the giants attack them.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Should combat occur, the giants attack to kill the PCs quickly and efficiently by pummeling them with slam attacks. If combat turns against them, they call out for help. If they start calling, roll for Random Encounters to see what happens or who comes to investigate. The giants will flee if one falls below 50 hit points.

**Treasure:** If the giants head toward the Gnome's Workshop (Room D53), then their cart holds 1d6 × 10 1-lb. bars of truesilver. Each bar is worth 750 gp, but if touched by a mortal, the metal transmutes to normal silver, reducing the bars' value to 5 gp.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, give each giant a single-use Action Surge. To decrease the challenge, remove one giant.

---

## D52. Tunnel and Intersection

Following the rail, you travel down the wide tunnel. Words of encouragement, praises to the Master, and solemn reminders of duty echo in your ears. The exhortations continue from invisible mouths until you reach an intersection, where an enormous statue of a multi-armed demon stands proudly, with one hand on the head of an adoring derro servant, another hand on the shoulder of a proud formian warrior, with dwarves and derro groveling at his feet. The dark corridor grows brighter with flickering light to the right and sounds of deep rumbling and tools working away stone from the left.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** A permanent *wall of force* protects this statue. Chtrax believes it to be a symbol of inspiration for the derro and the slaves, and it pleases him to walk by it. There is a 5% chance Chtrax (Room D49) is here admiring his features.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## D53. Laboratory

The tunnel opens into a large cave with multicolored walls, pieces of flowstone near the high, 30-ft.-tall ceiling with attached stone draperies. Crystal coral and gypsum flowers cover the floor, reflecting the light and presenting a dazzling scenario. Marring this natural artistic display are four cages hanging from the ceiling, each housing a half-starved and much-abused dwarf slave. At the far end of the cave is a small forge, shimmering in the light in the room. Several worktables hold mechanical atrocities, devices of unspeakable purpose. Against the walls, between the occasional stalactite and column, stands a half-carved granite humanoid, twitching as if alive. Emerging from the shadows is a petite humanoid with pale, curly brown hair, and a wry smile distorting his face. In one hand, he carries an overlarge fork, but instead of metal tines there are crackling electrical sparks.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** Chtrax's pet artificer, Korus the gnome, works in this laboratory designing tools and devices to aid in the mining, the extraction of truesilver and whatever evil designs hatched by the xill tyrant. Though the gnome nominally works for the xill, he is not exceptionally loyal, and instead enjoys working and hurting others in the process. He keeps four derro and deep dwarf slaves in cages suspended from the ceiling as test subjects for his horrid experiments. They are on the verge of death.

Korus' greatest task, one requiring vast amounts of truesilver, is a collar and manacles set he is building. Knowing the importance of these items to the xill, he hides them behind one of the stone draperies and conceals his progress in their manufacture. He feels once the collar and manacles are complete, Chtrax's use for him may end, and Korus does not know if the xill will allow him the same amounts of freedom he has enjoyed thus far.

Korus does not attack immediately, though he is suspicious. He waits to see what the PC do or say, to assess their usefulness as allies or the threat they pose as enemies. If the PCs are amenable to conversation, despite the room's sinister atmosphere and the nasty tool in the gnome's hand, Korus eagerly engages them in conversation. On the other hand, if combat erupts, the gnome throws a hidden lever on the eastern wall of the tunnel, releasing his pet digesters before hammering the PCs with a barrage of spells.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** With a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check, Korus tells the PCs the following:

> Chtrax, a powerful xill, controls these mines. He has easily assumed control of the region, especially after the flooding and subsequent chaos. Having murdered most of the derro savants, and with the might of his formian slaves, he enjoys complete control over the derro and their minions. The xill searches for something in the depths of the world, something called the vault, though what exactly is inside, only Chtrax knows. Of his minions, only the derro are truly loyal. The stone giants work for the master only because it serves their purpose. Even the formians serve through coercion.

With a successful DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check, Korus adds the following:

> Chtrax's control over the formians exists only because he has stolen the formian queen's essence and trapped it inside a special phylactery. If you want to disrupt Chtrax's plans, destroy the box and watch them explode. One more thing, beware the tunnels in the deeper mines. Chtrax controls a tarrasque and uses it to dig the deepest tunnels.

If diplomacy fails, Korus first uses *mage hand* to throw the lever releasing his digesters in Room D54, and then casts *greater invisibility*, moving toward the exit. On the next round, he casts *expeditious retreat* and flees. If there are any survivors, he casts *wall of force*, blocking the PCs inside the room before fleeing to warn Chtrax. Korus, despite his power, would rather flee than face a band of well-armed adventurers.

The digesters, unfailingly loyal to their wicked master, open combat with a spray of acid, crossing each other's cones for maximum effect. If an opponent is particularly troublesome, surviving digesters use concentrated streams on the most threatening foes.

Killing the gnome avails the PCs little, for the manacles and collar are complete. If the PCs do not find and destroy these items, Chtrax has a 20% chance of finding them each day. For the PCs to destroy the items, simply touching them is enough, or if Chtrax fails to find them, he automatically fails to capture Kator on the seventh day when the tarrasque breaches the vault.

The captured slaves all carry xill eggs and they succumb to the infestation in 1d6 days. Up until the xill eggs hatch, they will aid the PCs in whatever capacity they can.

**Treasure:** Aside from the gnome's personal possessions, he has a wide assortment of his creations. Hidden behind a stone drapery (DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check) are the truesilver collar and manacles. Mortal hands touching these items destroy their magical properties, and these items become nothing more than mundane, albeit silver, items. Scattered throughout the room are three force clamps, six rocks of forgefire, two pocket airs, ten doses of softlight, three incomplete sounders (worth nothing) and one finished sounder. See the sidebar for details on these items.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, remove the spell level limit of Korus' Cast Spell legendary action and add three more digesters. To decrease the challenge, make the Cast Spell legendary action require two legendary actions, remove his Overchannel ability, and remove all digesters.

---

### A Sample of Korus' Tools and Other Devices

**Force Clamp:** This tool looks for all intents and purposes like a small fork, but instead of metal tines, it projects contained force. These tools allow the slaves and derro to handle truesilver without touching it, or without channeling the mortal taint through metal. A force clamp is a viable weapon; it uses the same statistics as a club. Force clamps have all the characteristics and immunities as a *wall of force*, making them virtually indestructible to physical damage.

**Forgefire:** This alchemical fuel burns hotter and longer than normal fire. The slaves use it to smelt truesilver faster and more efficiently. Unlike alchemist fire, forgefire is a solid and does not ignite unless exposed to fire. Once lit, a half-pound brick of forgefire burns for 1d6 days. You can throw forgefire, with adequate protection, but as a standard ranged attack and not as a ranged touch attack. If it hits, the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must succeed a DC 20 Dexterity save to avoid catching on fire. If lit, the victim takes 3 (1d6) points of fire damage each additional round but may extinguish the flames by succeeding a DC 15 Dexterity save.

**Pocket Air:** Created to produce a pocket of air in the case of a cave-in, this wondrous item looks like small blue marble. When cast to the ground, though, it shatters and releases a gust of wind originating from the point of impact caused by the introduction of 300 cubic ft. of new fresh air. One can throw pocket air with 10-ft. range increments, up to 50 ft. In sealed spaces, the new air fills the available space and stops.

**Softlight:** When spread out onto a flat surface, this purple dust ignites. It burns but generates no heat. Furthermore, its luminescence does not affect creatures with light sensitivity but is still enough light to cast light equivalent to bright light in a 5 ft. radius and dim lighting 10 ft. beyond. Softlight burns for 8 hours. Once lit, you cannot move it, nor does it ignite other combustibles.

**Sounder:** This unusual device looks more like a laden cart than a digging tool. Measuring 10 ft. long, the sounder rolls about on a flatbed atop six wheels. The mechanism consists of a 4-ft. wide metal cylindrical tank mounted in an iron cradle. Coolant hoses pump into the tank to its water reservoir, where it cools its magical processes venting the steam from the top. The rear of the tank houses the operation assembly. There, four levers move up and down to control the depth, height and width and intensity of the probing pulse (the greater the intensity, the more accurate the results, but the greater the risk for the machine to malfunction). The tank has small bound wire leads running into the directionally reversed cone. The cone has handles to allow its manipulation and placement onto the rock's surface. Three sharp spikes emerge from the front, i.e. its narrow end, and they automatically drill into a rocky surface. Depressing a button disengages the drills.

When activated, the Sounder sends an electromagnetic pulse into the rock, which magically returns once it reaches the specified depth, height and width. When it has pinged out and contracted, the pulse carries its information back to the reverse cone. Affixed to the fluted edge of the cone are seven lenses, tied to each color in the visible light spectrum. The color determines the density of the rock, where red is the presence of an empty space, orange signifies it is filled with heavy gases, yellow water, green loose earth, and blue rock. The darker colors imply heavier deposits such as lead or gold. If the sounder pulse hits adamantine, it emits all seven colors. In wide pulses, many densities result. In this case, the brightest light is the dominant density, while unusual pockets and anomalies may register as only a flicker. The best pulses are the high intensity, narrow beams. A pulse can extend 50 ft. into rock, with a 50 ft. width and height.

As mentioned above, a pulse's intensity dictates its accuracy. A low pulse has a 75% chance of a misread, firing a random color, but without a malfunction. A mid pulse has a 50% chance of a misread, but a 10% chance of a malfunction. A mid-high pulse has a 25% chance of a misread, but a 30% chance of malfunction. Finally, a high pulse has a 10% chance of a misread, but a 60% malfunction.

If a malfunction results, an arc of electricity leaps from the sounder to ground in the nearest living target up to 40 ft. away, dealing 8d6 points of lightning damage, DC 15 Dexterity save for half damage. Chtrax's obsession in uncovering the vault forces the engineers to use high pulses rather than the safer mid or low-pulses. As a result, the sounders claim nearly as many lives as the cave-ins.

**Truesilver Collar and Manacles:** Forged from truesilver and never touched by mortal hands, this matching collar and manacles fit a large devil. When so placed, the devil may only utilize his special attacks if the owner of the collar and manacles permits it. Chtrax commissioned these items to coerce the pit fiend Kator to give up his wish.

## D54. Pen

Piles of rotting straw and bits of bone fill this pen.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Four digesters live in this pen. If combat erupts in Room D53, Korus releases these monsters to aid him against his attackers. Otherwise, the digesters feast on the occasional slave Korus offers them, content with their fate as beloved pets.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** If the PCs somehow prevent Korus from releasing the digesters, and his life is threatened, the digesters use their acid attacks against the gate until they break out on their own. Once they engage Korus' attackers, they fight to the death, using their acid spray attacks to hit as many targets as possible.

**Treasure:** A fist-sized diamond lies under some hay, apparently undigestible. It is easily worth 5,000 gp or more but can only be found with a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add four digesters. To decrease the challenge, remove two.

---

## D55. Dead Mine

This narrow shaft extends some 40 ft. before it ends at a wall.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Chtrax, growing more impatient by the day, ordered the gnome's workshop excavated to see if the vault lays there. When the workers started to feel the heat from the lava, they moved to a different spot, abandoning this particular shaft.

**Encounter Condition:** Desecration 4, Distracting Noises, Distracting Visions, Echoes 6, Negative Energy

## D56. Mines

This narrow tunnel plunges into the rock some 40 ft. before reaching a fork. Both connecting tunnels dead-end after just a few feet.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This was another excavated tunnel, as ordered by Chtrax. After a week of incessant noise, Korus murdered all of the miners and fed their corpses to his pet digesters. There is nothing of interest left in these tunnels.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises, Distracting Visions, Echoes 6, Unhallowed

## D57-D68. Deep Mines

This section is the vanguard of the vault miners. The center of activity occurs in Room D58, with connecting tunnels branching off in several directions. The central chamber is nearly as vast as the Great Hall, roughly 100 ft. wide and 70 ft. long. Its ceiling rises to 60 ft. in the center and 40 ft. at the caverns' perimeter. The large tunnels branching off from the central cave, Rooms D59 to D62, feature ceilings 40 ft. tall. The smaller tunnels are almost all 5 ft. wide and 10 ft. tall to accommodate the grimlock foremen. Room D58 is lit with softlight, but all other rooms are dark unless mentioned otherwise. The tarrasque's noise imposes a -10 penalty to all Wisdom (Perception) checks to listen, and the dust filling the air imposes a -5 penalty to Wisdom (Perception) checks to spot things. Just like the Great Hall, this is a dangerous location, and subterfuge and infiltration are the preferred tactics over a frontal assault.

The greatest threat in this section is the tarrasque in Room D61. Tenuously controlled by a mad derro savant, this monster rapidly digs through the rock, excavating enormous amounts of stone and earth. The slaves bring the stone to Room D58, where delvers, destrachan and others work to break it down for retaining walls, gravel or simple disposal. The spider web of other tunnels house digging teams of grimlock-led slaves. These miners suffer. Their lives are nothing more than 16-hour days of toil and death. Commanding this section is the second formian myrmarch, whose responsibility it is to locate the mysterious vault.

Combat with formians in this place has similar results to combat with them throughout this region. Once one group of formians engages the PCs, the entire section goes on alert because of the hive mind link between all formians. Each room below details normal encounters and encounters when alert. In addition, each room also details what reinforcements, if any, arrive to aid their allies. Though many rooms list the number of formian warriors who arrive in waves, there are only so many formian warriors in the area. The Deep Mines have 15 unattached formian warriors, 5 unattached elite formian warriors and 1 unattached formian taskmaster. Each time the PCs engage in combat in one of the Deep Mine rooms, they undoubtedly draw more formians to their position as indicated in the room's description. Strike the number of formian warrior reinforcements killed from those listed above. When the unattached number of formian warriors or formian taskmasters falls to zero, no more formian warriors arrive. You could move formian warriors from other encounter sites to engage the PCs, but those formians are under orders to protect their respective rooms. Regardless, the Deep Mines resume normal activity after an hour lapse between combats.

On Day 3, Chtrax moves to Room D58 when the tarrasque reaches the first adamantine bands. Thereafter he has a 10% chance to be in a random room in the Great Hall, a 50% chance of being in Room D58 and a 40% chance to be inspecting the mines in Rooms D78 to D80.

Destroying the myrmarch in Room D58 or the phylactery in Room D49 alters the dynamics of the section. If the PCs destroy the myrmarch, formians in this section suffer a -2 penalty to attacks, saves, and skill checks and lose their hive mind ability. Destroying the phylactery, however, removes the hive mind ability from all the formians in the entire region, telling them their queen is dead. The formians stay in their respective locations, attacking any non-formians encountered, including the giants, derro, slaves, xill, and PCs. While in this enraged state, PCs cannot reason with them. All formians fight to the death.

Allow cautious PCs to move unmolested through this section if they do not draw attention to themselves. There are plenty of ways for the PCs to move, such as by skirting the edge of the cavern and remaining out of range of the inhabitants' darkvision. Should the PCs make a direct assault, let them feel the full weight of Chtrax's power.

If the savant retains control over the tarrasque, the tarrasque reaches the first adamantine bands on Day 3, breaches it on Day 4, the second band on Day 5, the third band on Day 6 and finally penetrates the vault on Day 7.

### Random Encounters

Roll for a Random Encounter once per hour. If the tarrasque (Room D61) breaks free, no longer roll for Random Encounters.

## D57. Entrance to the Deep Mines

The track ends at the entrance to an enormous cavern filled with slaves, formians, and more. In the center of the vast cavern, dozens of dwarven slaves are employed, hammering the rock into smaller pieces. Formians move through their ranks, their razor-sharp claws flashing in the dim light of the purple flames dancing on the floor. Branching off from this central chamber are numerous tunnels of various sizes. What is immediately obvious is the noise level, as across the tunnel, great plumes of dust and debris pour out of a tunnel. As you watch, a roar shakes the entire cavern, and all work stops, as formians, derro and dwarves alike, stop to look at the ceiling far above.

## D58. Digging Nexus

> **Note:** This is a very difficult encounter, possibly the most difficult in the dungeon. It should take several hours of game play, and we recommend GMs use crib notes before, during, after and throughout all stages of combat. Read and re-read this section before combat begins.

Loose rocks and gravel cover much of the floor area. From the connecting tunnels, emerging dusty slaves drag large rocks to a central site in the chamber, where the debris is thickest. Deep dwarf and duergar slaves hammer at the collected rock under a formian myrmarch's watchful eyes.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This is the heart of the digging operation. Working the rock piles are 24 duergar and 12 deep dwarves. Overseeing their efforts are 8 formian warriors, 2 formian taskmasters, each with a dominated destrachan, and a formian myrmarch. The destrachan use sonic attacks to shatter the larger rocks, while the slaves shatter the small rocks into gravel with mauls and picks or chisel them into blocks to use as buttresses for unstable tunnels.

Allow the myrmarch and the formian warriors Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the PCs. If they beat the PCs' Dexterity (Stealth) check, the formians attack. They consider the PCs a threat to the operation, and worse as a catalyst for releasing the tarrasque on the rest of the region.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises, Echoes 8

**Tactics:** The taskmasters set the destrachan against the PCs and use their *dominate monster* ability against the PCs, while the warriors circle the group. The myrmarch uses *feeblemind*, followed by *suggestion* before closing and engaging in melee. If Chtrax is absent and the PCs surrender, the formian myrmarch dispatches two warriors to escort the PCs to the region's entrance at Room D6. If Chtrax is present, the formians give no quarter, cutting the PCs down to the last. The slaves keep working throughout combat, defending themselves only if attacked.

If combat persists for more than 3 rounds, 1d6 unattached formian warriors arrive each round until all of the unattached formian warriors arrive. If combat continues for 6 rounds, the formian sentries at Room D65 come to assist. The inhabitants of other rooms do not join, holding their positions, rather than risk the ire of the xill master.

If the tarrasque breaks free at room D61, the formians drive the slaves forward to meet the threat in a futile effort to halt the monster's advance. The myrmarch sends one of the formian warriors to Chtrax to warn the master of the monsters' release.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase each formian warrior's hit points by +20. To decrease the challenge, remove one of the taskmasters and the destrachan.

## D59. Mine

Working in this wide tunnel is a score of duergar slaves, slowly chipping away at the dense rock. Barking orders in Undercommon are two humanoids. Though blind, they are clearly aware of the goings on in this tunnel.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** Slowly digging through the dense rock are 18 duergar slaves, suffering under the whips and lashings of the grimlock overseers. They live to please their master but take no part in combat in the neighboring areas. Replacement slaves come from the Great Hall and other sections throughout the region.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises, Echoes 8

**Tactics:** No amount of conversation or bargaining distracts these workers from their task, cowed as they are by Chtrax and the neighboring tarrasque. A successful DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check panics the teams, who flee to Room D58, seeking protection from the myrmarch. If the PCs have already destroyed the myrmarch, they flee to the Great Hall and out of the region if possible. These creatures are no threat to the PCs, unless, of course, they succeed in locating the vault.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## D60. Big Mine

A line of four formian sentries stands guard here, as clouds of dust and small rocks spew past them from behind. Beyond the line of guards, you see a mammoth monster of enormous proportions. Armored and bristling with horns, its massive claws tear through the rock with ease. Standing at its side is a bloodied and dusty derro, whose features are blank aside from a beatific smile.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** In a futile effort to curb the tarrasque, should he break the derro's control, these four elite formian warriors (hp 102) stand guard. While they maintain a constant vigilance in watching the tarrasque behind them, they also guard against saboteurs who would throw the region into chaos by breaking the monster free. Given Souiji's recent efforts, these guards are extra watchful.

If the PCs approach within 10 ft. of the tunnel's entrance, the elite formian warriors attack. These creatures fight to the death.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If attacked, these warriors alert the rest of the formians in the deep mines to the presence of intruders. Two move forward while the other two remain in the tunnel to prevent anyone from getting past them. The formian myrmarch at Room D58, if he still lives, sends one warrior to alert Chtrax and then joins the fight with his remaining warriors the following round. On the next round, any remaining unattached formians in the Deep Mines arrive. On the round after, the formian sentries from Room D65, if they still survive, join the fight.

If combat continues through six rounds, the mad savant in Room D61 comes to see what is wrong. The savant heroically joins the fight, using destructive spells. However, each round the savant is away from the tarrasque, there is a cumulative 5% chance for the tarrasque to break the derro's control. Worse, if the savant dies, the tarrasque automatically breaks free. Should this happen, consult this section's introduction for details.

If the tarrasque at Room D61 breaks free, these formians act as the first line of defense, concerting their attacks in a futile effort to defeat the monster.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two elite formian warriors to the line of sentries. To decrease the challenge, remove two and delay reinforcements by 2 rounds for each wave.
