# Region C (continued)

## C97. Broken Walls

PCs in Room C48 can hear a soft clamor of metal on stone, coming from the other side of the wall of stone. However, because the stone is so dense, they cannot determine that a hill giant is pounding away at it.

The sound of stone breaking upon stone echoes throughout this chamber and beyond. Inside the wide hall is a large giant in tattered hides. The male giant stands in the middle of the room, surrounded by massive mounds of stony rubble. One of its eyes is swollen shut, as though it suffered a tremendous blow. The creature seems hard at work, as it takes heavy boulders, raises them above its head, and throws them as hard as it can against the surrounding walls, which are heavily damaged from years of such abuse. Each time the giant throws a boulder, it refuses to fragment into smaller pieces.

**Initial Attitude:** Varies

**Encounter:** A small portion of the east wall is a corridor blocked with a wall of stone. A DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies it. When Arum fought the hill giant Vernir, he encased him in stone in this great hall. Though his family eventually freed him, Vernir frequently visits the chamber, hoping to demolish the stony remains of his former prison.

Vernir spends most of his time in this hall smashing the stone walls created by Arum. The rubble is from the damage Vernir dealt to the stonework over the years. Because Vernir is working and not paying attention to what goes on around him, he suffers from Disadvantage to any Wisdom (Perception) checks.

If one of the PCs is a male human spellcaster (in dark-colored robes), Vernir is hostile and attacks him on sight. Otherwise, his initial attitude is unfriendly, as he is suspicious of humanoids. If the PCs talk to Vernir, the hill giant mutters "You should not be here. This is mother's territory." To reinforce his comment, he demands a 20 gp toll from each of them. If the PCs pay the toll, or if they convince Vernir they mean no harm, he brings them to his mother in Room C98. If the PCs promise to leave the hill giant's domain, Vernir still insists they pay the toll.

**Encounter Condition:** Cover, Echoes 5

**Tactics:** If there is a battle here, Vernir's mother and brother do not come to his aid. Both giants are accustomed to the constant din of breaking boulders and crashing rocks. Unless the PCs make some kind of unusual noise the other hill giants remain in place.

In combat, Vernir takes cover behind a stone pile and throws boulders at the party. He targets the spellcasters first. If forced into melee, he handles the enemies within his reach, using his massive steel maul.

**Treasure:** Vernir carries a pouch with 11 bloodstones, worth 20 gp each.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a damage die to each of Vernir's attacks. To decrease the challenge, Vernir becomes Frightened when a PC casts an offensive spell at him or uses magic to do anything "obvious."

## C98. Hill Giant Shrine

If the PCs make any noise or use a light source in the corridor leading to this chamber, Arnuk automatically notices them.

A stone altar dominates this chamber. Upon the altar is a pair of human skulls inside of which yellow candles are set. The candles burn with a pale golden light, illuminating portions of the room. Behind the altar is a giant female. Her long, disheveled hair is tangled with small bones and a scorched human skull hangs from a thick gold chain around her neck.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** Arnuk built a crude shrine to her deity in this wide chamber, and the hill giant priestess spends most of her recreational time here. Unless the PCs have harmed one of her sons or they attack her immediately, Arnuk is more than willing to negotiate. She is especially interested in the dragon's hoard (Room C75) and killing the black dragon guarding it. If the PCs appear interested, she reveals where it is and even warns them about the deadly creature in Room C76 and the trap in Room C94. She does not know Room C75 is a false hoard.

If the PCs offend her god or harmed one of her sons, Arnuk attacks immediately.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If battle ensues, Arnuk casts divine favor on herself followed by shield of faith. She then proceeds to cast an offensive spell to harm or hamper the PCs, targeting the warriors of the party first. Since she has a 10 ft. reach, she keeps the PCs at bay for a round or two, at least, before using her magical mace to crush her enemies. She continues to cast spells when not engaged directly with two or more PCs.

Arnuk utters loud cries and curses while combating the PCs, which automatically alerts her son Mourgir (Room C101). Mourgir comes to defend his mother 1d3 rounds later.

**Treasure:** In addition to the magical items Arnuk carries, she also has a pouch with 79 pp, 51 gp, and 19 sp, as well as three glass vials of unholy water. The unholy symbol upon her neck is made from a painted human skull and worth upwards of 25 gp to any follower of the faith. The golden chain upon which it is set is also worth 25 gp.

**Scaling:** To decrease the challenge, take away Arnuk's warhammer.

## C99. Vernir's Chamber

A massive bed made of broken logs, crushed tree branches, and dried leaves occupies most of the floor area of this room. The crude bed is covered with tattered animal pelts and is large enough to accommodate a pair of giants. Beside it are several perfectly round rocks.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is the private bedchamber of Vernir, Arnuk's youngest son. Vernir uses this chamber to rest, but spends most of his time in Room C97. Since he does not trust Mourgir (Room C101), he carries his bloodstones with him, leaving only battered skins on his bed.

If the PCs make noise, Arnuk (in Room C98) automatically hears them and investigates 1 round later. Also allow Mourgir the appropriate Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the PCs. If he hears them, Mourgir arrives in 1d3 rounds.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## C100. Arnuk's Chamber

Four old beds are arranged in the middle of this room, taking up most of the floor. The beds are lined up against one another and a thick layer of animal skins covers them. On top of the pelts is a human skull, neatly placed at the exact center of the four beds.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This is Arnuk's private abode and she does not tolerate anyone coming into her bedroom. Although she is only here when she rests, the room is close enough to her shrine that she can keep an eye on it. She investigates 1 round later and does not hesitate to attack would-be thieves. Allow Mourgir (Room C101) the appropriate Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the PCs. If he does, the hill giant comes out of his bedchamber and arrives here 1d3 rounds thereafter.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a wooden coffer tucked under a bed. This chest is unlocked and contains various robes fashioned for a giant as well as a total of 541 gp worth of assorted coins and gems, a well-wrought sapphire (worth 500 gp), and a wand of magic missiles.

**Scaling:** N/A

## C101. Mourgir's Chamber

A large pile of crushed stone rubble covered with broken twigs and branches dominates the northern area of this room. A dark-haired giant dressed in hide armor sits atop the uncomfortable-looking bed.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** This is the private bedroom of Mourgir, Arnuk's eldest son. Though the hill giant sometimes patrols his mother's domain, he spends most of his time in this chamber, dreaming about the fresh air of his mountain home. For such a savage creature, he is (at times), noticeably sensitive. As such, his mother is more protective of him than Vernir (Room C97).

Although suspicious, Mourgir is curious about the PCs and eager to talk with them. He is especially interested in tales of the open country and the mountains surrounding the dungeon. If the PCs are friendly and tell stories, his attitude automatically shifts to friendly. If, on the other hand, they harmed his brother or mother, or if they tried to steal from Room C102, Mourgir does not hesitate and attacks.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** Mourgir does not throw rocks, preferring instead to charge the strongest warriors and engage in melee. He fights until his hit point total is reduced to 25 or less, at which point he flees for Room C98. If combat breaks out here, Arnuk (in Room C98) arrives 1d3 rounds later.

**Treasure:** Mourgir wears a large necklace made of carved bone fragments (worth 20 gp) and carries a pouch with 97 gp worth of small gemstones.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a damage die to each of Mourgir's attacks. To decrease the challenge, have him frazzled by a recent argument with his brother, and thus suffering from the effects of bane.

## C102. Hill Giants' Storeroom

A rounded, flat boulder blocks the only entrance leading to this room, which is used by the giants to store the various goods they found in the dungeon. A successful DC 22 Strength check is required to move the boulder in front of the door. This action, however, automatically alerts Mourgir that someone is trying to enter the store. Since he is in charge of it, the giant comes out of his chamber (Room C101) to investigate 1 round later. If Mourgir engages the PCs in battle, his mother (in Room C98) joins the fray 1d3 rounds after combat begins.

Three piles of round rocks and a wide mound of broken bones take up most of this room, which is used for storage. Upon the southernmost wall is a collection of weapons and other gear. Trinkets lie in an untidy pile near this equipment.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** There are piles of boulders here, as well as skull trophies and the like. The body of an adventurer can be found among the debris as well, stripped of its gear and left to rot. Fiendish GMs can make the adventurer a familiar face from one of the PCs' past.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Along the south wall are three large greatclubs, a rusty greatsword, two disheveled halberds, an ornate masterwork falchion, a medium suit of masterwork full plate armor, a +2 large steel shield, three coils of 50-ft.-long hempen rope, two empty backpacks, and a small wooden box containing 16 wax candles.

**Scaling:** N/A

## C103-C105. The Key

The doors of this section of the dungeon have not been breached since the angel wardens abandoned it. Built within the vast prison complex, this area was used to store an important key. This special key opens the door in Room B21 (and thus gives access to Region F). It can be found in Room C105, but can only be handled by PCs bearing the Mark of the Righteous (see Room C21), as it is an animated object; attacking anyone not bearing the Mark who touches it.

To complicate things, the angel builders of the dungeon designed a false key (in Room C103) as well as a series of six interconnected rooms (C104) made to deceive would-be robbers.

There are no random encounters in this section.

## C103. The False Key

Both doors leading into this room are locked. Anyone succeeding at a DC 23 Dexterity check unlocks them.

The walls of this room are beautifully painted. The pictures depict various angels performing blissful tasks. Some hold weapons and stand at attention. Others are sculpting great works of art or designing tall buildings. Though thick dust covers the floor of this room, its painted walls are surprisingly clean. What truly catches one's attention, however, is the glowing silvery key resting upon a simple stone altar in the southern nook of the chamber.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The only purpose of this room is to deceive others into believing a false key is the key needed to unlock the door in Room B21. Unlike the keys found in Room C104, this false key is a perfect replica of the one fitting into the lock of Room B21. When inserted into this lock, however, a powerful sonic blast is triggered and the fake key melts into the mechanism, preventing anyone from unlocking the door.

Anyone with the Mark of the Righteous (see Room C21) is allowed a DC 15 Intelligence save to learn this key is a fake.

The secret panel upon the south wall is impossible to notice or open by normal means. A PC with the Mark of the Righteous is automatically made aware of the secret door and only needs to touch it to watch the panel sink into the floor. The secret doorway remains open for as long as someone with the Mark of the Righteous stands within Room C103 or the adjacent Room C104.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The only treasure in this room is the false special key upon the altar.

**Scaling:** N/A

## C104. Rigged False Keys

The only door leading into these six interconnected rooms is locked. A PC succeeding at a DC 21 Dexterity check unlocks it. Each of these rooms holds 20 different keys, hanging at varying heights from the ceiling on strands of wire above a simple stone altar. The keys vary in size, shape, and color. Each is made from a unique material.

A small altar lies in the middle of the south wall. Hanging from the ceiling are several keys of various sizes, shapes, and materials. Some are made of silver, gold, bronze, copper or steel. Some of wood, granite, ivory, colored glass, semi-precious stone, and alien material you've never seen before.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** These six chambers hold a total of 120 false keys (20 per room) made to confuse, hamper, or harm trespassers. Each key is different. Some are trapped, while others are mere trinkets serving no real purpose. Every time a PC picks up one of the keys, roll on the following table to determine its effect:

| 20 | This key radiates strong evocation. It bestows a curse on the bearer, who can only get rid of it with a wish spell, or similar spell-like effect. The curse is up to the GM but should be minor, like an odd walk or the inability to sleep more than 3 hours a night. |

### False Key Effects, Table III

| D20 | Key Effect |
|:---:|:-----------|
| 1 | The key is a mundane key that does not fit any lock. |
| 2 | This key is brittle and crumbles to dust when touched. |

| 20 | This key radiates strong magic. It bestows a curse on the bearer, who can only get rid of it with a wish, or similar spell-like effect. The curse is up to the GM but should minor, like stumpy fingers or constant dry mouth. |

All keys (except 20) radiate strong Abjuration and Evocation. A PC with the Mark of the Righteous (see room C21) is allowed a DC 16 Wisdom save in each of these six rooms to determine all 20 keys are useless.

If at least one PC already has the Mark of the Righteous, he is instantly made aware of the secret doorway in the north wall in the easternmost room. A PC with the Mark touching the panel watches it sink into the floor.

Otherwise, this secret door is impossible to see.

## C105. Test of Charity

The door of this room opens when the PCs step into Room C104, but remains open only for 5 rounds. PCs need to succeed at the Test of Humility in order to discover this door. However, this secret panel also shuts as soon as one person enters this room. It is impossible to open once it is closed, but PCs on either side succeeding at a DC 28 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check can move in or out of the room before the door closes. The door opens by itself once a PC selects an item from one of the cubby-holes.

There are three items in the cubby-holes against the northern wall of this otherwise empty room: a chest filled with gold pieces, a beautiful golden rose, and an intricate sword with a strange runic mark on it. Above the items are the words "Choose from the Heart", written in silvery Celestial runes.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** In order to pass the Test of Charity, the PC must select an item and explain why he chose it. The actual item chosen by the PC is not important, but what they plan to do with it is.

There is no correct answer.

It is up to the GM to determine as best they can what motivated the PC in their selection. Charitable motives include taking one of the treasures to offer it to another, to a faith, or a cause. If the PC was charitable, they pass the test. If they were not, they fail.

Once any item is touched, the rest disappear. Failing the test sends a powerful electrical discharge of chain lightning through the room. All characters must make a Dexterity save for half damage or suffer 10d8 lightning damage.

Succeeding the test results in the PC receiving the Mark of the Righteous (as explained in Room C21) and all benefits it bestows, including being allowed to enter Room C103.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** It is recommended that this encounter be run individually with each PC. The answer to each question should not be heard by the others, to gauge the honesty of their remarks.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the damage of the electrical discharge to 16d6. To decrease the challenge, reduce the damage to 8d6.

## C105. The Real Special Key

The secret panel leading into this room is impossible to see or open by normal means. A PC with the Mark of the Righteous is automatically made aware of this secret doorway. They need to touch the panel to make it sink into the floor. The secret door remains open as long as someone with the Mark of the Righteous stands in Room C105 or the adjacent Room C104.

An untraceable light source simulating daylight illuminates this chamber. The walls, floor, and ceiling are painted white and their surfaces are surprisingly clean. In the center of the room is a simple altar made from the same painted stone. A silver key, glowing brightly in the magical light, rests upon it.

**Initial Attitude:** Helpful or Hostile (see below)

**Encounter:** This room holds the real special key allowing the angels and archons that built the dungeon to move from Room B21 to Region F. The only way to gain access to this room is by having the Mark of the Righteous. Once the door opens for a PC with the Mark, others can accompany them inside.

The silvery key on the altar is a special animated object. When picked by someone with the Mark of the Righteous it remains inanimate, just as any other key. However, if someone without the Mark takes the key at any time or place, it becomes animated and flies around the room trying to avoid capture. If destroyed, the key becomes useless. Otherwise, it can be used to unlock the door in Room B21, thus giving access to Region F.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** This animated object targets creatures not bearing the Mark of the Righteous and never strikes those blessed with such a Mark. It fights until destroyed, but if a full round elapses without anyone trying to strike it, it ceases to attack and falls prone (as if it were not animated). If this happens, a PC with the Mark of the Righteous can pick it up. If someone without the Mark takes it again, however, it becomes animated again and flies off.

**Treasure:** The special key rests upon the altar. It is the only key that unlocks the door in Room B21.

**Scaling:** N/A

## C106-C110. The Final Mile

Rooms C106-C110 are isolated from the rest of the region. Though they connect with Region G, and the base of the angels and celestials inhabiting this part of the dungeon, no creatures have graced this area in many years.

There are no Random Encounters in this section.

## C106. The Angels' Insignia

The floor of the corridor is blanketed in undisturbed dust. The double doors at its northern end are cast from solid bronze. Upon them is a design: a flaming sword encircled by a ring of feathers.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** These corridors connect Region C and G together. Though there are no traps here, the bronze double doors in these corridors are locked. A successful DC 21 Dexterity check is required to unlock them. The insignia upon them is the symbol of the Order of the Children of the Inner Light, the group of angels and celestials in charge of protecting Region G. The symbol marks the beginning of their territory.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## C107. Trapped Corridors

This hallway is dusty, dark, and empty. A closer look at the floor reveals a rune in the center of the corridor. Though covered with dust, the design is easily spotted, as it is over 10-ft. in diameter. The marking represents an angel holding a wide blade, its feathery wings spread wide behind its back.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The corridors to the east and west of Room C108 are trapped. The designs upon the floor in each of these corridors are meant to attract the attention of travelers. The patterns take the entire width of the hallways and are at least 10 ft. long. Anyone stepping upon the markings or touching them automatically triggers the magical trap placed upon them. There is no way to bypass these traps, and creatures flying above the designs automatically trigger them.

**Glyph of Warding (Explosive Runes).** Detect: DC 19 Intelligence (Arcana); Disable: DC 19 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters in the hallway DC 14 Dexterity save for half damage or suffer 5d8 thunder damage.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the save DC of the glyph of warding trap by +4. To decrease the challenge, replace the glyph of warding trap with a burning hands trap.

## C108. Intricate Mosaic

A large and perfectly round mosaic made out of stones of varying shapes and colors takes up most of the floor of this chamber. The mosaic is exquisitely designed and its many patterns are abstract and fascinating. They are somewhat reminiscent of the complex patterns made by the artisans who fashion the marvelous carpets in the Southern Realms, yet a thousand times more elaborate.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The floor of this chamber is rigged with a simple but effective pit trap. A closer look at the mosaic reveals the colorful stones composing it are not attached to the floor and could be extracted from the pattern. Anyone touching the stones from the mosaic or stepping upon them automatically triggers the pit trap. When activated, the floor of the entire room opens, sending all the stones from the mosaic inside a deep pit.

PCs who do not disturb the mosaic can move safely through the room without triggering the trap.

**Pit Trap.** Detect: DC 18 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 22 Dexterity; Characters in the room DC 17 Dexterity save or fall 100 ft. and take 10d6 bludgeoning damage each.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** At the bottom of the pit trap are bony remains of a dead unidentifiable creature. A golden armband (worth 190 gp) is attached to one of the bones and a +3 halberd rests under them.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add another 40 ft. to the pit trap. To decrease the challenge, reduce the trap to 60 ft.

## C109. Dispiriting Hall

A series of torches set 20 ft. from the floor into thick bronze sconces burn here. The dancing flames illuminate the great hall, but fail to keep the eerie shadows very far.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This great hall is empty but endowed with powerful angelic magic meant to discourage living creatures from venturing through it. Lawful good creatures are not affected by the enchantment, but all other living beings are, including outsiders such as demons.

Upon entering, all non-lawful good PCs must make a DC 21 Wisdom save or become disheartened for one full week. A disheartened character suffers from a -2 morale penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls, AC, saves, and skill checks. A remove curse is not strong enough to lift this effect, but each one reduces the duration of the effect by 1 day.

**Encounter Condition:** Cursed 5, Fear 16

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** All 40 torches are imbued with continual flame.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the Wisdom save DC by +2 and add one week to the disheartening effect. To reduce the challenge, reduce the effect to 1d4 days. Alternatively, it only affects non-lawful characters.

## C110. The Gateway

A wide ornate archway dominates the southern wall of this great hall. The archway opens into a surprisingly vast room, but the rest of the hall is empty and dark. A close examination of the cloak of dust upon the floor here reveals that no one has walked here in years.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This chamber has a magical gateway that allows travel to Room C21, but offers no means of exiting.

This hall has a portal identical to the large ornate archway in Room C21, with the exception that the interior of the archway is not solid. Instead, it opens into Room C21, just as if the two chambers were connected. This is the one-way entrance into the prison cell where a great demon was once held prisoner. Any object that goes through the archway from Room C110 instantly comes out the other archway in Room C21. Inanimate objects that partially pass through the portal can be retrieved, but anything living or organic is stuck in Room C21. Nothing from Room C21 can travel back through the portal in this hall.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the PCs lose limbs if they stick their hands through the portal and pull them back. To decrease the challenge, allow the PCs to move back and forth without fail, indicating the wards protecting this prison vanished decades ago.
