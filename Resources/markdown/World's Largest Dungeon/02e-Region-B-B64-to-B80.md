# Region B (continued)

## B64. A Long Way Down

This simple chamber is quite nondescript, except for a pair of high-quality long spears abandoned in the center of the room. Two gems, in the opposite wall, stare back at you, like a pair of red eyes.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Like Room B63, the bugbears set up a simple pit trap to snare goblin scouts. The long spears have been left to lure the unsuspecting goblins into a trap. If that doesn't work, the gems in the wall will. The floor beneath the long spears (5-ft-by-5-ft square) can only support 10 lbs. before it opens, dropping the victim(s) into the 60 ft pit below if they fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A locking mechanism can be found, with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 15), behind a panel in the eastern wall. Once the switch is flipped, the doors to the pit do not open and the PCs can travel across the room safely.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The gems are only painted glass, designed to lure goblins across the room. They cannot be removed from the wall, short of a DC 30 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If removed, the bugbears replace them in 1d3 days. This trap is either an indication that bugbears aren't very inventive or that goblins aren't hard to trick.

**Treasure:** The two spears are normal spears, which the PCs are free to take once they have circumvented the trap. The gems are worthless glass.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the depth of the pit trap by 20 ft. To decrease the challenge, reduce the depth of the pit trap by 20 ft.

---

## B65. Storage

The door to this room is locked. A DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check is required to unlock it. The smell of death inside is evident before the PCs open the door.

As soon as you open the door, the smell of death assaults you. This small room has a pile of dead goblins, who are rotting. Flies and maggots fill the air, escaping past the PCs and into the open air. Stacked along the walls are all manner of wood beams, spikes, polearms, and tripwires.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is filled with the tools and equipment for making traps (not to mention a half-dozen dead goblins). It looks as though it is regularly used, but how the bugbears endure the stench is another story.

**Encounter Condition:** Diseased (mindfire) 12, Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** While mindfire is normally inhaled, if the PCs avoid touching the goblins, they gain advantage on the Constitution saves to resist the mindfire.

**Treasure:** If the PCs have the stomach for it, they can search the dead bodies, finding a total of 36 sp, 14 cp, a key to the door in Room B80, and a potion of jump.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## B66. Bugbear Hideout

The door to this room is locked, requiring DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.

Unless the PCs succeed at a DC 25 Dexterity (Stealth) check while opening the lock, read the following:

This room is enormous. The vaulted ceiling and painted walls make this room appear larger than life. Standing, weapons at the ready, are eight tall, angry, grizzled goblinoids covered in mottled brown fur, their jagged teeth exposed.

If the PCs succeed in picking the lock quietly, read the following:

This room is enormous. The vaulted ceiling and painted walls make this room appear larger than life. Pacing about the room, sharpening weapons, and sifting through crates are eight tall, grizzly goblinoids covered in mottled fur, their jagged teeth exposed. They do not notice you.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly or Hostile

**Encounter:** Eight **bugbears** are using this room to plan a raid on the goblins. Normally, they are mobilized, moving about the halls, but these bugbears have a plan up their sleeves. They intend to gather their strength together, sneak through the maze (Room B92), and attack the sleeping goblin army from behind. By striking from the far end of the goblin empire, they hope to distract the main arm of the army and send a smaller force to kill the goblin king. If the bugbears do not notice the PCs, they continue planning their attack. However, every so often, allow one of them a Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the PCs. If the PCs watch for too long, the bugbears assume they are spies and attack. If the PCs approach peacefully, however, there is an opportunity to work with the bugbears. Allow the PCs to role-play through the situation or use Wisdom (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) to diffuse the hostilities.

If attacked, or enraged, **Oskin** attacks the PCs.

**Encounter Condition:** Fearless

**Tactics:** If the PCs try to strike a bargain with the bugbears, **Oskin** (the largest of the eight) listens to what the PCs have to say and, if he trusts them, invites them to help on the raid, asking them to attack from the north while they use the maze to disguise their approach. In combat, the bugbears fight to silence the PCs. Two rush to block the door, while the rest flank the PCs. Oskin directs the battle for two rounds before attacking the largest PC. They are tireless fighters and have no qualms about killing the PCs.

**Treasure:** All of the bugbears carry well-crafted weapons and are prepared for battle. Oskin carries two potions of healing and a potion of the giant's strength.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two bugbears. To decrease the challenge, remove two.

---

## B67. The Last Line of Defense

This room is large and appears empty, but something about it bristles with menace. There are no signs of the goblins occupying this room, so it must still be in the domain of the bugbears. Why they have chosen to leave it empty is a mystery, however.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The bugbears have littered this room with as many traps as possible. If the goblins seek to take their final hidden refuge (Room B68), the bugbears plan on exacting a heavy toll.

Scattered around the room are six different traps, each placed in such a way that the PCs cannot avoid them all if they move between the doors on the western and northeastern walls. The GM is free to trigger as many or as few of the following traps as he likes.

The basic arrow and spear traps occur three times throughout the room and the dart traps occur twice.

### Spear Trap

Running perpendicular to the walls are 3 spear traps with simple 5-ft. wide tripwires placed in their line of fire. Each launches its payload at the unfortunate PC who triggers it, dealing 1d8 damage if they fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Should they succeed, the next PC that would be behind them must succeed the save or be struck instead. Disarming it is as simple as knocking it over, where the tension will be undone safely.

### Poisoned Darts

Tiny clusters of darts sit loaded into a pair of crude launchers in each of the far corners of the room. When their awkwardly strewn triggers are depressed a spray of darts snap across the room. Starting from the east wall, in a 15-ft. cone pointing towards the center of the room, any creature not completely obscured by another must succeed a Dexterity (DC 13) saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage and be poisoned until their next long rest.

The launchers can be found with a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disabled with a further DC 9 Sleight of Hand check. Failing the check launches the darts. Undoing this mechanism leaves the darts open for the taking. The first time a dart deals damage it loses its poison and poisons the damaged creature if they fail a Constitution (DC 14) save.

### Swinging Block

Directly in the center of the room is a single 10-ft. tripwire that can be noticed if a PC rolls higher than a 14 on an Intelligence (Investigation) check. Triggering the trap causes a heavy stone block to swing towards the trigger's location, requiring a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid. Failure to do so deals 3d8 bludgeoning damage. If the save succeeds, any creature occupying that space in the next few seconds must save again or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage as the block swings back through. This repeats once more, with one less damage die.

### Arrow Trap

Pointed randomly about the room are 3 arrow traps. Within their line of fire are numerous crossed and web-like triggers. They are obvious, intentionally so, painted with bright colors. To navigate their zone of fire PCs must succeed an Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check (DC 15). No traps have triggers that intersect these as they are meant to drive victims into the range of the less obvious traps. Failure to avoid the trigger requires a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 1d6 piercing damage. Disarming any of these traps requires simply knocking it over.

**Tactics:** The object of this room is to introduce the PCs to the traps of the Region. The bugbears are not likely to invite strangers in and this room is designed to encourage PCs to find another way in. Getting to Room B68, the PCs find it a dead-end and now have to move across the room again. Unless 1d4 hours have passed since they moved through this room, the bugbears have not reset this trap.

Unlike other trapped rooms in this section, there are no dead goblins here. If the PCs enter this room from the secret door to the south, it is not as important to "hurt" the PCs with this room, since they are more than aware of the region's dangers. It is recommended the PCs feel discouraged, but are not killed by this room.

The door to the south leads to a secret door that requires a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate. The secret door is locked, but a simple DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check allows the PCs to spin the door open on its central axis.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, allow two traps to go off at the same time. To decrease the challenge, have each trap occur only once.

---

## B68. Refuge

Lined with empty supply racks, this room feels safe and secure. Currently, there is nothing in the room aside from the empty shelves.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** If the goblins ever overrun the bugbear encampments, the bugbears plan to fall back to this room. Guarded by the traps in Room B67, they can wage a war of attrition against the goblins to the very end. They know that if things become this dire they are doomed, but they plan on taking as many goblins as they can with them.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe

**Tactics:** If the PCs admit to the bugbears that they have entered the refuge, it shifts their attitude one step closer to Hostile. Once Hostile, the bugbears attack the PCs on sight in all future encounters, having spread the word.

**Treasure:** There are a few daggers, arrows, and the like, but nothing of value. Allow the PCs to resupply up to 1d20 arrows, bolts, darts, and 1d6 spears.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## B69-B91. The Holy Goblin Empire

These rooms encompass the might of the goblin empire that has recently been forged by their new king, Argliss in the name of their new god.

Musty smells and dampness unknown in the rest of the dungeon fill the air here. The traps laid by the celestials still work, and the goblins learned long ago to avoid the rooms that contain them.

From these rooms, the goblins have unleashed a vicious war of conquest and retribution against the bugbears and rebel goblin faction. Had the hobgoblins not accepted the offer to join Argliss, no doubt they too would have felt the goblins' wrath.

If the PCs have allied themselves with the bugbears (Rooms B51-B68), they will have a difficult time concealing their activities from the goblins. The goblins are highly suspicious of newcomers and attack any on sight. Only a command from their king stays their hand. Argliss does not give the PCs free passage if he has any reason to believe that the PCs have allied themselves with any group other than his fledgling empire.

Bugbears occasionally enter the goblin empire to wreak havoc. If the PCs have allied themselves with the bugbears and do not assist them here, word gets back and any inroads the PCs have with the bugbears are shattered.

### Random Encounters

Roll for a Random Encounter once per hour.

| D20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | The sounds of well-disciplined goblin troops in close-order drills resonate throughout the dungeon. **Echoes 6.** |
| 2 | The howls of worgs echo through the halls, the footfalls of goblins close behind. It is impossible to discern the direction. **Echoes 10.** |

---

## B69. The Sentries

Most likely, the goblins spot the PCs long before they spot the goblins. If for some reason they do not and sneak up on the patrol, read the following:

The hallway stretches before you, a group of goblins stands guard. They are strangely well organized, and well equipped. Each came with a short spear and buckler, methodically patrolling the hallway moving about 10 feet in each direction.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** A patrol has been stationed here to prevent bugbears from entering the empire by the most obvious route. Due to their darkvision, they can see enemies coming and due to the darkness of the halls, they are more than likely to see PC torches. As a result, the six **goblin fighters** who rotate their patrol with the goblins in Room B70 prepare to ambush the PCs, sending for reinforcements while they wait inside the various nearby hiding places.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), Cover

**Tactics:** As soon as the goblins spot the PCs, they take up defensive positions in the nearby halls, while the smallest two run to Room B70 for reinforcements. Depending on how the PCs approach, they either wait for the PCs to pass (coming from the west) or head straight there (coming from the south or east). Room B70 is approximately 50 ft. away, and it takes one turn for them to make it there, and 3d6 seconds for the goblins inside to get their gear together.

These goblins have been trained by the hobgoblins. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up into ranks, four goblins abreast. They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest with their spears. The goblins hold their bucklers facing forward, offering more protection (+1 AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them, fighting better close in.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, give the goblins total cover for the first 3 rounds of combat. To decrease the challenge, reinforcements arrive in double the time.

> ### Tactics of the Holy Goblin Empire
>
> Under the guidance of the hobgoblins, the goblin forces loyal to Argliss the Goblin King are quite formidable. They wield short spears & wooden bucklers, attacking foes in well-coordinated phalanx maneuvers. They advance on their enemies with the cold precision that has been drilled into them by their hobgoblin taskmasters.
>
> The hobgoblins, for their part, have formed an effective cavalry unit. Mounted on trained worgs, they dart in and out of their foes, flanking them with rapid attacks. The bugbears and rebel goblins have not had success against these new tactics. The lightning attacks of the hobgoblins, coupled with the relentless ones of the foot soldiers have proved an effective combination.

---

## B70. Forward Outpost

If the goblins did not assist the patrol in Room B96, read the following:

This long room is an outpost for goblin patrols, who are going through the grind of cleaning weapons, and so on.

If the goblins did assist the patrol in Room B69, read the following:

This long room is an outpost for the goblins. The goblin reinforcements spilled out of this room, leaving nothing behind. A few hides are laid out in precise rows for sleeping. Now empty weapon racks rest against the western wall of the room. These aren't typical chaotic goblins. They are well-disciplined.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** If the ten **elite goblins** in this room did not assist the goblin patrol in Room B69, they are present. They gather their equipment (requiring a turn of not moving) and attack the PCs. If the goblins did assist the patrol, then this room is empty.

**Encounter Condition:** Cover (soft)

**Tactics:** These goblins have been trained by hobgoblins. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form ranks, four goblins abreast, two rows deep. The smallest two escape through the north door, to get reinforcements from Rooms B71, B72, and B73. Alternatively, they throw javelins from the rear ranks.

They advance stabbing the closest PCs with their spears. They hold their bucklers facing forward, offering more protection (increasing the AC by +1) to the goblin on their left. They allow the PCs to rush them, fighting most effectively in close proximity.

This is not an easy encounter and should be an indication of this Section's difficulty. These goblins are not pushovers and challenging them may be harder than the PCs thought (which is why the bugbears have trouble fighting them).

**Treasure:** 1d20 javelins and 1d6 spears survive the battle. If the PCs did not fight the goblins here, double the number of weapons found. There are also four suits of leather armor (goblin-sized).

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have Haglar Quickwhip (Room B71) arrive 4d6 seconds later (without the goblins retrieving him). To decrease the challenge, remove four goblins.

---

## B71. Haglar Quickwhip

The door opens slowly. The air reeks of unpleasant odors, but the room itself is laid out neatly. A simple cot is placed against the southern wall, while a desk with various maps and notes sits near the western wall.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** **Haglar Quickwhip** is the taskmaster for the forward outpost. He also is in charge of the small jail in Rooms B72 and B73. He is a formidable opponent and a tireless leader. He trains the goblins constantly. He drives the strong to be strong and the weak to grow up or move on. He has no patience for those who cannot keep up. Even while the patrols sleep, Haglar trains, does push-ups, and generally stays alert. He's the quintessential elite single-minded warrior.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush, Concealment, Echoes 2, Fearless

**Tactics:** If Haglar hears the PCs coming, he prepares for an ambush, attacking from the shadows. Haglar stays out of reach of melee combat, deftly using his whip to both attack and drive back the PCs. He maneuvers around the room as best as he can, despite the limited space. Since he is not above hurting those weaker than him, a spellcaster foolish enough to expose himself is an easy target.

If forced into melee combat, he disarms the nearest PC and uses their weapon or a scimitar from his back scabbard (which he wields with two hands). Haglar does not call for help until he's reduced to half hit points or less, at which point the patrols in Rooms B69 and B70 are allowed Wisdom (Perception) checks to see if they hear him. Due to the nature of the walls in this room, the goblins suffer disadvantage to their checks.

**Treasure:** On the desk are notes and maps referring to various enemy patrols in this Section. The notes are written in a scrawling hand, and succeeding a DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to make any sense of them.

If deciphered, the notes mention an increase in bugbear raids, as well as an ill-fated raid by rebel goblins. The last patrol captured a rebel, who is now locked in Room B73. The goblin king has ordered that the rebel be sacrificed to their god in two days.

In addition to his personal possessions, Haglar carries a sturdy ring of three keys. One key leads to the locked door at Room B72. Another leads to Room B73. Finally, the third leads to the worg stables in Rooms B77 through B82.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the number of goblins affected by Commander of the King's Horde from 1d3 to 1d6. To decrease the challenge, lower it to one.

---

## B72. The Goblin Jail

The door to this room is locked. A DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check picks the door successfully. However, there is a 15% chance that the door is also barred, requiring a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check to break open (DC 22 when locked).

Strong chains and manacles hang from the walls and a cell is set in the northern wall. Faint, fearful moaning issues forth from the cell.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room serves as the detention area for anything captured by the goblin patrols in this Section of the dungeon. This jail is overseen by Haglar Quickwhip (room B71). If the PCs make too much noise in this room, allow Haglar a (DC 18) Wisdom (Perception) check to notice, and arrive 4d4 seconds later.

**Encounter Condition:** Drafty

**Tactics:** The jail is empty. The door to the north is sturdier than most but has a patchwork lock cut into the wood. It looks jury-rigged by crude hands as if a saw and hammer were the only available tools.

The small cell (Room B73) houses a lone goblin (**G'lp**). A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check hears his heavy breathing/moaning/weeping.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## B73. Captured Rebel

The door to this cell is locked, requiring a DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (or the key from Haglar's belt) to unlock.

Huddled far in the corner is a frightened goblin. He is startled by your presence and yelps when he notices you.

**Initial Attitude:** Friendly

**Encounter:** This wounded goblin, named **G'lp**, was part of a failed raiding party on the part of the rebel goblin factions. Once he has been assured that the patrols, especially Haglar, have been dealt with, he blubbers incoherently, attempting to explain the current situation and how the usurper who sits on the goblin throne has wronged his people.

If the PCs don't know what or who Haglar is, he assumes the hobgoblin is still alive and cries out for help (in goblin), in the hopes of currying favor with his jailer. Haglar arrives 1d3 rounds later.

The PCs make out that there is a deep schism between the goblins, and the majority of them worship a newfound god. The current goblin king, who is also the leader of their new religion, has formed an alliance with the hobgoblins and is training an army to conquer the entire Region in the name of his deity. Any goblins that do not follow his commands are considered traitors and hunted mercilessly. The lucky ones die in combat. The unfortunate ones are captured and sacrificed in the name of this new god.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** If the PCs release him, G'lp flees the area entirely, making his way back to the rebel encampments on the far side of the Region. If the PCs do not release G'lp, he curses the PCs vehemently, invoking the names of every stone spirit he can muster. If the PCs welcome him into their party, he joins, trying to lead the PCs to the rebels. Otherwise, he is glad to be a "part of the team" and does his best to carry his weight. Whenever the PCs enter a room with G'lp, there is a 35% chance that he's been here before and knows how to "bypass" the room.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## B74. Antechamber of the Goblin King

If the PCs killed Hammerfist in Room B85, he is not present here.

This large, rectangular room (almost a hallway) is polished brightly. Eighteen fierce-looking goblins, each wielding a spear, stare at you coldly. Behind them, a tall, wide-shouldered hobgoblin carries a fist-shaped mallet.

If the goblins heard the PCs coming, read this:

With quick precision, they form a tight phalanx and move with deadly intent. The hobgoblin rushes madly, swinging his mallet with abandon.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** As the PCs enter the antechamber, they are attacked by eighteen **goblin warriors** and the captain of the king's elite guard, a huge hobgoblin named **Hammerfist**. Because the goblins are training with Hammerfist, their adrenaline is up and the impending fight is just an excuse to cut loose.

After three rounds of combat, **Argliss** enters from Room B75, flanked by two **hobgoblin guards**. If the fight isn't going too poorly for his men, he orders his guardsmen to stand down and invites the PCs into his throne room. The goblin king is articulate and polite, unusual for a goblin of any stature.

> ### The Goblin King
>
> Some time ago the **doppelganger Argliss** entered the Region. He was amused by the goblinoids trapped here. Out of boredom, he assumed the guise of a goblin and slowly worked his way into the good graces of the reigning goblin king, Sug'kt. Soon he became a chief advisor. He relished the role of bringing a culture out of the shadows to suit his whims.
>
> When word of the new "deity" arrived, Argliss saw a chance to improve his position amongst the goblins. He recently discovered the goblin king kept a powerful artifact hidden in his possession. Wanting it for himself, Argliss knew he would have to be the goblin king's confidante. Hoping to ingratiate himself with the goblins, he urged the king to embrace this new deity. The goblin king was incensed. Sug'kt felt he alone was ruler of the goblins, as decreed by the ancient stone spirits his ancestors worshiped. Popular support was behind the new deity, however, and Argliss seized his chance to advance his position by staging a coup.
>
> He declared Sug'kt a heretic, sacrificed the former king, and claimed the throne in the name of the new god of the goblins, **Norendithas Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes**. Argliss began his quest to not only uncover the hidden artifact, but to establish his rule over the entire Region.
>
> Unable to locate the artifact, he enlisted the help of a halfling who had entered the Section (see The Halfling). Argliss believes that Bartleby will return the artifact to him, in exchange for the goblin's protection and any trinkets he may find. While he awaits Bartleby's success, he has made strides toward ruling the dungeon.
>
> Argliss approached the beleaguered hobgoblins, offering them a prime place in his empire. Wishing to seek revenge upon the bugbears that had tormented them for so long, the hobgoblins accepted his offer. They now serve as elite guards and trainers of the goblin army.
>
> Upon encountering the PCs, Argliss tries to ally with them. He feels their power and knows they could be very disruptive to his efforts. He is willing to assist the PCs in their mission, as long as they return the favor and help him wipe out the bugbears and rebel faction of goblins.
>
> If the PCs do not accept his offer, all goblins loyal to him attack the PCs on sight.
>
> **Tactics:** Argliss is not a fighter. In the event of conflict, he orders his guards to attack while he runs off. Once the battle is engaged he changes shape to something inconspicuous and flees the area, returning to his throne room.
>
> If Argliss is cornered and cannot escape, he uses the rod of wonder and necklace of fireballs liberally until he causes enough of a distraction that he can flee.

If more than five goblins have been slain, however, he directs the hobgoblins to join him as he bars the door and prepares for the PCs. In this case, the PCs are in for a tough fight. Additionally, if the PCs do not wish to speak with the goblin king, the battle continues until either the guards or the PCs are dead.

**Encounter Condition:** Fearless (save for the goblin king).

**Tactics:** These elite goblins are just now starting their training with Hammerfist. The others are either on patrol or standing guard in another area of the dungeon.

In combat, instead of swarming the PCs, they form up into ranks, six goblins abreast, three rows deep. They advance on the PCs stabbing the closest PCs with their spears. They hold their bucklers facing forward, offering more protection (+1 bonus to AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them, gaining attacks of opportunity as the PCs move into their threat range.

Hammerfist on the other hand, hunts the PCs. He does not draw attacks of opportunity if he can help it, but he does try to push past anyone who leaves an opening. Hammerfist, hates clerics and targets those openly displaying holy symbols. He is also fond of crippling attacks and targets PCs with little to no armor when he can.

**Treasure:** The weapon racks are filled with spears. All the spears are small, however, designed for goblins. Their size means for creatures larger than small size they lose reach and gain thrown (40/80).

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase each goblin's hit points by +5. To reduce the challenge of this encounter remove six goblins.

---

## B75. Throne Room of the Goblin King

If the PCs accepted the goblin king's offer to negotiate, read the following:

This room is large and opulently decorated. Hides from various animals are layered on the floor, while others hang as trophies or tapestries from the walls. Two large braziers cast a sinister, yet regal glow on a throne of bone and stone standing prominently in the room, and it is where the goblin king sits.

He wears a bright leather vest and pants. A velvet cloak hangs from his shoulders. On his head rests a light, silver crown, and he wields a multi-hued scepter in his left hand. "Welcome friends, I am Argliss, King of the Goblins and Voice of Norendithas Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes. The Stoneshaper has brought us together for great things I'm sure. Please, hear what I have to say," the goblin king intones as you approach him.

If the PCs declined the goblin king's offer to parlay, or have snuck in, read the following:

The room is large, and well-appointed for goblins but without the pomp and circumstance of the goblin king, his court, and his guards, it looks like any room that's been covered in hides. A pair of large braziers cast a ruddy glow about the room, playing off the brightly polished walls. In the center is a throne of rubble and bones, a scepter resting upon it.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** If the PCs choose to continue the battle in Room B74, this encounter does not happen and they are free to explore the room as long as they wish.

The goblin king, Argliss, who is interested in the PCs' services, informs them of the new destiny of the goblins. Their god, **Norendithas Stoneshaper the Quickthinking, Smiter of Foes**, has finally arrived and promises to lead them to power and glory. "Any who serve the will of the Stoneshaper shall be greatly rewarded, in this life and the next!" the goblin king proclaims.

The goblin king only wishes for more patsies to serve his whims. Argliss is very good at hiding this truth though; only a successful DC 24 Wisdom (Insight) check lets the PCs know the goblin king is being less than truthful.

If the PCs agree to assist the goblin king, he tasks them with killing the rebel chieftain **Guk** (Room B95). They must return with proof of his death. If they do so, the goblin king welcomes them as members of the glorious empire of the Stoneshaper.

Once the PCs agree to ally with the goblin king, the elite hobgoblin guard files out of the room and returns to their barracks (Room B84). Hammerfist snarls at the PCs one last time before he too leaves and returns to his quarters (Room B85).

If the PCs refuse the goblin king's offer, he becomes enraged. "None defy the will of the Stoneshaper!" he shouts. Hammerfist lets loose with a bellowing war cry and is ready to charge the PCs. The goblin king halts his advance however and offers the PCs one last chance to see the error of their ways and join him.

A second refusal is all it takes. "May the Stoneshaper have mercy on your wretched souls," the goblin king says as Hammerfist and the elite guard attack the PCs.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The goblin warriors move on Hammerfist's command. Instead of swarming the PCs, they form up into ranks, six goblins abreast, three rows deep. They advance on the PCs, stabbing the closest to them with their spears. They hold their bucklers facing forward, offering more protection (+1 bonus to AC) to the goblin on their left. The goblins allow the PCs to rush them, gaining attacks of opportunity as the PCs move into their threat range.

Hammerfist goes after the weakest PC first, targeting spellcasters first. He also has a fond hatred for clerics and abuses them at every turn. He fights as intelligently as possible, stepping back when overwhelmed and taking full advantage of prone PCs.

If the goblin king is in danger, he flees to Room B74, and from there heads to Room B77. In the meantime, he uses his rod of wonder on whatever PC presents the biggest threat and his necklace of fireballs if too many goblins fall.

**Treasure:** If the PCs choose not to listen to the goblin king, and he is forced to flee, he leaves behind his royal scepter (laying on his throne) on a failed DC 16 Intelligence save. The scepter is a rod of wonder.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add three fighter levels to Hammerfist. To reduce the challenge of this encounter, remove one fighter level from Hammerfist.

## B76. Private Room of the Goblin King

The door leading to Region A is locked and barred, requiring a DC 30 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, followed by a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check to open. A small chest rests against the door as well, making it difficult to open the door all the way.

The doors from Room B75 are also locked and require a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open. In both cases, the goblin king carries keys to these doors.

After you dispatch the last of the goblins, you enter this room, the private quarters of the goblin king, Argliss. The room is very befitting of a king. Exquisite hides are piled as a comfortable bed, while others adorn the walls as tapestries. A good-sized strongbox is tucked into the northeastern corner of the room.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** If the PCs made an alliance with the goblin king and attempt to enter this room, they are warned that it is off-limits. If they persist the goblin king calls off the alliance and orders his guards to attack the PCs. The goblin king flees before the PCs can capture or kill him, returning in 2d6 minutes with reinforcements to drive the PCs out.

This room is luxuriously furnished with a thick layer of hides forming a comfortable sleeping area in the northwestern corner. The walls are decorated with tapestries made of similar hides. They depict the conquests and glories of the new goblin king and his god.

A small chest is situated against the northeastern wall. A DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check is required to unlock it. It contains the room's treasure (see below).

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** +1 shortsword, +1 leather armor (made for a goblin), +1 buckler. It is possible the PCs may wish to take the hides as well for their own personal use, or for future sales. They are large, made of worg hide, and carrying more than one proves to be cumbersome.

**Scaling:** N/A

## B77. Entrance to the Worg Stables

The door to this room (leading from the eastern hall) is locked, requiring a successful DC 19 Dexterrity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. The door leading from Region A is also locked, requiring a DC 22 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.

Pungent smells and keening wails saturate the air. The floor is covered, stained, and scratched. Even the walls are not devoid of claw marks. Along the southern wall are a series of iron doors, much like cell doors. The room quiets for a brief moment, then it erupts into loud howls and barks. Whatever is in these cells, knows you're here.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** These cells are the goblins' worg stables, the home of their vicious worg mounts. This hallway leads to the "cells'' where the elite worg mounts are kept. The stables themselves are large. Most are noisy, except the one at the west end, which is deathly quiet. Due to their Scent ability, it is nearly impossible for the PCs to surprise the worgs in these cells.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises, Echoes 2, Unhallowed

**Tactics:** This series of cell doors are sturdy and are all locked. The keys to these doors are kept by Haglar (B71), the Goblin King's (B75) bodyguards, and a handful of elite goblins.

The "cells" were used (long ago) to house demons, an effect that has caused the worgs to become even more bestial than they already were.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## B78. Worg Stable

Four large wolves sleep comfortably in this cell. Despite the barking and howling coming from other cells, these animals are not as crazed. One of the wolves looks up as you enter the room but quickly lies back down again.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** These four **worgs** have just returned from a successful patrol and are tired. Although the PCs represent a threat, they are satiated from hunting and want to rest. The worgs have enough energy to defend themselves if the PCs attack them but suffer from a level of exhaustion.

**Encounter Condition:** Fearless, Unhallowed

**Tactics:** These worgs fight like a typical pack, tripping and grounding the weakest PC and then mauling them while prone. If a single PC gets separated from the party, or the PC attacks too quickly, the worgs surround and flank them.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, change the worgs' initiative roll to exactly 1 lower than the highest PC, allowing them to ambush the "impulsive PC." Alternately, add two worgs. To decrease the challenge, remove one worg.

---

## B79. The Black Worg

The barks issuing from this cell are louder than from any other cell. With a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check, the PCs can discern a single loud bark, deeper and more aggressive than any of the other cells.

From the darkness, a large black wolf stands at least five feet at the shoulder. Its powerful muscles ripple under its sleek, black coat. At first, it doesn't notice you. Suddenly its hackles raise, and it turns, snarling. With a mighty howl, it bursts free of its meager enclosure and leaps at you.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** A **black worg** (worg alpha) is stabled here. It is twice as large as any other worg in the goblin's possession. It is also twice as feral. Worgs may have some measure of intelligence, but this one is bestial. When the PCs enter the room it breaks free of its inadequate holding pen and lunges at the nearest one. The PCs have no choice but to defend themselves.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush, Distracting Noises, Echoes 2, Fearless, Unhallowed

**Tactics:** The black worg attacks like an animal, vicious and unrelenting. It uses its trip attack every round, taking advantage of weak PCs. It knows no fear and does not respond to pain.

Killing the black worg earns the ire of Hammerfist (Room B85) should he find out; he was breaking in the worg to be his personal mount. There is little choice for the PCs in this matter, however, and they must deal with Hammerfist's wrath. Any explanation the PCs offer is not good enough for the hobgoblin.

**Treasure:** The black worg wears a heavy leather collar, set with three discolored gems, none of which match. The collar is worth 25 gp to a jeweler who can salvage the stones.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two Hit Dice to the black worg. To reduce the challenge of this encounter, replace the black worg's stats with that of a worg.

## B80. Filthy Stable

The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.

A pack of four, miserable-looking wolves, larger than normal, are penned up in this stable. Whether they are being punished or neglected is difficult to say. They growl and snap at you, but otherwise remain behind their enclosure.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** Four **worgs** are being punished for disobeying their riders' instructions during a recent patrol. They do not attack the PCs first but defend themselves if provoked. While not chained, they lack the ability to open the locked door.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If a fight ensues, the worgs gang up on the weakest PC first followed by other opponents without visible metal armor. They concentrate all their attacks until the victim is down. Like all pack animals, the alpha male delivers the coup de grace before the pack moves on to the next PC. If the victim fails a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw their attacks knock creatures they damage prone.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, add one worg. To decrease the challenge, remove one worg.
