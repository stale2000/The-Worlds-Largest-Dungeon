## An Introduction to the World's Largest Dungeon

### History

Millennia ago, the Celestials built a great dungeon. Within it, the celestials erected mammoth walls, locks, doors, and traps. It warded off those who would enter but also walled in those who would escape: it was a dungeon larger than any ever known. Within it, the celestials imprisoned hellish undead, demonic beasts, and fiendish monstrosities.

The prison was a perfect construction. Dizzying mazes and complex traps designed to confuse and keep the prisoners inside. Before the first dwarf was born to sculpt stone, angels, and celestials carved a work of art that no one would ever see. Perfect in every detail, it would stand inviolate for thousands of years. But none can say why the gods ordered demons and liches to be entombed and not destroyed. The logic of their decision is beyond the intelligence of mortals, their plans an impenetrable fog of reasoning. In time, the gods would rue their mercy.

Centuries passed, and the prison remained unchanged. The champions who protected humanity from the liches and hezrou and pit fiends stood vigilant guard, ready to spend eternity in honor of the gods. But time passed over the celestials. The world forgot its heroes. Even the heavens turned a blind eye to the angels, inevitables, and guardians serving out their destiny entombed in the earth.

No one is sure how much time passed before an earthquake cracked the foundation of the dungeon. The rift spread for miles, nearly ripping the dungeon in two. Into the rift flowed lava, but it did not boil the occupants of the dungeon. The temperature rose beneath the earth, and the cold home of the unliving became capable of sustaining life.

It was not long before the derro came. They made their homes among the rocks and tombs. Many of the traps set throughout the dungeon had been triggered, and creatures that the celestials had sworn to entomb eternally had escaped. In time, more subterranean creatures would make their homes in the rock. All the while, celestials stood guard over the truest evils.

Then, another earthquake pushed jagged earth through the dungeon floor, destroying a large portion of its foundation. Driders and drow dug beneath the rock and rubble to make their homes. The same earthquake tore a hole in the ceiling, and flying beasts like the arrowhawk and belker perched on the highest plateaus of their underground sanctuary.

As the dungeon's population grew, so did the celestials' fear that mankind would be destroyed by its inhabitants. Two titans made the long journey to the mountain and stood guard at the entrance and exit to the tombs in eternal vigil.

Time passed. Few monsters made the climb down from the surface or pushed up from below. Only the strongest made a home in the debris of the prison. Eventually, more derro came, bringing other diggers with them. When they required more room, the derro dug deeper.

The burrowing derro caused a massive landslide, bringing thousands of pounds of earth and millions of gallons of water crashing in. Hundreds of derro and duergar died, and the survivors moved deeper into the earth. Enlisting every manner of enslavable race, the derro crossed a giant chasm and started digging again.

Within the last hundred years, the dungeon has seen unprecedented activity. Every manner of creature lives in the dungeon. An elder treant and its elven entourage have made a refuge in the westernmost portion, while the undead have remained entombed at the northernmost point since the dungeon's creation. The core of the dungeon (Regions F and G) show the greatest sign of conflict, with angels and devils waging a war that must end poorly. Lastly, the exit has seen a change of power that will stymie heroes who think they're "almost done."

The World's Largest Dungeon represents years of adventuring. Do not tread lightly.

## Facts About the Dungeon

The World's Largest Dungeon is malleable. It has been designed to serve your needs as a gamemaster, but this book is peppered with advice. Unless you are starting a fresh game world with fresh characters, you will have to do some work to wedge the dungeon into your setting.

The plan is for the dungeon to be in a mountainous region. It has been buried for countless years, and no humans have found it until now. There is a plot in Region A for bringing the PCs into the dungeon, but there are also 20 options on a chart on page 8. Tailor the story to your needs. And if you don't like a Region of the dungeon or want to start with a different area, skip what you don't like.

The maps don't even need to connect the way they are connected. You are welcome to move them around.

The dungeon has one entrance for our design purposes, but it can have any number of entrances you need. If you desire more entrances, they should be well hidden or even guarded by relevant creatures (kobolds near the front, winter wolves along the cold northeast section, and so on).

Because the northern reaches of the World's Largest Dungeon have access to the surface world, it should be in a remote area, lest adventurers know it is here all along.

A chasm filled with lava — filled with mephits — pushes through the earth beneath the Dungeon. It must have a beginning and end point, which you may need to explain for setting continuity, but you may simply decide it remains under the earth, pushing up under a lake or sea bed, warming the currents.

The monsters in the Dungeon do not have children. There are no locations with baby ogres or yuan-ti eggs. If this does not mesh with your vision of a harmonious dungeon, we apologize. Killing children, whatever their species, faction, or identification, is not heroic.

### Ecology

Taken at face value, a dungeon housing over 1,000 monsters is going to need a food source other than "the titan just eats the elves." In all honesty, we don't expect this adventure to be run from beginning to end. While it has been designed to be just that — the world's largest dungeon — and it has a reason for being here, such an undertaking would break even the bravest GM and players.

Therefore, it is our contention that lichen, rats, goblins, and dire boars make for an excellent food chain. In the lower levels of the Dungeon, goblins hunt the rats and eat them, and someone eats the goblins. Who? That's up to you. As for the higher levels of the Dungeon, drop in a farm of dire boars, and you're all set. Like all pigs, they'll eat whatever slop you serve them, and chances are dire boars taste just as good as their real-world counterparts.

If your style of play requires more explanation beyond that, there are a few "magical" answers to help quell your need for realism.

- Underground springs of water provide all manner of sustenance. Time moves slowly here, so when most creatures do drink or eat, it nourishes them longer.
- Because of the presence of the celestials, no one needs to eat. That's why it's such a hospitable place for monsters: there is less competition over resources.
- Races trade with the fey. In exchange for not wiping them out, the nymphs and dryads provide edible lichen and other food. After all, if you eat a treant today, you'll be hungry tomorrow, and then what?
- At high enough levels, clerics can make food from nothing. Certainly, a goblin shaman could summon a plate of grubs for his followers.
- The steam mephits provide magical sustenance to all who stand on the rocks of the Dungeon. (We don't know exactly how that works.)
- Certain races, like the driders, are experimenting with creature cross-breeding. Maybe chaos beasts or free-range chuul are tasty.
- Cut the Dungeon into bite-size morsels and run it as separate lairs, each with its own passage to the outside.
- Perhaps intelligent monsters are more nutritious.

### Prison Architecture

The Dungeon was built to jail undead and demons, not to be comfortable. There are no barracks, kitchens, or anything resembling "living" quarters. Squatters have made do with whatever they've found here.

Makeshift barracks do not afford the comforts of home. The PCs won't find a logical pattern here.

After a few weeks of exploring, the PCs may start coming to their own conclusions about the Dungeon. If not, they can always run into a lantern archon.

### Lantern Archons

One of the PCs' best friends are the helpful **lantern archons** that may appear throughout the Dungeon. These celestials were assigned to know everything about their own dungeon, and some have survived to the present day. Each lantern archon knows why its Region of the Dungeon was created but is ignorant of conditions on other maps. These archons are a great way to dole out information to the PCs.

Lantern archons can be found anywhere the GM likes. They know many things they shouldn't, like PC names, recent plunder, total dead in the area, and so on. They are not there to tell the PCs what lies beyond a door but rather to point them to the Dungeon's major plots. Their original purpose was to watchdog the Regions, but since the earthquake, each archon has grown sullen (and perhaps a little lonely), taking on a personality of its own.

All of the lantern archons believe that Region O is the only exit to the Dungeon and that Barcellus (Room O59), a titan loyal to the celestials, guards it. They do not know that Barcellus has been replaced. See Region O for more details.

Feel free to give each archon a unique voice. Alternately, ignore them altogether and have the PCs find their way through the mess.

## The Dungeon Environment

### Scale

Scale is a bit of a mixed bag here. In the original printing, the maps needed to be at least six feet tall (marketing demanded it) when fastened to the wall. As such, there were limits as to how big the Region maps could be. The original intent was for the dungeon to be many square miles. But if you examine the map, it's a lot less than that.

As such, the maps were initially designed to be 5-ft. by 5-ft. squares, which was also the baseline for the third edition. However, making them 10 ft. by 10 ft. squares, in fact, gets the size of the dungeon closer to the original mark. However, that makes a lot of these hallways gigantic. So, there are a few suggestions on how to apply scale to these maps.

- The simplest answer is the maps are not to scale. They give a general idea of the placement and size of a hallway or room, but the GM is free to mix things up however and whenever. When the mapping doesn't line up, that's on par with what the celestials intended.
- All of the squares are 5 by 5 or 10 by 10. Done. Don't worry about it.
- The space under the mountain does not match the space on top of the mountain. It doesn't have to make sense. It's magic.
- Region H is problematic when you try to ascertain how remote this prison is. If the PCs never visit Region H, it is irrelevant. Alternatively, Region H is 10 miles east of where it appears on the map. Problem solved.
- The passageways between Regions (maps) are very long. Add a few hundred feet here and there.

Doing any of these requires some different visualization, but none of it reduces the dungeons' playability. There are still rooms, doors, hallways, monsters, traps, and the occasional treasure.

### Sight

Keep in mind that the Dungeon is completely dark. Except where noted, there are no sources of light anywhere inside the Dungeon. This environment does not present a problem for most creatures, who rely on **darkvision** or **blindsight** to find their way. Of course, while darkvision or blindsight allows the creatures to see, there are distance limits.

Unless the party is composed entirely of races that have darkvision, the PCs must rely on light sources to find their way. Aside from illumination problems (torches burn out, light spells end), having to rely on light sources presents a huge handicap in sections where other creatures can see in the dark. Outside, a torch can literally be seen from miles away on a moonless night. Inside a dungeon, low ceilings and tight corridors reduce torch visibility to 100 ft. or so. Nonetheless, any attempts at stealth, including surprise, are ruined by a simple candle as watchful creatures likely spot the light source long before it becomes visible.

Nothing attracts unwanted attention in darkness like a source of light. Regions H, K, L, M, the eastern edge of N, and O all have slightly different lighting conditions. Higher ceilings, holes in the mountain tops, and other conditions make these Regions different from the claustrophobic tunnels of the remaining dungeon. Review these chapters and make sure the PCs understand how high the ceilings are.

### Sound

Sound doesn't travel as far as the PCs might expect. While the Dungeon is not soundproof, the walls are very thick, muffling the screams of the demons in their cells. Wards were added to soften their annoying, persistent echoes. Years of neglect have caused these wards to warp, creating an unplanned new effect. Sound is unpredictable.

This means a lot to clever GMs. If the PCs are extra quiet, perhaps a single breath gets funneled down a quarter mile of corridor, alerting everyone of the PCs' presence. Or an epic battle in a room two doors away goes unheard. Echoes from the farthest reaches of the Dungeon could be heard at the entryway, and the PCs' footfalls could go unnoticed by someone right in front of them.

Don't be afraid to use this to your advantage or to help low-level PCs sneak past larger adversaries. Drop hints of things to come or disguise an ambush waiting to happen. It is important to note that Regions H, K, L, and O do not follow standard rules regarding magic, wards, and — in this case — sound. Feel free to apply these concepts as you see fit.

### Traps

While most of the original magical traps have long since failed or been destroyed when the creatures imprisoned here escaped, the celestials maintained a number of other traps up until their departure to Regions E and G. Although they are usually in areas of strategic importance, traps are occasionally found in unexpected places.

Many traps were designed only to paralyze the undead and demonic forces that could not be destroyed. Others produce cold and/or fire depending on whether they were designed to kill devils or undead. Acid and sonic traps were effective as well, bringing many creatures to their knees. However, because of the nature of the undead and demonic beasts, someone always had defenses against something. As a result, a variety of traps were made, many of them magically capable of resetting themselves.

Over the centuries, many creatures have stumbled through these corridors, tripping glyphs, spells, and fire traps. The hardest ones to spot have already been tripped, and some never reset. The ones that have a marking were circumnavigated once the first hobgoblin was turned into a rat or doused with flaming oil. The easiest ones to spot have been avoided. That said, traps can be anywhere the GM wants to place them. Doors, columns, and secret panels could be trapped. Anything a demon might fiddle with to escape the dungeon could be trapped. Feel free to add all manner of non-lethal traps whenever the whim strikes.

**Note:** Corridor traps slow down gameplay. A project of this type requires them to some degree but be merciful and give the PCs a chance to spot them passively without the rogue calling out for searches every 20 feet.

### Other

Because the original builders had little need for creature comforts, the Dungeon has little in the way of furniture or standard dungeon decor. The occasional workbench or forge might exist, though. These Regions are geologically unstable. So, while an actual collapse is not going to happen with the PCs inside the dungeon (unless you want one), the occasional rumbles and tremors are common. These rumbles can be anything from a minor nuisance to a real hazard. If the random encounter tables do not include them, feel free to add them when things are slow.

### Interior Doors and Walls: The Simple Answer

Unless otherwise stated, all walls are stone, and all doors are iron.

**Iron Door:** 3 in. thick; AC 19; hp 30; open lock DC 15.

**Stone Wall:** 3 ft. thick: AC 17; hp 50; break DC 30.

Due to the Prison's superstructure, even a small section of broken stone causes no lasting damage. Only a force on par with a cataclysmic earthquake can damage the foundation.

### Interior Doors and Walls: Locked Doors

A number of doors in the Dungeon are locked. This makes the Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) proficiency very handy. In fact, PCs shouldn't enter the Dungeon without a rogue and a set of thieves' tools (lockpicks). As a GM, you have to decide if you want certain doors to be easier or harder to open. Apply advantages and disadvantages however you see fit.

### Interior Doors and Walls: Standard Doors

Unless stated otherwise in the Room or area text, a standard dungeon door conforms to the following rules.

- If there is no description of a door, it is closed but unlocked. How long and tedious would this be if they were all locked?
- It is made of wood and bound with iron.
- **Iron Door:** 3 in. thick; AC 15, damage threshold 12; hp 90; break DC 21; open lock DC 15.
- It opens in one direction only but has pull rings on both sides. All doors push open into the Rooms from the hallway or from the previous Room unless otherwise noted. In case of a conflict, the decision is up to the GM.
- Although heavy, it is well anchored on common hinges and can be opened by any creature of Small size or larger simply by leaning on it. Doors can only be pulled by a creature able to grasp the ring. Creatures of Tiny size or smaller do not have the mass to pull open a door, even if they have the strength.
- Doors are neutrally hinged and do not swing open or close on their own. A closed door stays closed, and an open door stays open unless purposely shut.
- There is roughly a half-inch gap between the bottom of the door and the floor, allowing air, light, noise, and smells to escape. Most prison/vault doors are sealed completely.

### Interior Doors and Walls: Secret Doors

Unless stated otherwise in the text, a secret door conforms to the following rules.

- If there is no description of the door, it is closed and of stone or whatever material the wall is made of.
- **Stone Door (stone wall section):** 3 ft. thick; hardness 20: hp 200: break DC 28.
- It pivots on a central, vertical axis by being pushed on one or the other end. Because they are much heavier than standard dungeon doors, secret doors require a successful DC 15 Strength check to push open or closed, and the following special size modifiers apply: Gargantuan +12, Huge +8, Large +4, Medium +0, Small -4, Creatures of Tiny size or smaller do not have the mass to push open a secret door, no matter how strong they are. In addition to these modifiers, any creature that is on more than two legs or is otherwise exceptionally stable gains a +4 modifier.
- Unless noted, discovering it requires a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check. In more advanced regions, this number may be as high as 20 or 25, per the GM's discretion.
- Unless noted, it has no locking mechanisms and thus cannot be locked, nor does it have a return mechanism. Secret doors remain open if opened or closed if closed.
- They are six feet high by seven feet wide. When fully open, secret doors are completely perpendicular to the wall. There is roughly three feet of maneuvering space between the secret door and the wall. This is large enough for a single creature of Medium size to squeeze through on either side simultaneously; creatures of Large size or larger usually cannot fit through such a space (although whether they actually can or not is ultimately the GM's call and depends on the physical characteristics of the creature). The door sits one foot off the ground on a threshold to allow for the pivot, a fact that also makes it more difficult to detect.
- Secret doors are built to very tight tolerances. There is a slight gap at the top and bottom through which air or noise might pass. Because of the thickness of the secret door, this gap is not large enough to allow light through.
- Pushing a secret door open causes the stone to scrape slightly and makes the same amount of noise as a person in medium armor trying to stealth (DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check to detect the noise).

Some encounters have special conditions or rules that make it harder for the PCs to defeat the monsters. Some are contingent upon room conditions, magical effects, or sometimes sheer game balance. If they are hurting your games, ignore them. They are here to add elements to combat the PCs cannot plan for. Anyone who wants to kill an orc already knows their armor class and hit points, but what if they can't plan for certain bonuses or tactical benefits?

After all, monsters don't want to die. They will do everything in their power to stay alive. They fight from vantage points; they ambush the PCs when they can; they use numbers to their advantage; they flee or surrender when death is imminent. And since the monsters aren't stupid, be prepared to kick the PCs around a little until they learn this. And if that doesn't work, add a few Encounter Conditions of your own.

### Ceilings

The dungeon ceiling is sometimes as low as 10 ft. and sometimes as high as 50 ft. (or more). Each Room and hallway is different. The GM may decide how tall each Room is or roll once per Region, Section, or Room to determine the ceiling height.

If you need details, consider rolling for each Room. Or just roll when you think it will be relevant.

| D20 | Height |
|:---:|:-------|
| 1-5 | 10 ft. |
| 6-10 | 15 ft. |
| 11-14 | 20 ft. |
| 15-16 | 25 ft. |
| 17 | 30 ft. |
| 18 | 40 ft. |
| 19 | 50 ft. |
| 20 | 2d6×10 ft., or 1d20×5 ft. |

Outside the "dungeon" proper, where the stonework juts out from the earth, the Regions are more cavernous. In such places, the ceilings rise as high as four miles.

### Teleportation and Extra-Dimensional Travel

The walls of a prison are useless when its inhabitants can just phase out of existence and reappear on any plane they wish. The celestial knew this and surrounded the prison with a **null field**, negating extra-dimensional travel and teleportation. Any magic that allows the PCs or creature to gate, jump, or phase from place to place is negated. Creatures that have teleported into the dungeon (accidentally) find they cannot escape.

Since the earthquakes, pockets have developed throughout the complex where the null field has weakened or disappeared completely. The text explains exactly where, but Regions H, K, L, and O are the weakest in this regard. Additionally, some maps, such as A, E, F, and N, have teleportation built into their design. The maze-like nature of Regions E and F makes the random teleporters that much more devastating.

The GM may decide that creatures like barghests, shadows, blink dogs, and so on have limited range of motion on the ethereal or shadow planes, but they can never entirely escape the prison. Spells like *dimension door*, if allowed, only work to line of sight or 100 feet (whichever is less). Bags of holding, portable holes, and the like lose their link temporarily with the dimension in question. Stored items inside a bag of holding cannot be accessed, and items added fill the bag as though they were a normal item.

## Experience Points and Treasure

Let us explain some of the logic before getting into the advice.

From beginning to end, this dungeon has over 1,600 encounters. Using the logic of 15 encounters = one level of advancement, the characters would reach level 107 when they finally exited the dungeon. And Dungeons and Dragons doesn't go to level 107. Nor was either edition designed that way. That means that XP and Treasure cannot be handed out at the same rate as a typical dungeon.

You're probably not going to like this, and certainly the players won't, but this is an eventuality of something called the World's Largest Dungeon. There are solutions, but again, these are only highly suggested. We can't hover over your game table and make sure you're doing it right.

**Level advancement should happen at milestones.** You know when the PCs have cleared a dungeon one-third of the way. Grant them a level increase, and don't think too much about it. Give out XP as normal, as you like, but only use the map Regions that advance at the same rate as the PCs. If the PCs are level 7 when they exit Region A, then Regions B and E should be removed from the dungeon, leaving the PC to advance to C, F, or I.

Instead of tackling it in one big go, just run each Region as a stand-alone adventure. Regardless, each Region tells you the levels the PCs should be for them.

The same goes for treasure. The dungeon purposely has scant amounts of gold and magic items. There are so many routes for the PCs to take and so much advancement that could happen, the PCs would be running around with 10 +3 swords if we followed the regular flow of magic items. As such, the GM will need to hand out trinkets and prizes here and there, roughly one-third as often as normal.

**Note:** There is some treasure here, but it is rare.

Region A has a built-in story about how the PCs are roped into this adventure. However, you may decide to start somewhere else, or you don't like that story because it requires a little bit of front-loading. Either way, the following chart is a quick-start way to have the PCs inside the dungeon in no time.

### Quick-Start Reason

Alternatively, if the players know that you bought this book, tell them to equip themselves for a long journey and pick a mission from the list below.

| D20 | Mission |
|:---:|:--------|
| 1 | Glory. |
| 2 | Treasure. |
| 3 | Glory and treasure. |
| 4 | A punishment. |
| 5 | A tournament. |
| 6 | A holy mission. |
| 7 | A rescue mission goes horribly wrong. |
| 8 | The death of the titan marks the end of an age. Now it's the time for heroes. The doors are open. What are you waiting for? |
| 9 | Throw the PCs a curveball. Take them through Module B2, and have the rubble in Room 51 lead to Room A1 of the World's Largest Dungeon. |
| 10 | It's time to save the day! |
| 11 | You just spent a bundle on these books and you're going to play it, whether the PCs like dungeon crawls or not! |
| 12 | It's what the Knights of the Dinner Table would do. |
| 13 | It's what Igor would do. It must be mine! |
| 14 | Because if the World's Largest Dungeon was in your backyard, you'd grab a shovel, throw on some armor, and pack a lunch. |
| 15 | You just started college, and you need something to do for the next 4 years. |
| 16 | There's always room for Orcs! |
| 17 | It's finally in 5th edition format. |
| 18 | I can't believe you're still reading this list. |
| 19 | Region A is so much better now. |
| 20 | Seriously. Stop reading. |

Each map (or Region) has a theme. Divided by obstacles, territorial markings, secret doors etc., Regions can be divided into separate adventures or linked in one grand campaign. While each chapter explains its role, this is a short overview of each section.

---

## Basic Overview

**Region A:** Orcs, kobolds, and extraplanar creatures fight for territory. At the heart of the conflict is a wererat bent on controlling the entire Region. This introduction suggests to the PCs that something is going on in the prison. *Levels 1 to 3.*

**Region B:** A series of traps guard a fractured goblin empire. Hobgoblins, bugbears, blink dogs, and a false king. *Levels 4 to 6.*

**Region C:** Almost as chaotic as it is ordered, Region C unites many classic dungeoneering themes: traps, puzzles, and unique monsters. Region C is also a dead end, and unless the PCs recover the special key in Room C105, their trip here will go for naught. A black dragon trapped inside the maze and an ancient spectre make up two of the Region's finales. *Levels 7 to 9.*

**Region D:** One of the most important plots of the entire complex, the derro are the source of most problems in this dungeon. Now, a xill and his minions have enslaved dwarves, duergar, derro, grimlocks, and all manner of burrowing creatures to free an entombed evil. *Levels 14 to 18.*

**Region E:** One of a handful of celestial outposts in the Dungeon, the inevitables and guardians struggle for "authority" while monsters from Region J and the outermost portions of Region E break down their defenses. A number of creatures in this Region (insects, shadows, etc.) reduce the PCs' ability scores with their poisonous/draining attacks. Clerics will need spells like *lesser restoration* to survive the journey. *Levels 4 to 6.*

**Region F:** The most complex maze in the Dungeon, this Region is controlled by three opposing minotaur tribes, each being played against the other by a manipulative rakshasa-medusa team. Randomly teleporting gates make this Region nearly impossible to map. *Levels 7 to 9.*

**Region G:** The heart of the Dungeon and the most important struggle to save the PCs' world from extinction, Region G is the location of the final battle between the angels and demons. *Levels 9 to 11.*

**Region H:** Elf guardians and dedicated fey stand vigil around the "first tree," fallen into the Dungeon a few centuries ago. This is the most roleplaying-intensive Region. Here, the PCs can affect the Dungeon on a different level than the high-fantasy conclusions of Regions D, G, and N. *Levels 11 to 13.*

**Region I:** Tied to Map M, this Region is home to all the aberrations and "things that should not be." Concerned that the creatures could escape into Region E, the inevitables built wards to keep them in, but the tide of war slowly pushes against the PCs. *Levels 7 to 9.*

**Region J:** Based on dungeon crawls of old, this Region has puzzles, trapped statues, and tribes of monsters living elbow-to-elbow. With a nearly impossible finale, the Region will have PCs visiting again and again. *Levels 13 to 15.*

**Regions K and L:** These two Regions are intricately linked. Another by-product of the derro dig, this lake and adjoining swamp are the result of the landslide that dropped the two-mile-high ceiling into the Dungeon. Throw Region H in for a complete campaign adventure all its own. *Levels 11 to 13 and 13 to 15.*

**Region M:** Tied to Region I, Region M is the most conflicted of the maps. Drider masters perform horrible experiments on their drow slaves, tossing the aberrant remains into Region I. An exit to the mountain peaks above the Dungeon promises escape for those who can fly, but the cloud giants and flying beasts that control this Region have their own plans. *Levels 9 to 12.*

**Region N:** The largest and most impenetrable part of the Dungeon, the Tomb of the Unliving houses a three-way war between a lich, a mummy lord, and a ghost. Millennia of war have sculpted the landscape of this tomb, but none of these beasts have yet succeeded in releasing the terrible World Eater. *Levels 14 to 18.*

**Region O:** The climax to the Dungeon holds yet another twist. While the PCs may or may not know about the titan guarding the exit, the frost giants have enslaved the Region's occupants and taken control of the exit. They are not pushovers, and PCs thinking the undead were the final piece of the puzzle are in for a rude awakening. Because the PCs can race to the end, this Region covers *Levels 16 to 20.*

## Reading the Encounters

Each encounter is written in the same general format. Each opens with the number and name of the Room followed by pertinent information on running the encounter.

If there is specific information about the door or entrance to the Room that GMs should be aware of before the PCs enter, it can be found before the Read Aloud Text. Additionally, if there is a trap or something of note before the door, it is mentioned here. Some encounters happen in hallways, so be alert for them.

**Read Aloud Text.** It is recommended that the GM paraphrase or relay this information in his own voice, rather than read it aloud verbatim. This text relays to the players what they see, hear, and sense about the environment.

**Initial Attitude.** Attitudes for NPCs and monsters are Hostile, Unfriendly, Indifferent, Friendly, and Helpful. Few in this dungeon are Helpful. Hostile attitudes are hard to change, and monsters that are assigned to guard duty rarely change their minds about attacking.

**Encounter.** This is the meat of each Room, and includes the Room's history, details of the environment, monsters, traps, and so on. If a Room is completely empty, there is still a short description to give the GM something to improvise. If a monster or NPC is present, its hit points are listed. If the encounter refers to creatures from another part of the dungeon, it lists the Room they are from.

**Encounter Condition.** This is a special section. Written in shorthand, these notes point the GM to the charts explaining exactly how to conduct the battle. Not every encounter has a special condition, but feel free to add them to taste. Sometimes Encounter Conditions exist for encounters that are not violent. Details are still provided should a fight break out, or should the PCs try to sleep in a haunted chamber.

**Tactics.** Sometimes generic, other times Room specific, the tactics of a given monster are explained here. Sometimes the Tactics section helps a GM understand the contents of the Room, how to open a secret door, or what the best course of action is. Tactics is a catch-all when the Encounter and Treasure sections don't fit.

**Treasure.** Be careful not to read this aloud until the PCs have taken time to search the Room. Because there are over 1,600 Rooms in the Dungeon, no matter how much or how little treasure we assigned, it was going to be the wrong amount. Carefully weigh whether or not the PCs need another +1 longsword; would the campaign be better served with a potion of healing instead? Don't be afraid to give out less treasure at the start of a Region, anticipating greater rewards at the end.

**Scaling.** Each encounter with a monster or trap includes tips on how to make the encounter easier or harder. The GM should feel free to ignore this section or embellish each encounter as he sees fit.

The GM is always free to increase DCs. Increasing the DC is as simple as saying "the stonework is very dense", or "the pervading darkness and low ceilings make it hard to see."

This book is a great big toolbox, and you are the craftsman.

## Encounter Conditions

Some encounters have special conditions or rules that make it harder for the PCs to defeat the monsters. Bear in mind that the monsters don't want to die; they will do everything in their power to stay alive. They fight from vantage points; they ambush the PCs when they aren't looking; they use numbers to their advantage; and they flee or surrender when death is imminent.

None of the monsters in this dungeon are stupid. Be prepared to kick the PCs around a little until they learn this. And if that doesn't work, add a few Encounter Conditions of your own.

Encounter Conditions listed in [brackets] are not automatic. Some are optional while others are contingent upon something in the encounter. Read the Encounter thoroughly to note the difference.

**Ambush:** The monsters have advantage on all Stealth checks prior to Initiative.

**Ambush (darkness):** The monsters have advantage on all Stealth checks prior to Initiative and attack light sources from a distance and then attack the PCs from darkness, taking advantage of their darkvision.

**Bog:** Area is considered difficult terrain. Dexterity checks and saves are made at disadvantage. Every torch or other flame-based light source has a 50% chance of going out; roll once for each source at some point during the encounter. If someone carrying such a light source goes prone the light source is automatically extinguished.

**Concealment:** Monsters in the Room are considered lightly obscured unless they are adjacent to a PC. While obscured they have the benefits of half cover.

**Concealment (total):** Monsters in the Room are considered heavily obscured unless they are adjacent to an PC. While obscured they have the benefits of three-quarters cover.

**Cover:** Monsters in this Room maintain full cover until they are adjacent to a PC. While in full cover, they have advantage on Dexterity saving throws and cannot be targeted by attack rolls.

**Cover (soft):** As Cover, but the cover does not grant advantage to Dexterity saving throws.

**Cover (total):** As Cover, but unless adjacent to a PC, monsters have three-quarters cover while adjacent to cover, regardless of PC sight lines.

**Cursed X:** Something isn't right about this Room. Its inhabitants are slightly unhinged or its walls seem to sag with an undefinable sadness. The longer PCs spend in this Room, the harder it is for them to leave. Increase the DC of all Wisdom and Charisma saves by X while in this Room. Monsters or PCs already suffering from madness do not suffer this penalty.

**Deep Darkness:** This Room is cast in perpetual magical darkness that cannot be dispelled. Torches and lanterns give off ½ their normal light and magical light requires a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or it is extinguished.

**Deep Silence:** This Room is cast in perpetual magical silence, as per the *silence* spell, that cannot be dispelled.

**Desecration X:** Add X to undead saves against effects that Turn Undead.

**Diseased (Name) X:** For every minute the PCs spend in this Room, they must succeed at a DC X Constitution saving throw or contract the named disease. Even diseases that normally are only contracted through ingestion or injury can be contracted in this Room.

**Distracting Noises:** There are noises in the darkness that cannot be explained, Nonetheless, they can affect the wandering minds of PCs. Similar to Echoes, this Room also imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom and Dexterity saving throws, as well as Concentration and Perception checks. PCs must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution check in order to gain the benefits of Short or Long Rests in this Room.

**Distracting Visions:** Something is waiting in the darkness, or the shadows play strangely on the walls. While in this Room, the PCs suffer Disadvantage on Initiative rolls and Attacks of Opportunity. PCs must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution check in order to gain the benefits of Short or Long Rests in this Room.

**Drafty:** Open flames, such as torches, each have a 50% chance of being extinguished at some point while in this room.

**Echoes X:** A great deal of noise and distraction increases the DC of all Perception checks by X.

**Extreme Cold:** Anyone remaining in this Room for more than 1 minute begins to suffer the effects of cold. Casting spells in the cold is difficult: teeth chatter and fingers shake. Casting a spell in this Room requires a successful Constitution check (DC 8 + the spell's level). The cold can be magical or natural.

**Extreme Heat:** Anyone remaining in this Room for more than 1 minute must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of exhaustion. PCs in medium or heavy armor have disadvantage on the roll. The heat can be magical or otherwise. This stacks with other sources of exhaustion, but can only add up to 3 points (4 for PCs wearing heavy armor) and fades after 30 minutes outside of Extreme Heat.

**Fear X:** An inexplicable pallor of evil permeates this Room. PCs must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to X) or be frightened until they leave the room.

**Fearless:** Monsters and NPCs are immune to the Frightened condition, do not negotiate, and do not flee. Effects like *dissonant whispers* still deal damage but do not force the target to flee. Undead cannot be Turned, but on a failed save still suffer damage equal to the level of the cleric.

**Flooded:** These Rooms have become flooded by a higher water table or some magical effect. Area is considered difficult terrain. Ranged Attacks and Dexterity checks and saves are made at disadvantage. Every torch or other flame-based light source has a 50% chance of going out; roll once for each source at some point during the encounter. If someone carrying such a light source goes prone the light source is automatically extinguished.

**Fog X:** Everything in the Room X feet or further away is considered heavily obscured.

**Hallowed X:** This Room is holy. Clerics and Paladins gain X bonus to all Charisma based skill checks and undead and fiends have disadvantage on all saving throws.

**Haunted:** Rest is impossible. PCs can spend hit dice during a rest to regain hit points, but otherwise gain no benefits from resting.

**Hazardous Footing X:** The floor is covered in debris, rocks, glass, or sharp objects, or it otherwise impedes movement. PCs moving more than half their speed must succeed at a DC X Dexterity check or take 1d4 damage for each 5 ft. they move that round. Small and Tiny creatures have advantage on the Dexterity check.

**Invisible:** For some magical reason, the monsters in the Room gain the benefits of invisibility until they take an Action (attacking, casting a spell, etc.) that removes this benefit.

**Negative Energy:** Undead heal 1 hit point per hour in this Room. PCs lose 1 hit point per minute in this Room.

**Poor Footing X:** All (ground-based) monsters and PCs have disadvantage on melee attacks unless they succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10 + X).

**Positive Energy:** PCs heal 1 hit point per hour in this Room. Undead suffer 1 hit point of damage per minute in this Room.

**Safe:** This Room is generally safe and might be a good place to rest. Reduce the chance of an encounter here to 1/6th the normal rate of Random Encounters for the Section (e.g. if Random Encounters are rolled every hour, they are rolled every 6 hours in this Room).

**Smoke:** The air in this Room is thick with an unbreathable smoke, either from magic use or a recent fire. A character who breathes smoke must make a Constitution saving throw each round (DC 13, +1 per previous check) or be Incapacitated until the start of their next turn as they spend the round choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Many creatures that do not breathe (demons, aberrations, etc.) use Smoke to their advantage.

**Spell Resistance:** This Room is guarded by wards and spells that dispel all magic cast within it. All occupants have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Stagnant Air:** As Smoke, but instead of taking damage, a character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds is considered Poisoned. Many creatures that do not breathe (demons, aberrations, etc.) use Stagnant Air to their advantage.

**Submerged:** The Room is completely underwater and the PCs must swim across it. The PCs must have some way to breathe water to remain in this Room, or they will begin to drown.

**Tremors X:** A tremor shakes the Dungeon, dropping stones on the PCs. PCs must succeed at a DC X Dexterity saving throw or suffer 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage at a random point in the Encounter.

**Unhallowed:** This Room is unholy. Clerics and Paladins have disadvantage on all skill checks.

## Summoning Monsters

It's bound to happen. A PC realizes that nothing in this dungeon ever leaves. The magic of the prison holds it on this plane. "I can spend 14 days summoning badgers for the big battle, right?"

We don't feel good about the answer GMs are going to give the PCs on this one, but here goes. PCs shouldn't have access to summoning spells. It's game breaking. We can't eliminate conjuration magic entirely, even though, by the backstory of the Dungeon, it shouldn't work at all. Now. There are workarounds. Summoned monsters are pseudo-magical and turn to goo or something when the duration expires. But that's more explanation headache on your part, should the PCs push back on the ruling.

There is one way to stop the wizard with 400 badgers around her, and that is to eliminate control of the monsters once the summoning spell wears off. The badgers turn on the wizard or run off into the dungeon on their own.

And do we have to say this? Summoning monsters to turn around and kill for XP is worth nothing.

Our suggestion is to not have summoning work at all. Tell the players they can choose other conjuration spells, but anything that brings a creature into the dungeon does not work.

Demons and devils still retain their demon-summoning abilities. This flies in the face of what we've just said about summoning spells, but there's a game balance reason for this. The XP and challenge rating of the demons is based on their ability to summon allies. For some creatures, it's all they have.

But if they can summon other demons and devils, why haven't they summoned more to them to help break out of their cells?

### Demonic Summoning

Demons are unpredictable. They don't follow orders well, and no one needs sixteen lemures hanging around and screwing up their master plans. Additionally, there is limited space in these cells, and summoning another demon into your Room is just stupid. Some demons are already elbow to elbow. And while demons feed on chaos, one could guess that after 4,000 years of being trapped inside a dungeon cell next to Bob the Eternal Jerk, "summoning" Rob the Endless Moron is going to make the scenery so much worse.

Most of the devils are trapped in Region D, where there is no more room. Also, the devils in the Dungeon have an attitude problem. They often don't work well with others and know that another devil of equal power is going to rival it. Finally, imps are useless in high-powered regions of the Dungeon. Summoning one as a scout would be like delivering a free pizza to your neighbor.

## Making It Work

It's all about the fun. While a great story will always be remembered, a series of great evenings is all we could ever ask from a product of this scope. We encourage GMs to make things challenging, heroic, and epic, but above all, fun. A lot of people put a lot of work into this book, and if you don't gain some kind of enjoyment from it, then we've failed.

And we don't like to fail.

So sit back, relax, and enjoy what will be the best (and longest) gaming experience of your lives.

## Map Zero

The following locations do not exist on any map. Rooms Z1 and Z2 appear before the PCs enter the tunnel. Included below is also location Y1, the magma flow that cuts through the Dungeon.

Lastly, Rooms W1 through W20 are empty Room descriptions that the GM can swap in and out throughout the Dungeon.

### Z1 - Z2: A Titan Dies

Depending on how the PCs find out about the Dungeon, these encounters may not be necessary. They are provided for convenience and present important themes for GMs running the entire campaign.

There are no Random Encounters in this Section.

#### Z1: The Titan

> As you climb the mountain, rocks and debris slow your ascent. Numerous tracks of different creatures ascend the hillside. Some you recognize. Others...
>
> The climb levels off as you get closer to the cave mouth. You see a humanoid figure the size of a galleon lying on the ground at the cave opening. As you get closer, you can see that death has taken him. Despite his obviously decomposed state, the man does not exude the odor of decay. There are no signs of a struggle. Who was he, and how did he die?

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The body of Breysus, a dead titan, lies at the opening of the World's Largest Dungeon. For centuries, he stood guard at this doorway while his brother guarded the other side of the mountain (see Room 59, Map O).

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** His Gargantuan halberd and Huge chainmail are not much use to the PCs. Even if they find a way to carry these items, the armor only fits Breysus. Though they are made of fine steel, neither the halberd nor the chain shirt can be cut down to a useful size, though the links of the shirt could conceivably make an excellent chain for a ship's anchor.

In his pockets are a millennium's worth of notes and scribbles written in an ancient language, totaling over 500 lbs. of appropriately sized writing materials. Some are strewn about the area, having been scattered by various creatures looking for something of value. Other notes have been taken away by the wind.

He has no gold, no gems, and nothing else of value.

The notes are written in an ancient form of celestial. If the PCs can ascertain their meaning, it will take days to get through it all. Most of it is a stream-of-consciousness note taking about Breysus' day-to-day observations. One in 50 pages talks about the nature of the prison and the honor he and his brother have been allowed to guard this entrance. Another one in 100 pages talks about the demons and devils held captive inside. Nothing specific, as he does not know the manner of their captivity, only the brushstrokes of what the prison represents. Some of the pages talk about the earthquake, but he never went inside to see the effects of it. He died before Longtail came through, so there is no mention of the creatures that now occupy Region A.

**Scaling:** N/A

#### Z2: The Tunnels

> Beyond the titan's body is a single cave mouth, too dark to see what it hides.

Should the PCs examine the cave, read further.

> The cave is low and shallow, obviously dug by small, crude hands. Many footprints mark the dirt, and debris litters every corner. In the back of the cave, a narrow tunnel, poorly lit, winds down into the earth.

If the PCs explore into the tunnel, read the following:

> The tunnel winds into the mountain, its ceiling some 6 feet high and 5 feet wide at most. After about 100 feet or so, the tunnel opens into a larger chamber, cut from stone and built rather than dug. It is obvious that something lives here.

**Encounter:** This tunnel leads to Room A1.

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### Exits

If you look carefully at the maps, you'll see that Maps D, H, L, M, and O all hint at something "beyond." While Maps H, M, and O are designed to be exits, Maps D and L have potential exits left to the GM's imagination. It would be close-minded to create a dungeon of this magnitude without leaving room for the GM to expand. In fact, another book could be published with potential exits and surrounding environs. Where would it end, exactly? Would the PCs be over level 20 when they got there?

It is up to the GM to decide whether or not the PCs can use these exits.

**East of Region D:** Some of the tunnels running east of the Map are perfect places for new adventures, a whole new campaign to begin, or a route to the surface. How far do those tunnels go? How long is the route to the surface?

**East of Region H:** While technically, the PCs can 'fly' out of the top of the Dungeon above this Region, the elves guard their steeds carefully. PCs with the ability to fly can go straight up and out of the Dungeon.

**East of Region L:** How far to the east the lake extends is up to the GM. Perhaps it's another 100 feet, or perhaps channels extend for miles underground, or to another dungeon entirely.

**North and west of Region M:** While we haven't defined the Dungeon beyond the borders of the map, the GM can either have the cavern dead end a few hundred feet up or perhaps there is a series of twisting tunnels at the higher reaches of the mountain. This could mean another adventure trying to get out.

**North of Region N:** The tomb by itself is completely walled off, but it's up to the GM how far the cavern around it extends.

**Region O:** The obvious exit is here. PCs who defeat the frost giant who has taken over are sure to find the real exit to the Dungeon. In addition, the ceiling above Regions H, K, and L is open... a few miles up. The PCs can escape from these locations if they are so inclined and able.

### X1: Magma Flow

The following location in the magma flow cuts through the center of all the maps and is described here for ease of reference. This description fits the magma flow in every Region.

> The flow of molten rock meanders to the southeast, consuming all it touches. Bubbling up from the flaming river are occasional pockets of scalding steam, shrieking and moaning, disrupting the earth's quiet. Though the flow is indeed hot, it is bearable, and when you watch the floating bit of rock flare into flame, you can see multitudes of small imp-like creatures playing in the stream, tossing balls of flaming slag at the dancing clouds playing on the fiery river's surface.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** After the earthquake shattered the Dungeon's foundation, opening a rift extending for miles, something strange happened. A small stream of liquid rock slowly filled the chasm created by the quake. It wore away the caves that underlay the Dungeon's foundation, collapsing enormous sections of the magma below and further widening the gorge. As the magma filled the bottom of the rift, it stranded many denizens on small rock islands amidst a sea of fire. Understandably, the temperature rose. Though the heat warmed the complex, it was somehow survivable. No toxic fumes wafted from the flow's surface, just steam as water from the tiny cracks and fissures poured into the burning river, creating patches of semi-solid rock on its surface. Stranger still, the creatures in the Dungeon could approach its shores without suffering from the extreme temperature. Because of its unusual properties, the complex could sustain all forms of life.

Of course, there is nothing natural about this dungeon, and the odd properties of the flow surprised no longtime inhabitants of this place. In time, it became clear why the molten rock did not fill the caves with poisonous fumes and lethal temperatures: the force of the earthquake had interacted with the Dungeon's magical properties to tear open a permanent gate in two of the Inner Planes: Earth and Fire. Liquid fire and a river of earth poured out of the gate, and when the streams crossed, the magma was created.

On the Elemental Plane of Fire, the tear attracted a lot of attention. The native magma and steam mephits investigated the gate and watched where the liquid fire blended with the flowing earth. Like moths to a flame, fire, magma, and steam mephits passed through the portal. To their horror, they discovered the gate was one-way, trapping them in the cold caverns of the massive complex. Worse, they could not warn the other mephits, who continued to spill through the gate, trapping more and more of their kind until the chasm filled.

Hordes of mephits came through the tear, but they found the frigid Dungeon inhospitable. The mephits gathered in and around the magma flow, with steam mephits lurking near the surface and magma mephits swimming through it. These outsiders absorbed the heat emitted by the molten rock. The steam mephits, thriving in such environments, contained the toxins and poisons.

Now, the mephits rarely leave the security of the magma, which allows other creatures, including the PCs, a chance for survival. The mephits have been here so long they are no longer interested in getting back to the Elemental Plane of fire and are content to spend their days mindlessly basking in the magma's heat. They do not communicate with other creatures and attack only if some fool falls in.

Fortunately, the effects of the mephits on the magma reduce the severity posed by this environmental hazard. Falling into this magma flow does not deal the normal damage. Instead, the magma deals only 21 (6d6) points of damage to unprotected characters each round, insulated as they are by the mephits who swim through it. Victims are still subject to drowning rules as described in the GMG. In addition, a swarm of magma and steam mephits attack any victim who falls into the flow. The number of mephits attacking each round varies as the flow carries them onward. Each round, 8 (1d10+3) magma mephits attack submerged PCs, or 4 (1d6+1) steam mephits and 4 (1d6+1) magma mephits attack PCs floating on the surface.

**Encounter Condition:** Extreme Heat

**Tactics:** The flow does not go in a single direction. It bounces back and forth, swirling through the Dungeon core.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, double the number of mephits that can attack the PCs. To decrease the challenge, have them arrive every other round.

### W1-W20: Empty Rooms

Though not technically a section, all 20 of these empty Rooms can be used anywhere in the Dungeon and are printed here together for convenience. While nearly every square foot of dungeon has been thoroughly mapped and detailed, every GM will find that they want just a bit more detail. These Rooms are here for that reason and may be used at the GM's discretion.

#### W1: Empty Room One

> A thick layer of dust covers the floor. Two toppled pedestals and the shattered fragments of a marble statue of an elf lie in the center of the room. As you watch, the marble head shifts slightly, and its eyelids flutter open. It stares at you with startling blue eyes for a moment, and then the eyelids close again.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This Room contains the remains of the victim of an ancient trap. The trap is no longer active, and the only thing the elf can do is shift her face slightly from stone to flesh.

**Encounter Condition:** Haunted

**Tactics:** A spell like *stone to flesh* changes her back, but her memory is so fragmented that she is of no use to the PCs. She can answer one question per PC with a 10% chance of accuracy.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W2: Empty Room Two

> An inch-thick layer of muck covers the floor of the room, and a dozen closed doors dot the exterior walls. Deeply charred runes in an unknown language mar the center of each granite door, and geometric mosaics of green, red, and yellow tiles fill the area between each door. The ceiling is covered in bronze discs, each six inches wide.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The majority of the doors are false doors. The runes and mosaics were once traps that released streams of acid from the ceiling and fired lightning bolts from the runes, but these traps were activated or failed centuries ago.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 4

**Tactics:** There is no way to get these traps working again and short of a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check, it is unlikely the PCs will ever know what the Room was used for.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W3: Empty Room Three

> The walls and ceiling of this Room are featureless, but hundreds of metallic chain links lie scattered upon the ground. Enormous anchors and segmented plates jut from the floor.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The prisoner held within this Room died centuries ago. All that is left are the chains that held him, corroded by his evil.

**Encounter Condition:** Negative Energy

**Tactics:** The chains radiate faint evil now, and the Room is too oppressive to remain in for long.

**Treasure:** N/A

#### W4: Empty Room Four

> Scores of motionless gears, cogs, chains, and various metallic bits fill this chamber, leaving barely enough room for a human to squeeze through it. Silver-inscribed etchings in each mechanism crackle with a feeble electrical charge, but the room conveys a sense of frustrated power and intricate design.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The Room once maintained several magical fields, but the mechanism failed centuries ago, and the energy dispersed. All that is left is a resonating magical aura that makes creatures nervous and edgy.

**Encounter Condition:** Fear 15

**Tactics:** PCs entering this Room are automatically Frightened; should they fail to move towards an exit at the earliest opportunity, they must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W5: Empty Room Five

> Thick cobwebs obscure vision beyond a few inches, but a harsh buzz echoes from the interior of the room. Tiny spiders scatter before your light and disappear into the webs' depths. The stench of rotting meat wafts through the cloistered air of the chamber.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The only thing within the Room is the rotting corpse of a demon killed centuries ago. Its body constantly regenerates damage at the same rate that it decays, maintaining a perverse stasis. The body is home to thousands of flies, beetles, and other vermin.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises, Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** While too few insects nest in the corpse to create a swarm, the GM is free to have a few rats and insects cohabitate as something pest-like anyway. A vermin swarm made of bugs and rats could be a unique encounter here.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W6: Empty Room Six

> The stench of death pervades this chamber. The air is thick, and a fine layer of dust covers the stone floor. A painting depicting a large woman in an elaborate pink robe hangs in the center of the north wall. Beneath it is a large wooden coffin. Its lid has been smashed open, and its wood has rotted. A closer look reveals the skeletal remains of a humanoid inside, interred with his clothes and sword.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The remains are those of an orc male who died ages ago. While it is not obvious what he died from, he was buried with his belongings, suggesting he was important. But why bury him here?

**Encounter Condition:** Desecration 2

**Tactics:** Depending on the orc culture of the GM's game world, the orc could have been buried alive, burned and then buried, had his brain stored in a jar nearby, or any of a hundred other burial rituals. The details are left wide open.

**Treasure:** The painting portrays an unknown woman. Though not of particularly high quality, it is ancient and thus worth over 100 gp to the right person. The clothing is rotted and useless, but the sword is of good quality. It requires a good cleaning and sharpening. It is possible the orc was buried with a few other items, including (and up to) one common magic item (not a potion) or trinket.

> **Nomenclature**
>
> We used a few keywords to make reading this a little easier.
>
> **Map.** There are 16 maps in this dungeon. They can be cut into smaller lairs for individual adventures or brought together into one campaign.
>
> **Random Encounter.** Every Section of the Dungeon has its own Random Encounter chart. These are usually rolled every hour, but they can be altered to taste.
>
> **Region.** An entire Map and its contents are called a Region. There are 15 Regions in the Dungeon, with Region N being twice the size of the others. Each Region has its own chapter in this book. While Region and Map are nearly synonymous, they are not interchangeable terms.
>
> **Room.** The place where the PCs are standing. It can be a 10 ft. by 10 ft. cube. Or it can be a 100 foot wide cavern. So long as there is an encounter there, it's a Room. Every Room is numbered. If it's not numbered, it's not a Room.
>
> **Section.** The territory that the monsters/creatures/NPCs occupy. "Rooms K1 through K24," for instance, is a Section of the Dungeon. Some rules affect an entire Section, or certain Random Encounters may occur only in that Section. A Section comprises many Rooms and should not be confused with a Region.

#### W7: Empty Room Seven

> This room is devoid of decoration, but its doors are framed by heavy stone structures sculpted with runes in intriguing patterns. These intricate frames are beautifully crafted but otherwise ordinary in design. The runes are decorative and not in any immediately known language.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** An angel sculptor fashioned the beautiful doorframes of this Room, which housed archon builders when the vast dungeon complex was created.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Consider making the runes an ancient form of a language one of the PCs speaks. It is hard to translate word for word, but the suggestion is that the angel sculptor left behind a love, but not a paramour. Not everything in the dungeon needs to be bleak.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W8: Empty Room Eight

> A large stone desk dominates this otherwise empty room. An elaborate candelabrum of tarnished silver sits on the grey desk. Its three candles dimly illuminate bas-reliefs on the walls, representing the grotesque faces of demons, gargoyles, and other terrifying creatures. The carvings are so well done that they appear real under the half-light of the room.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The bas-reliefs in this Room were fashioned by the celestial builders of the Dungeon, adding to the otherwise dismal surroundings. They represent some of the most fearsome creatures originally imprisoned within the vast complex, as seen by an angelic artist.

**Encounter Condition:** Positive Energy, Safe

**Tactics:** The place is safe to rest in for about 4 hours before the PCs find the irresistible urge to move on. Angels are not lazy (idle hands and all that) and only made this Room for short respites.

**Treasure:** The candelabrum has three stems and is worth a mere 5 sp if cleaned. The candles are enchanted with *light*, however, and can be used as though they were three scrolls of *light* (one for each candle) by any character, regardless of spellcasting ability. They remain lit permanently while in this room.

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W9: Empty Room Nine

> The blackened remains of a great tapestry hang in the doorway. Beyond the ruined tapestry is a dais bearing a large throne. Both the dais and throne are made from dark gray stone - the same material as the walls of this foreboding place. The walls are darkened by soot, and the faint smell of burnt wood lingers in the air.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This Room once served as a meeting hall for the angel wardens. Under the leadership of their commanders, the angels discussed ways of improving the security of the Dungeon. Demons destroyed the place centuries ago.

**Encounter Condition:** Unhallowed

**Tactics:** There is an uneasiness to the Room now. Once a holy place, the foul taint of demons can be felt by just standing there.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W10: Empty Room Ten

> Though the walls of this shockingly clean empty room are not exactly mirrored, they glimmer with dim reflections. The floor seems as spotless as the walls and doesn't appear to have accumulated any dust at all.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** There is a very large, round, invisible table in the center of the Room, bolted to the floor. In fact, physical inspection of the walls or floor proves the Room isn't quite as clean and spotless as it appears. Any creature or object that remains in this Room for more than an hour turns invisible. The effect is continuous and cannot be dispelled so long as the creature or object remains inside the Room.

**Encounter Condition:** Invisibility

**Tactics:** PCs walking cavalierly through the Room are liable to bang into the table. A Small creature will hit its head and chest, while a Medium creature strikes its thighs and waist into the table. This is annoying, but the table doesn't damage the PCs.

As soon as the PCs leave the Room, the effect ends, and they can be seen again. PCs of low Wisdom believe they remain invisible for 1d4 minutes per point of Wisdom below 10. In essence, the Invisibility is a trick on the mind of the person being affected, not the person viewing them.

**Treasure:** The table cannot fit through the doors, even if it is unbolted from the floor. It is made of sturdy hardwood and is not magical. Nothing else lies in this Room except for invisible dust and dirt.

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W11: Empty Room Eleven

> The pale brown walls, ceiling, and floor are covered with some sort of leathery canvas, though no means of attachment can be seen. The air is stagnant, and the odor of sweat is heavy in this room. A small, dark, irregular circle seems to be painted on the floor.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** At one time, this Room was trapped with an incredibly complex and powerful spell, a last line of defense against a particularly nasty inhabitant of this Region. The only remnant of the trap is the Room itself, made up of the body of the creature that triggered the trap.

The dark paint on the floor is actually a blood stain where the floor was once cut.

**Encounter Condition:** Fear 12

**Tactics:** Once the PCs realize the walls were made from the flesh of a living creature, a fear effect is produced. Failing a DC 12 Constitution saving throw causes them to become nauseated for 3 (1d6) minutes. Nauseated creatures have disadvantage on physical ability checks and all attack rolls.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W12: Empty Room Twelve

> Opposite the massive stone door of this hall is a 10 foot statue of black stone. The effigy represents a humanoid male, thick arms crossed across its massive chest. Though out of place, the statue is surprisingly clean and in good condition. Its pupilless eyes seem to stare eerily at you.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Angel wardens, now dead, sculpted this statue of a great celestial. It has remained untouched to this day.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 5

**Tactics:** Due to its powerful magical aura, monsters avoid this Room. As such, Random Encounters occur half as often here.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W13: Empty Room Thirteen

> A small grove of trees surrounds the stone floor of this Room, standing amidst snow-covered benches and a stone bowl full of ice. The normal floor gives way to a beautiful wintry landscape. As you look up to see the top of a giant fir tree in the corner, the stone ceiling blocks your view.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The scenic winter wonderland is real, created by an artist of unsurpassed talent, with several sets of *marvelous pigments*. The trees, though not alive, are real. The snow and ice are real. Anyone can walk among the trees and kick up some snow. There are no magical illusions in this Room, but the walls are painted in such a way as to trick the viewer's eye. Visually, the Room appears to extend for miles when, in actuality, it fills an area 10 feet larger to a side than the Room's original space.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe

**Tactics:** If the PCs stand in the center of the Room, the optical illusion is perfect. If the GM feels so inclined, creatures from the Region could be resting here, but none are inclined to conflict because the Room radiates a constant *Calm Emotions* effect that can only be overcome with a DC 22 Charisma saving throw.

**Treasure:** Though PCs may find this Room a treasure beyond words, there is nothing of physical value here.

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W14: Empty Room Fourteen

*This empty Room is best used if the PCs need to get across to another door. Otherwise, it will just frustrate them.*

> A dense fog fills this room, obscuring sight and muffling sounds. Footsteps can be heard walking away from the door through the fog, but beyond that, you find yourself completely isolated from the world around you.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** All sound in this Room is magically dampened past 10 feet. This means that PCs venturing more than 10 feet away from each other lose contact completely until they stumble upon each other again in the fog. The footsteps start and stop every few seconds and eventually lead PCs to a door out of the Room (possibly the one they came through). Players that request to do so may have their PCs attempt a DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) or Spellcasting ability check to realize the sound of the footsteps is illusory.

**Encounter Condition:** Fog 5, Haunted

**Tactics:** Feel free to have the footsteps move in random directions. This effect works best in a large Room with at least two doors.

Do not use miniatures or maps for this encounter.

**Treasure:** Feel free to drop a common magic item (or two potions) somewhere in the Room. On each PCs turn roll 1d20: on a roll of 19 or higher they are within 10 feet and a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check will find it.

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W15: Empty Room Fifteen

> The interior of this room reeks of rotting flesh, and flies buzz loudly. In the center of the room, a pile of charred wood is surrounded by six humanoid corpses. Another corpse lies on its side, partially leaning against the wall opposite the door. All of the bodies are in similar states of decay and have been stripped.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The corpses are of six goblins that got lost in the Dungeon and finally settled down here to rest before taking up their wandering again. Unfortunately for the goblins, the guard on watch fell asleep, and the whole group was murdered in their sleep.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** It is not clear who killed them and if the killers were the ones to loot the bodies.

**Treasure:** If the PCs search the bodies, a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check turns up a gold necklace worth 100 gp around the ankle of one of the goblins.

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W16: Empty Room Sixteen

*The door to this Room is locked, requiring a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to unlock. In addition, the lock is trapped. Choose a trap from Appendix A.*

> At the center of this room, a badly decomposed winged body lies. Its arms, legs, and wings cast out to the four winds; the body has obviously been the target of violence since its death. Shreds of fine raiment cover the body, but all weapons, armor, and goods have been removed. Next to the body, writing has been scratched in the stone.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This was one of the members of the celestial garrison who was slain after the first earthquake. Before he died, he carved his last words on the stone floor. In Celestial, they read, "Alsar of the Bright Host. I stood fast against the darkness and now travel into the light. Let you who find my body carry on the fight in my stead." Alsar was slain, and his corpse was desecrated by creatures of the Dungeon.

**Encounter Condition:** Positive Energy

**Tactics:** Perhaps the Room's contents have been shrouded by illusion, or the PCs were destined to find it, but this discovery points out that the Dungeon was once something much different than they thought. If this is their first encounter with the celestials or this information has never been imparted to the PC, they now have some record of the Dungeon's past.

**Treasure:** Touching the body of the celestial turns it to dust but grants that PC +1 Con and +1 Wis until their next Long Rest. In addition, the PC is granted a vision of some important event in the history of the Dungeon. Make it vague but provide a hint that the Dungeon was more than it is now (as the spell *divination*). The celestial also bore a signet ring on his left hand. This signet could prove useful in Region C, E, or G, where identification as a "celestial-aligned" being is useful.

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W17: Empty Room Seventeen

> The floor of this room is missing. Instead, there is a pit of significant depth, at the bottom of which is nothing but spikes and corpses. The walls and ceiling are bare except for a few scratch marks. A foul odor indicates that the bodies have been rotting for some time.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This Room contains a pit trap that is now stuck in the open position, nothing more than a very deep pit with spikes at the bottom. Some of the local residents use the pit for garbage disposal, particularly for the bodies of their enemies. With a DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, the trap can be repaired and the floor restored to the Room.

**Hidden Pit.** Mechanical trap. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns the uncanny appearance of the section of ground that forms the pit's cover while a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit. When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper. Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit's cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the *arcane lock* spell or similar magic.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** Because residents frequently bring trash here, roll for a Random Encounter after 30 minutes.

**Treasure:** If the PCs climb down into the pit and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, they find 13 sp, a rusted shortsword, and 2 (1d3) mundane trinkets of the GM's choice. If they succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom (Perception) check, they additionally find a large yellow diamond worth 500 gp.

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W18: Empty Room Eighteen

*Before the PCs open the door, read the following:*

> This door is abnormally warm. Heat emanates from the room beyond, and you can hear the sound of fire and an odd "whooshing" noise after short but irregular intervals.

*Once the PCs open the door, read the following:*

> This entire Room is scorched black. After a few seconds, the Room is entirely engulfed in flame, creating a 'whoosh' noise as air rushes in to feed the fire. This process repeats frequently, rarely taking longer than half a minute between bursts.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This Room contains a fireball trap, but the trigger has malfunctioned, and now the fireball goes off at random intervals (every 5 (2d4) rounds), destroying anything placed inside. The vent for the fireball trap is set in the ceiling, and the lever to turn it off is on the far wall. If the PCs wish to cross the Room, they must find a way to disable the trap without getting cooked.

The PC disabling the trap must brave the fire to reach the lever. Once they reach the lever, they must move as quickly as possible to disarm the trap. While a DC 16 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables the trap, this takes 5 (1d6+2) rounds. Every two points by which the PC's roll exceeds 16 reduces the time needed to disable the trap by 1 round.

**Fake Fireball Trap.** Magic trap. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as *detect magic*, reveals an aura of Illusion magic around the Room. PCs hit by the flames take no damage but must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened for one round.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The fire is an illusion. A powerful illusion, but an illusion. The PCs should believe on every level that it is real until proven otherwise.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, make the fireball trap real. To decrease the challenge, add some element to the Room that makes the trap appear more "fake."

**Real Fireball Trap.** Magic trap. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as *detect magic*, reveals an aura of Evocation magic around the Room. PCs hit by the flames must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### W19: Empty Room Nineteen

*The door to this Room has broken off its hinges.*

> The door to this room has long ago been splintered, and only a few scraps of wood hang from the hinges. The walls are dominated by large wooden bookcases lined with scraps of paper, broken bindings, and other remnants of an impressive library. The bookcases have not fared much better. The entire room is ready to collapse.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Once one of the libraries used by the celestial garrison, this Room has been exposed to the damp air and several species of insects for the last few centuries. Now, its contents are all but destroyed. Any human contact destroys the surviving books in this Room, but there are few of those to be found. Most of the books in this Room have long ago rotted away.

**Encounter Condition:** Fog 15

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** If the PCs succeed at a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check or a DC 18 Intelligence (Religion) check, they find a divine spell scroll (*glyph of warding*) that has survived the ages.

**Scaling:** N/A

#### W20: Empty Room Twenty

> While no heat radiates off the walls of this Room, the walls are constantly bathed in fire. A ring of red and blue flame coats the walls and floors, turning the stone black.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The wall of fire is an illusion. It produces no heat and cannot harm the PCs. However, if they believe it is real, it deals 18 (2d6+11) fire damage, just like a real wall of fire. If the PCs see past the illusion (DC 18 Wisdom saving throw), they see the walls are clean, and the fire hasn't touched anything.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Visions

**Tactics:** If the PCs move around the Room, there is a 10% chance each round that they step on a pressure plate which turns the effect off. It is unclear what the designers of the Dungeon intended with this Room.

7 (2d6) rounds after the fire goes off, the walls are showered with sheets of ice and cold. This effect is also an illusion, but PCs believing the Room was ringed with fire now believe it is ringed with ice.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the door close when the PCs enter and make the inside of the door look like stone, so finding a way out is more difficult. To decrease the challenge, reduce the damage of the illusory fire to 7 (2d6).

## Map V: The Vampire Tomb

The only location that exists under the Dungeon is a vampire tomb in Region J. The map and location descriptions for this section are in the Region J chapter.

> **Spellbooks**
>
> Wizards do not have it easy in this dungeon. No, that's not strong enough. Wizards get hosed by this Dungeon. Because the PCs are going to be underground for about two game years, with no way of returning to the surface, it's difficult for wizards to justify spells appearing in their spellbooks without reason.
>
> Sorcerers, druids, and clerics all draw their power from a less tangible source, but a wizard has no new sources of magic. Because this may upset those wanting to play spellcasters, there are a number of ways to help wizards through this.
>
> There are plenty of scrolls scattered throughout every Region (and plenty of room for the GM to drop them into the Dungeon as you see fit). When these scrolls are discovered, the wizard can merely place the spells in his spell book rather than use them in combat. This ensures that wizards always have something but wholly determines what they can and cannot learn.
>
> Alternatively, the GM can allow wizards to start with a full spellbook (as a 20th-level wizard), forcing the fledgling wizard to choose all his spells ahead of time. This is challenging, but can also put a wizard who is unprepared for specific challenges at a huge disadvantage. GMs should choose half of the spells for a spell book of this nature.
>
> If a wizard gains access to a divine (or bardic) spell that also appears on the arcane spell list, the GM may allow the wizard to learn that spell. If the wizard studies the spell from a divine spell caster, add +5 to the DC check to learn it. Increase the modifier by +2 per spell level difference between the lists. If the wizard wants to learn a spell that's 3rd level for a cleric but 2nd level for a wizard, increase the DC by +7. No matter what, the wizard can learn only those spells that appear on his spell list.
>
> Finally, the GM can simply allow the PC to choose whichever spells he likes as he goes up in level. This is the least exciting method, but gives PCs the greatest spread of options.
>
> Ultimately, whatever the GM decides is law.
>
> One last thing: there are certain spells (*grease*, *entangle*, *web*, etc.) that are one-note and a little powerful for an all-dungeon campaign. They will get repetitive and exploitative. It is our recommendation that GMs do not include them. GMs should do the same with the PCs.
