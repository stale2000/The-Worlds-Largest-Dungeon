# Region B (continued)

## B49-B68. THE BUGBEAR ENCAMPMENTS

For centuries, the bugbears dominated the other goblinoids in the Region. Neither the goblins nor the hobgoblins could match the ferocious attacks and cunning tactics of the bugbears. Where once their domain was extensive, the alliance of the goblins and remaining hobgoblins, coupled with the zealous new outlook the goblins wield, has driven the bugbears back to these few rooms in the western section of the Region.

During their reign of dominance, the bugbears spent a fair amount of time dismantling many of the celestials' traps. They took advantage of the damage the earthquake did to the Region. A few of the more complex traps were left standing, as the bugbears could simply not fathom how to disable them. The destroyed traps have been replaced by simpler ones of the bugbears' design, which they can reset and modify as they see fit.

The intimate knowledge and ever-changing array of traps have kept the bugbears safe in this domain, their final refuge. The tactics and numbers of their enemies may thwart them in the rest of the Region, but here on their home turf, they control the field and eagerly look forward to the day the goblin empire topples and they can reclaim their former greatness.

It is possible, however unlikely, for the PCs to gain the trust of the bugbears and ally themselves with them against the goblins and hobgoblins. This is quite difficult to accomplish as the bugbears view the PCs as yet another faction vying for power in the Region. If the PCs can gain the trust of the bugbears, they gain allies who know the Region very well and have the power to make the PCs' trek through the Region much easier. The simplest way to gain the bugbear's trust is to show them the bodies of slain goblins. Deeds, not words, have the best chance of swaying the bugbears here.

There are surprisingly few bugbears in these encampments. Many are off on sorties against the goblin empire. The few that remain plan new raids and repair the traps they have laid for the goblins.

If the bugbears believe the PCs are allied with the goblins, however, they will not give the PCs any chance to prove otherwise.

### Random Encounters

Roll for a random encounter once per hour. No random encounters occur in (or around) the secret chambers of rooms B49 through B51.

| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | This section of the dungeon is unnerving. It could be the air, or the shadows, or the way the sound plays off the walls, but something about this area is disturbing. **[Haunted]**. |
| 2 | The sound of heavy footfalls echoes throughout the dungeon. A group of bugbears are out hunting goblins, or anything else invading their space. The PCs must succeed at three DC 14 Stealth checks. These are not normal Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and are not contested rolls. If the PCs choose to spend extra time by not moving from where they are, they should have advantage on these checks, and should not suffer armor disadvantage. If they fail any of the checks, they encounter the bugbears, as if a 19 had been rolled on this table. |
| 3-12 | Nothing. |
| 13 | A stone block falls from the ceiling, striking a random PC for 4d6 bludgeoning damage unless they pass a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Allow one PC a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 17) to spot the brick before it has a chance to harm anyone. |
| 14 | A pack of 1d4+2 **worgs** wander the dungeon. They are not hunting the PCs, and have only a 25% chance of noticing them. If the PCs do not wish to confront the worgs, they must succeed at a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid being noticed. If the PCs elect to stop for a time, grant them advantage on those checks, and remove armor disadvantage for them. |
| 15 | A pair of bugbears are resetting a scything blade trap (see room B1). The PCs notice the bugbears first if any roll higher than a 15 on a Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the bugbears get the drop on them. Whichever side loses this is surprised. |
| 16 | See 13, but instead of falling of their own accord the stone pieces are attached to a tripwire. Depending on the party's formation more than one party member can be hit. The blocks now strike 1d4 party members and deal 6d6 of damage on a failed saving throw. |
| 17 | A group of three **ethereal marauders** turn the corner and face the PCs. They are startled by the PCs' presence. They have a 50% chance of fleeing outright. Otherwise, they are Unfriendly to the PCs unless attacked. |
| 18 | The PCs chance upon a violent skirmish between the bugbears and goblins down the hall. 3d6 goblins are engaged in furious combat with 2d4+1 bugbears. One of the goblins spots the PCs and both groups strike out and turn their attention to the PCs. |
| 19 | The noises of the PCs have attracted the attention of a nearby bugbear patrol. Impose a -2 penalty on the PCs' Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the bugbears before they attack. The party is made up of 2d4+1 bugbears armed with short spears and swords. Aughkin (Room B62) leads the patrol. |
| 20 | Bartleby (Room B29) is inspecting a portion of the wall here. He seems intent on his work and doesn't look up as the PCs arrive. Bartleby suffers a -4 penalty to his Wisdom (Perception) checks for 30 seconds. |

## B49. SANCTUM

The door to this room was locked, requiring a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (DC 19) to pick open.

This hidden room is in good repair. A simple desk and chair, and a large oak bookcase are the only furnishings. The desk is empty, but a number of small bottles are scattered over the shelves of the bookcase.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The bugbears never discovered the secret door in Room B51. They don't know this place exists, leaving it free from their stench. Surprisingly, there are no traps or enchantments here, and Wisdom (Perception) checks of 15+ give an overwhelming confidence that the room is free of danger.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe

**Tactics:** Used as a sanctum years ago, the room is a perfect hiding place for the PCs. The time it takes to complete short or long rests here is halved, owing to the surprising comfort... or perhaps some celestial enchantments.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## B50. SECRET CHAMBER

As the PCs near the secret door on the eastern wall of Room B59, read the following:

> A sliver of light spills out into the hallway from a crack in the wall.

As the PCs near the secret door on the western wall of Room B50, read the following:

> A sliver of yellow light spills out into the hallway from a crack in the wall. Grunting sounds can be heard from behind it.

Finding the secret door requires a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check and a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to slide it open. A small, rough stone doubles as a handle, allowing the PCs to simply lift the door open. The secret door on the western wall is jammed and requires a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check in addition to the Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

As the PCs enter the room, read the following:

> An oddly shaped room opens. In the middle of the room, set into the northern wall, is a stone door. The room contains no furnishings other than a stack of four strongboxes, one on top of the other. Wherever the sound was coming from is gone for now.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is more of a causeway, used by the celestials to shuffle about behind the scenes. There is nothing here to explore (except the strongboxes), but opening the doors could prove a challenge to the PCs.

This room contains three hidden doors. Whichever one the PCs came through stays open for 2d6 seconds before closing. After that, they can easily find and open the door again.

The door on the northeastern wall leads to Room B49 and requires a DC 25 Investigation check to find and a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open. The same is true of opening it from the other side. This secret door remains open for 2d6 seconds.

The secret door on the southeastern wall leads to a long corridor and the secret door on the western wall opens into a north-south corridor (that leads to either Room B52 or B53). Finding either secret door requires a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check and a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to slide it open. A small, rough stone doubles as a handle, allowing the PCs to merely lift the door open.

The secret door on the western wall can easily be found from the inside but requires a DC 14 Athletics check to open in addition to the Sleight of Hand check.

The door to the north is locked (from both sides) and requires a DC 22 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open. The small interior chamber leads to another, similar locked door that is also locked on both sides.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 6, Safe

**Tactics:** The sounds the PCs heard were the dungeon playing tricks on their ears. There is no one here, but when the doors are closed and the PCs stand just outside it seems like there is.

**Treasure:** All four boxes are equally weighted and none make any sound when shaken. The third strongbox, however, is the only one with anything in it. All four are locked.

Each strongbox requires a DC 27 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open and each lock is trapped with a poison needle trap. If anything except a key is inserted, the needle springs forth, jabbing the intruder. Victims that fail a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw take 2d8 poison damage and must succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. They are easy to spot and should only get the most careless of thieves. The mechanism will not reset automatically once fired.

In the third box, strapped to the inside of the lid, are five potions: **healing** (×2), **resistance**, **sanctuary**, and **gaseous form**.

**Scaling:** N/A

## B51. PRIVATE STUDY

The door leading to this room is locked, requiring a DC 27 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to pick.

> This is a simply furnished room, with a small cot and a table. A tattered pillow and blanket rest on the cot, and both reek of mold and mildew. Upon the table is a shiny, gold ring and a hefty book.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Before the doppelganger Argliss took over the goblin empire, he made this room his home. Well hidden, it proved a solid base of operations to fall back to. While he spent years living here, he never returned after becoming king. Knowing his journal was safe, he left the room as it was, hoping one day to trap something with his ruse.

The ring on the table is rigged to explode, consuming the book in a blaze and harming those who trespass. It is rigged with a **fire trap** (Room B18).

**Encounter Condition:** Safe

**Tactics:** If the PCs disable the trap on the ring (a hefty task), the ring and the book are theirs. The book is Argliss' journal. It details his encounters with the halfling Bartleby (room B28). The doppelganger is quite upset with the loss of the artifact Bartleby seeks. Bartleby is allowed to keep any other artifacts he finds in the Region as payment, provided the artifact is returned to Argliss.

While it does not say anywhere in the journal that Argliss is a doppelganger, it does allude to strange circumstances where he is not always a goblin. Allow the PCs a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check or a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check to deduce he is a barghest. If they succeed at a DC 21 History check or a DC 25 Intelligence (Nature) check, they realize he is not a barghest, but a doppelganger. The GM should make these checks secretly so the PCs don't know whose information to trust.

**Treasure:** The last page of the journal is a **scroll of fireball**. The ring radiates strong transmutation magic and appears to be a **ring of invisibility** if the PCs cast *identify* on it. It is actually a **cursed ring** with several side effects. First, it causes the wearer to automatically fail saving throws against the *scry* spell. In addition, the wearer can never turn invisible, no matter the strength of the spell. It also causes the wearer to be constantly under the effect of a *zone of truth*. Lastly, while the wearer's alignment does not change, they cannot willingly violate any lawful good tenets, including killing innocents, betraying a trust, or deceiving a fellow man. While they don't have to always behave "lawful good", they do have to monitor more obvious actions. This powerful magic item was here when Argliss moved in and he never put it on, for fear of the celestial's games.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the Investigation DC of the fire trap by +5. To decrease the challenge, reduce the Intelligence (Arcana) DC of the fire trap by -5.

---

## B52. STRAY DIRE WOLF

> You hear a low, deep growl as you approach an open chamber ahead. A wandering dire wolf stalks the hallways, its hackles raised. It snarls at you, baring its fangs menacingly from the darkness ahead.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** A lone **dire wolf** roams the hallways, apparently lost. It has been here for some time and grows more agitated as the hours roll on. When the PCs enter the room, the wolf attacks.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), Fearless

**Tactics:** This dire wolf is fast and agile. Having roamed these halls for some time, it is worked up. The dire wolf gains the effects of the **Mobility** and **Alert** feats. In combat, it attacks the closest PC and continues attacking until it is subdued or the PCs are dead. It trips PCs on each attack, moving onto the next PC, once one is down. If two PCs are down at the same time, it takes a round to bite a prone PC before moving on. Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks involving the beast are performed at disadvantage.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one dire wolf. To decrease the challenge, remove the benefit of the Alert and Mobility feats.

---

## B53. THE RESERVOIR

> Towards the back of this large room is a low, circular well. The well's placement is reminiscent of a town square fountain. The principle difference is that the well has no discernable bottom. In front of the well is a small sack with gems spilling out of it.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Whatever the original purpose of the room was has been lost. Now, the bugbears use this room to dispose of captured goblins and other creatures, having placed the gems here to lure goblin patrols. Lifting the sack triggers the pressure-sensitive plate (which can be noticed by rolling higher than a 15 on a Wisdom (Perception) check) underneath. When triggered, the door to the room seals and it rapidly floods to a depth of about 4 ft. This is ultimately harmless, but after 3 minutes the room begins to drain.

PCs must succeed two consecutive DC 14 Strength (Athletics) checks or be sucked down the 50 ft. drop into the well. The trip is rough and deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage as they strike the walls on the way down. Climbing out is difficult but not impossible, requiring a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check to perform well, otherwise they incur a level of exhaustion. Enterprising PCs might trigger the trap again to force a stuck PC out.

The door to the room has a stubborn seal that can be defeated with a wedge of some variety and a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics), or a DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Unsealing the flooded room drains its contents into the nearby area and breaks its mechanism for good.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, change the room's drain timer from 3 minutes to 6d20 seconds. This is rolled each time the room is triggered. To decrease the challenge, reduce the DC of the Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks by -5.

---

## B54. THE BUGBEAR PACK LEADERS' HALL

> This massive room is furnished with hides and skulls, trophies of a more prosperous time for the bugbears. The walls are rough, and covered in crude runes and hairline cracks. The floor is stained badly, and littered with scraps of bone. In the middle of the room is a squat, wide table with a large map placed on it. Around the room are four bugbears. The largest snarls at you and reaches for his club.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** Unless the PCs have spoken with Aughkin (Room B62) the three bugbears in this room attack the PCs without hesitation. If the PCs have spoken with Aughkin, the bugbears' initial attitude is Unfriendly instead and they do not attack the PCs.

While the bugbears' attitude is Unfriendly, the PCs can negotiate with them, deferring to their leader, **Sharpfang**. Sharpfang is particularly ornery and pays the barest amount of lip service to Aughkin's "presumed" status within the encampment. He humors the PCs to increase his own stature and gain respect from his fellow bugbears.

His knowledge is limited to the goblin and bugbear war. Sharpfang does not give the PCs any insights about traps or what to expect in the dungeons. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Insight) check reveals that Sharpfang does not care if the PCs fall victim to the traps in the dungeon or not. He could give the PCs valuable information, but he chooses not to.

Sharpfang and his raiding party created the map on the table. It details the bugbear encampment and the goblin empire (Rooms B52 to B91). While it's marked with dots and splotches, the placement is incomprehensible to the PCs. Only Sharpfang is sure what the markings mean, and he refuses to tell them. If the PCs call him on this refusal to help, he gets angry. If they continue to push, he attacks.

**Encounter Condition:** Fearless

**Tactics:** Sharpfang attacks the strongest PC, while his subordinates watch his flank, striking any PCs who get near him.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one bugbear. To decrease the challenge, remove two.

---

## B55. A BLACK PEARL?

The secret door leading to this has not been found in centuries. The PCs must succeed at a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find this secret door. It is completely flush with the stone and even if they know it's there, they only gain advantage to locate the groove in the wall. If successful they pry open a 4 ft. wide door that allows access to the room.

> This room is cramped due to a large pedestal that takes up the center of the room. The top of the pedestal is covered in black velvet. Nestled in the center of the velvet is a single, flat black stone. Oddly, there is no dust in the room.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** If the PCs aren't paranoid about the traps in this Region, they haven't tried hard enough. Chances are they believe the stone is trapped, seeing it resting on a pedestal, unguarded. In fact, it is not. The PCs merely need to walk up and lift the stone from the pedestal. But they don't have to know that.

**Encounter Condition:** [Drafty]

**Tactics:** If the door to this room is left ajar, it creates a draft that sweeps through, threatening to blow out torches.

**Treasure:** The pearl on the pedestal is actually a **bead of force**. It lacks the ability to trap creatures inside its radius, instead dealing an extra 8d8 radiant damage on impact.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## B56. THE BUGBEARS' WORKSHOP

> A large workbench stretches along the northern wall. Tools lie haphazardly on top of and underneath it. Shelves lying against the western wall contain scraps of iron, brass, and copper. Off in a corner of the room are piles of leather and rope.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Whether it is a new spear or a piece of a deadly trap, if the bugbears need it they make it in this room. The tools are handmade and crude, but they serve their purpose. The bugbears are not master craftsmen by any means, but they do good work and their cunning in devising traps has served them well. At the moment, the room is empty, but the bugbears in Room B57 are busy at work.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 2

**Tactics:** If the PCs succeed at DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) checks, they hear grunts coming from the other side of the wall. While the secret door here is not obvious, there is enough of a gap for sound to come through.

The secret door leads to Room B57 and requires a DC 21 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find. It does not appear on the map in Room B25 and therefore the PCs do not get a bonus to find it. If the PCs make a great deal of noise, allow the bugbears in Room B57 Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice them.

**Treasure:** The workshop contains scraps of iron, brass, and copper as well as multiple shafts of wood. There is also a small pile of leather and rope. The tools themselves are worthless, simple things made for large hands.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## B57. THE BUGBEARS' ARMORY

> This room serves as the armory. Aside from the various weapons that adorn the racks and shelves in this room, you can't help but notice a group of surly goblinoids, seven feet tall, and covered in fur. They are sorting through scrounged debris and piles of stones, as they look up to see you.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Unlike the majority of rooms in their domain, the armory of the bugbears is not abandoned. Three bugbears have just returned from a patrol and are sorting through some of the supplies they've scrounged (rope, wood, etc.). They do not take kindly to intrusions, especially in one of their hidden caches. If they do not hear or see the PCs coming, they are surprised, but ready for battle nonetheless.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The bugbears attack the closest PCs, and stay in a tight group. They use their size to their advantage and do everything they can to push the fight into the hall. Weak PCs are easy targets and the bugbears hurl whatever they can find at pesky spellcasters who launch spells from the back of the party.

**Treasure:** The armory contains a dozen short spears, three long spears, six short swords, eight greatclubs, and an assortment of rope, stones, wire, wood, and anything else they could manage to scrounge.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two bugbears. To decrease the challenge, remove one.

---

## B58. SUPPLY ROOM

> Empty barrels and empty shelves fill this room; a supply depot, in serious need of supplies by all appearances. Only scraps of iron and leather, and a few sticks, are currently in stock.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The bugbears store spare parts for their traps, as well as additional supplies for making weapons here. The current lack of supplies indicates how bad off the bugbears currently are in their campaign against the goblins.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The supply room contains scraps of iron and leather, as well as a few bundles of short sticks that could possibly be used for spears.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## B59. SLEEPING QUARTERS

> Various animal hides and blankets cover the floor. You get the impression this is a communal sleeping room for the remaining bugbears. The room feels safe and secure, and you can understand why the bugbears chose it. Fortunately for you, it is deserted at present.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The bugbears, when not out raiding, retreat here to rest. They have claimed a great number of safe rooms in their small domain, and use them to their advantage. Other than the animal hides covering the floor, this room is empty.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The animal hides on the floor could possibly be used for barter, or the PC's own personal use. Aside from those, the room holds no treasure.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## B60. ENTRANCEWAY TO THE INNER SANCTUM

The secret door can be found by the PCs with a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. While the door is secret, it is also locked. Opening the secret door requires a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to manipulate the hidden mechanism. Alternatively, the PCs can use Aughkin's (Room B62) key, which requires them to encounter him as a Random Encounter.

> Fine, almost powdery, rubble litters the floor of this room. Along the west wall are three separate doors. Based on the contents, it's safe to assume this is a storeroom for the inhabitants of the dungeon.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The bugbears have utilized the resources left behind by the celestials well. They survive the vicious goblin attacks mainly because their guerrilla tactics and cunning make them hard to find. The lock on the secret door makes it more difficult still even for knowing goblins to enter. The bugbears' private quarters are located off of this room. Even with the protection of a secret entrance, the bugbears take no chances. The rubble strewn about the floor of this room should tip off the PCs to another bugbear trap. Among the rubble is strung a web of tripwires. Triggering one drops a stone block from the ceiling, striking the offending PC for 4d6 bludgeoning damage unless they pass a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A successful Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 17) to spot the tripwires.

**Encounter Condition:** Hazardous Footing 14

**Tactics:** If the PCs make too much noise here, roll for a Random Encounter.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the damage of stone blocks from the ceiling trap to 5d8. To decrease the challenge, lower the damage to 4d3.

---

## B61. THE HEALER

> This room seems out of place. While other rooms in this stretch of the dungeon are either wide, empty halls or small, cramped cells, this room is... cozy. A large goblinoid sits placidly in the center of the room, adding to the overall strangeness of the scene. His hair is white, perhaps from age, and his manner is calm and unobtrusive.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** This bugbear, known only as **Healer**, is quiet, serene, and imposing. Standing a full 7 ft. high, Healer is white-haired and appears very wise. The Healer is not typical of the bugbears by any means. He has lived long enough to understand that war between the goblinoid tribes is unnecessary, but an irrefutable fact of their heritage. He has resigned himself to seclusion.

He couldn't care less about the PCs' presence, but helps them out—giving them medicinal herbs to heal their wounds—if asked. The Healer does not "waste" magical healing on the PCs unless the PCs have proven themselves to be stoic allies of the bugbears first. He reserves his magic for his comrades, unsure of when the goblins could attack next.

The PCs can ask Healer about the bugbears; he answers their questions to the best of his abilities. He is tired of the war and simply wishes to be left undisturbed in his sanctuary. If the PCs are in the room for more than one hour, the Healer starts to get agitated and his attitude shifts from Indifferent to Unfriendly.

The Healer never attacks the PCs first. If the PCs attack him, however, he will do his best to subdue them.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 2, Safe

**Tactics:** The Healer calls upon his deity to protect him from the PCs, alternating between casting spells and attacking the nearest PC with his **+1 morningstar**. He casts *entropic ward* before a fight breaks out and *calm emotions* once things get heated.

**Treasure:** The medicinal herbs Healer carries heal 1d4+1 hit points each and he has enough medicine to make 2d12 doses for the PCs.

**Scaling:** N/A

## B62. THE RETIRED PACK LEADER

> Cramped and reeking of rotten meat, this small room is dominated by an aging goblinoid. Even seated, you can tell he is well over seven feet tall and a mass of fibrous muscles waiting to snap. His hair is gray and mottled, and deep scars line the bugbear's face, chest, and hands.

If the PCs do not surprise the bugbear, add the following:

> Staring at you from his perch, his one good eye searches deeply, curious about you. He seems to be having the same trouble reading you as you have reading him.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** The creature in this room is a bugbear named **Aughkin**. He is old and of no use in raiding parties. However, he has lived a long time, an indication of intelligence to this bugbear tribe. The others keep him here and rely on his wisdom and stories of past adventures to help plan bolder raids into the goblin expanses. While he would rather be in the thick of a raiding party, he is content to guide the younger bugbears to victory over the accursed goblins. He does not advise in matters he considers suicide, and whether the true leader or not, still treats his "men" with the dignity and respect due soldiers.

With a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check, the PCs can convince Aughkin they are not here to harm him or the bugbears. Aughkin and Healer (room B61) are willing to hear the PCs out and perhaps reach an agreement, but this requires roleplaying, not die rolling, and ultimately is the decision of the GM. Should they reach an accord, word spreads amongst the bugbears that the PCs can be trusted and the two groups should work together.

If attacked, or enraged, Aughkin attacks the PCs.

**Encounter Condition:** Fearless

**Tactics:** Aughkin would rather not fight, but he is not afraid of death. He has become a good advisor by thinking before he acts. If forced into battle, Aughkin does not hesitate, however. He launches himself at the PCs with a ferocity rarely seen in bugbears half his age. He gains the benefit of the barbarian's **Rage** feature for the duration of combat, despite not being a barbarian, and grapples the nearest PC he can find. If he gets a PC on the ground, Aughkin grabs ahold of the PC's neck and threatens to snap it if the others do not back off. Because of the size of Aughkin's hands, he deals 1d4+1 bludgeoning damage each turn while successfully grappling.

**Treasure:** Aughkin does not keep anything in his chambers that does not serve him in warfare. Clothing and magical aid are given to his men and for himself, he's kept a simple **+1 dagger**. If the PCs spend 30 minutes searching the room they manage to find an old journal (written in Goblin) that tells of his younger days as a soldier, and his recent years as a leader, unwilling to jeopardize his men.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two bugbears. To decrease the challenge, have Aughkin surrender if his grapple fails.

## B63. GOTCHA!

> Stark, this room is nearly identical to many rooms in the dungeon. The one feature that distinguishes it however is an intricate pattern of tiles on the floor. The tiles are covered in a layer of dust, however, and it is difficult to discern anything specific about them. Hanging on the wall, across from you, is a finely crafted spear.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The bugbears like to capture the occasional goblin, as they sometimes prove to be reliable sources of information. While the rest of the traps the bugbears have laid out in their domain are lethal, this room is not. Any goblins captured in this room are brought to Room B53 for interrogation.

The tiles on the floor are the trap's trigger, an alternating black and white pattern (like a checkerboard). PCs stepping on black tiles trigger a large net trap while stepping on white tiles is safe. To disable the trap the PCs must find a specific black tile in the southwest corner of the room where the trap's reset is located. Finding the tile is easy enough, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) (DC 14) check. However, lifting the tile and disarming the trap is another issue entirely. There are a series of twelve buttons, in three different colors (black, red, white) that must be depressed in a specific order. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check indicates that the buttons must be pressed in pairs. Failure on this check indicates that the colors are directly related to the tiles on the floor.

A second DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check indicates that the buttons must be pressed in order—red, black, and white. Failure on this check indicates the order is black, white, and red.

Lastly, the PCs are allowed a third check (this time at a DC 20) to determine the exact pairs that need to be depressed. If the PCs fail this check, they choose the wrong pair.

If a button is ever pressed out of order (or pressed in correspondence to the incorrect pair), the PC triggers a cantrip targeting the button-presser based on the color. The black button triggers a *chill touch*, the red button triggers *fire bolt*, and the white button *shocking grasp*. The cantrips are cast as if by a 1st level.

### Large Net Trap

When triggered a room-wide net made of bundled wire descends from the ceiling, catching all beneath it. PCs must succeed an Strength (Athletics) check (with a DC equal to their AC) for every 10 ft they wish to move underneath it. If the trap is disabled while it is active the net rises once more.

If more than 2 hours pass after the net is triggered a patrol of 1d3 bugbears investigates.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** PCs succeeding at a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check realize that the mechanism for protecting the large net is more complicated than the net itself, hinting that at one time the trap was more than just a net. Once the trap is disabled, the room is safe until the bugbears reset it (in 2d6 hours). It is recommended that the GM make the checks in private, lest the PCs get wise to the trap's function.

**Treasure:** The spear is a **featherweight spear**. It is the bait by which all goblins are tricked into entering this room. PCs that lifted the special black tile are allowed Wisdom (Perception) (DC 16) checks. Those who succeed realize that the buttons are built into a locking hinge that hides a compartment underneath. If they successfully disable all three traps, they can lift the mechanism (requires succeeding a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check) to find a pair of magical daggers. One of the daggers is an **angelbane dagger**, while the other is a **fairybane dagger**.

**Angelbane weapons** are +2 and magical when used against creatures that speak Celestial. **Fairybane daggers** are +2 and magical when used against creatures that understand Sylvan.

**Featherweight weapons** weigh half that of weapons bearing the same type, gain thrown (range 20/60), and use their versatile damage dice even when wielded with one hand.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, change the large net trap to a camouflaged pit trap (Room B40). To decrease the challenge, change the large net trap to a portcullis trap.

### Portcullis Trap

When triggered a portcullis slams down in front of the exit. Creatures underneath are skewered and crushed and must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13) or take 2d8 piercing and 2d8 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, creatures that fail to save are pinned underneath, preventing movement until freed. Any creature that can lift 200 lbs. of weight can reliably lift the gate 1 ft. off the ground, with the weight requirement doubling for each additional foot of distance desired. The gate will rise when the trap is reset.
