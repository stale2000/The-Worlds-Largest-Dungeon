# Region B (continued)

## B11: Cold Iron

> The granite walls are dull and lifeless and the floor looks slick with ice. In the middle of the room are three pieces of iron, shaped like links in a chain. As you approach, the iron links shift position with an audible groan. They shudder and with a violent screech of metal on metal, finally settle.

If the links are left alone for longer than a minute they twist and shift of their own accord, their screech taking on an accusatory edge.

After the PCs step into the room, read the following:

> The door slams behind you though the sound is well-masked by the iron links clattering in the room.

Attempts to catch the door require a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check to grab it and wrestle the door open. Any contact with the door before the puzzle is solved triggers a **chill touch** spell targeted at that creature (+7 to hit, 2d8 necrotic damage).

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Another of the puzzle traps placed by the celestials, this one is obviously a wrought iron riddle to be solved before the door will open.

The center of the three links holds the key to the door, but all three will lash out at any who approaches. Creatures "attacked" by the links must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC 14) or take 2d4 bludgeoning damage. The links will target the loudest creature in the room, straining to get at them even if they are out of reach, with no more than one link targeting someone at a time (the middle link is pulled around by the other two, and thus cannot lash out). The PCs must find a way to incapacitate, distract, or otherwise pacify the links to get the enchanted key that safely opens the door.

### Encounter Condition
Extreme Cold, Fear 12

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the save DCs of the iron link by 5 and have it inflict 1d4 extra cold damage for each failed saving throw. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, decrease the trap DCs by 3 and reduce the chill touch effect to a 1st-level caster (+5 to hit, 1d8 necrotic damage).

## B12: Snake Pit

The southern door to this room is locked and requires a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (DC 19) to unlock.

> The room is 20 feet wide, and 24 feet deep. A wide stone ledge is all you have to stand on, as the floor of the room drops off twenty feet into an unknown emptiness below. The floor writhes as dozens of snakes twist amongst sharpened metal spikes.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
Having malfunctioned the last time this trap was sprung, it has not been reset. A DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the goblinoid skeletons scattered beneath the snakes. Unless the PCs can reset the trap, they are forced to maneuver their way around the edge of the ledge with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check.

On the south wall, the PCs see a small stone switch with a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the PCs successfully strike the switch (AC 15) with a heavy blunt object (like a hammer) a small bridge springs out from the wall. Alternately, one PC can walk around and merely press the switch with a DC 8 Strength check. If the PCs entered from the south, then this is a no-brainer.

The bridge extends out at floor level and stops 10 feet short of the ledge. A successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check enables a PC to land on the bridge, but it cannot support more than one PC at a time. If a PC leaps onto the bridge with someone else standing on it, the bridge has a 50% chance of breaking, sending both PCs to the bottom of the pit. If a third PC jumps onto the bridge it automatically breaks.

PCs on the south side can attempt to repair the mechanism that drives the bridge, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) and follow up Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (Both DC 15) to salvage and replace the faulty gearing. Once fixed the bridge extends completely.

Failing the Dexterity check by more than 5 causes a malfunction and retracts the bridge 5 ft.

Once fixed, the bridge extends all the way to the ledge and supports three PCs at a time. From here, they can shuffle along the ledge, requiring a DC 14 Dexterity check to reach the exit in the southeast corner of the room. Since the southern door is locked, a PC must succeed at a DC 16 Dexterity check while trying to unlock the door. The mechanism is not overly complex, but the difficulty of trying to open the lock as well as maintaining balance makes the task difficult.

If the PCs try to pass one another on the ledge, everyone involved must succeed at a DC 15 Dexterity check, +2 per PC. Failure on any balance check indicates the PC falls. Failure by more than 10 means he takes someone else with him.

There is another, less obvious option, for getting across this room. Five feet below the level of the floor, the PCs—with a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check—can discern a groove running along the wall of the room. Inside this groove is a 6-in.-thick floor that extends across the pit, if the PCs can disable the trigger to the trap.

The trigger is located to the left of the entryway, where the wall and floor would meet if the trap was set. The PCs can find it with a successful DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check. A DC 16 Dexterity check allows a PC to reach the trigger and two consecutive Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) are required to reset the trap (DC 14), and then disable it (DC 18). Once the floor is back in place, the PCs can walk across the room without fail.

If any PCs fall into the pit, their best course of action is to climb out. Since the walls are rough and provide handholds, the PCs can reach the ledge easily with a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
If any PCs fall into the pit, six snakes (medium vipers) attack each round. While there are dozens and dozens of snakes they do not have a true strategy and they tend to lash out blindly.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter increase Dexterity check DCs by +2 and add 20 ft. of depth to the fall. To decrease the challenge, decrease all Wisdom (Perception) DCs by -4.

## B13: Well of Sleep

If the PCs approach from the hallway, read the following:

> As you enter this chamber, you see four doors. In the southeast corner of the room is a silver door. Its shine nearly blinds you. In the southwest corner of the small antechamber stands a door of dark wood, stained with age. In the northwest corner is a simple stone door and in the northeast corner, a finely carved stone door catches your eye.

If the PCs entered from Room B8, read the following:

> The stone door rises, awaiting your entry. As you enter the room, the stone door lowers behind you, gracefully.

Once the PCs open the door to Room B13, read the following:

> The room is built with polished stone. The yellow hue is as clean as it is even. A simple wooden frame hangs above the well, and a frayed rope descends into the inky blackness below. Echoes rise from the pit, as you hear scurrying noises and a splash of water.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
This room is an enigma. What the celestials intended for it is known only to its creator, who is dead. It is now the home of a few vermin who climb up and down the wall of the pit. From time to time the goblins come here as well, hoping to catch something to play with.

If the PCs touch the rope, an **alarm** spell sounds, alerting the goblins that someone is here. Allow the goblin fighters in Room B70 a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check. If successful, they come running to the commotion in 8d4 seconds, expecting to find bugs and rats.

### Encounter Condition
[Ambush], Stagnant Air

### Tactics
The goblins swarm into the room expecting trouble, but instead find the PCs. The goblins suffer a -4 penalty to their initiative rolls for 1d4 minutes. The goblins gang up in pairs, however, and if any PC poses the largest threat, the goblins send their "extras" to deal with them.

When the goblins are dispatched the PCs are free to gather water from the well to replenish their stores, but it needs to be purified before it can be safely drunk. If the PCs imbibe the water before purifying it they must succeed a Constitution saving throw (DC 16) or have their maximum hit points reduced by 3d4 until their next long rest.

The secret door leading to Room B8 cannot be opened from this side.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the alarm sound when one of the doors is opened. To decrease the challenge, the alarm only sounds if the rope is pulled.

---

## B14: Obelisk of Shapes

> As you enter this chamber, you encounter four doors. In the southeast corner of the room is a silver door, polished to a nearly blinding shine. In the southwest corner of the small antechamber stands a dark wood door, stained with age. In the northwest corner is a simple stone door, and in the northeast corner a finely carved stone door is the last to catch your eye.

Once the PCs open the door to Room B14, read the following:

> The walls of this room are a dull gray granite. The floor and ceiling are granite as well, but are highly polished. An obsidian obelisk dominates the center of the room. Carved into the obelisk are various shaped holes—circles, squares, and triangles among many others. In a swarm around it spin trinkets of varying shapes.

After the PCs step into the room, read the following:

> The doors to the room slam shut as the shapes on the obelisk grind to a halt.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Similar to Room B6, this trap keeps the PCs in the room until it is reset. The puzzle is simple, meant to test the most basic of problem-solving skills. Each hole on the obelisk has a shape that corresponds with it. Once it is filled the doors spring open.

Feel free to describe the puzzle in as agonizing detail as you like. Lead the players on with the depth and complexity of the strangely shaped necklaces and baubles that float around.

If someone wants to, they may perform whatever checks they deem fit for divining the nature of this obelisk. In case someone happens to roll higher than a 15 on an Wisdom (Insight) check, clue them in on the fact that there are an equal number of holes to objects.

The objects themselves are not magical, just held aloft with weak enchantments. The obelisk itself is not enchanted, instead hiding minuscule mechanical switches inside each slot that the correct object actuates.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
It is not recommended to increase the challenge of this encounter. It is a simple puzzle meant to foil creatures with animalistic minds. To decrease the challenge, merely have the door open after 24 hours.

## B15: Blink Dog Den

The stone door in the southeastern corner is jammed, requiring a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unstick, followed by a successful DC 9 Strength (Athletics Check).

> Musty odors permeate the air here. The floor is littered with bones and scraps of cloth. Near the southwestern corner, in front of a large stone door, are the bodies of three hounds and a few goblins. Broken spears and ruined shields are strewn about the floor here as well. In the northeastern corner of the room is yet another stone door. This area is free of detritus.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
One of many rooms that have been taken over as a den by the blink dogs, it was recently sacked by a goblin war party. Aside from the remains of the battle, there is little of note in this room.

### Encounter Condition
Echoes 4, Distracting Visions

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
Amidst the debris, the PCs can find two wolf teeth, a very small, jagged gold tooth (from a goblin), and a severed, desiccated hand.

### Scaling
N/A

## B16: Hall of the Divine

> Constructed of blinding white marble walls, and highly polished black granite, this room's southeastern corner is a mess of gears and pulleys. The marble wall has been smashed open and the innards of a complex trap spill out of it. A huge statue of a ferocious angel (obviously female) wielding an ornate spear, dominates the wall. The statue is masterfully crafted, it's almost lifelike and the spear is real, placed into the right hand of the statue.

If the PCs examine the statue, read the following:

> At the base of the statue is a plaque that reads, "I shall defend this prison against all manner of evil. I shall die to protect this world from the horrors of the abyss. I shall never waiver. I shall never stop my quest to liberate the world from the taint of chaos. I shall never concede defeat."

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Ages ago, when the bugbears were far more prominent, they defended this room against intruders, considering the beautiful statue a herald of what was to come. Little did they know, the angel was actually buried in the room, her remains used to build the foundation of a shrine to their greatest warrior. When any PCs step within 5 ft. of the statue, they must succeed a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12) or be frightened of the statue for 24 hours, followed by the summoning of two **lantern archons**, coming out of the eyes of the statue.

They immediately determine the alignment of the PCs. Either use the listed alignments on their character sheets, or judge for yourself what the party's alignment predominantly leans towards. If they are deemed to have strayed too far from "lawful" or "good" then the archons summon a **blink dog** to defend the room.

### Encounter Condition
Fear 14, Positive Energy

### Tactics
The lantern archons are mindless drones, created by the spirit of the angel who died here. The blink dogs are also made of the same celestial energy and attack mindlessly. They attack evil PCs first, followed by chaotic neutral, neutral, and finally chaotic good PCs (of questionable character).

Lawful good, lawful neutral, and neutral good PCs cannot harm these creatures. Conversely, lawful good PCs are immune to the frightened condition in this room. If any PC moves toward the statue or touches the spear, the blink dog and lantern archons attack them, ignoring alignment.

If the creatures in this room are killed, they fade like mist. If you would like, consider any paladin, no matter their chosen alignment, to be "lawful" alignment given their staunch adherence to their oath. An oath-breaker would be exempt for... obvious reasons. In fact the archons may judge an oath-breaker quite harshly.

### Treasure
The statue is armed with a **+1 "axiomatic" spear**. Lawful good PCs can collect it, if they recite the sacred oath written at the bottom of the statue. Should the PC ever fail in this oath, the spear disintegrates.

When rolling damage for an axiomatic item, if the target is of any chaotic alignment, remove an additional 1d4 hit points from that creature. Non-lawful good PCs touching an axiomatic item suffer 2d6 lightning damage per turn spent in contact.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, the lantern archons are summoned as soon as the PCs enter the room. To decrease the challenge, allow any PCs to fight the lantern archons and blink dog, but lose their immunity to the frightened condition.

---

## B17: Trapped Blink Dogs

> As you open the door to this room, a sense of unease comes over you. The room is plain and square. It is dark, though your torches cut through the gloom easily enough. A musky scent wafts through the air, and you get the distinct impression you are not the only one in this room.

If the PCs enter without being noticed, read this:

> Three yellow-brown dogs, nearly identical to the corpses in the other room, lie on the floor sleeping lazily. They haven't noticed you yet, but something is unnerving them. The dogs shiver quietly with fear, whining softly from time to time.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
Three blink dogs were driven into this room by a goblin scouting party a few weeks ago. The room's Aura of Fear has them trapped.

> **Aura of Fear.** Creatures within the room must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw every turn or be frightened of everything outside of the room.

If the dogs notice the PCs they immediately attack, taking out their frustrations on the party. If the party lingers in the doorway, the blink dogs have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to spot them. If the PCs make enough noise in B15 to draw their attention the dogs investigate. Should the PCs be spotted then, the blink dogs attack, mistaking the PCs for those who trapped them in the first place.

If killed, the blink dogs fade like mist.

### Encounter Condition
Ambush, Fear 16

### Tactics
The blink dogs launch themselves at the PCs indiscriminately. Where they would normally attack the PCs individually—concentrating their attacks—they lash out at the closest PC. Because of the nature of the dungeon, their blink ability is sporadic and has a 70% chance of failing. If successful, however, they flank the hapless PC. Blink dogs are lawful good creatures, and thus are easier to reason with using animal handling. If the PCs calm the blink dogs, the blink dogs leave the room, but do not become companions to the PCs. This ordeal has left them a little confused and they move on through the dungeon without much direction. If the PCs follow, the blink dogs investigate Room B14 briefly, and then make their way through the rest of the Section.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one blink dog. To decrease the challenge, remove one.

---

## B18: Room of Fire

The door to this room is locked, requiring a successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. When a PC opens the door they are hit with a wave of heat that deals 1d2 points of fire damage. After that, the Extreme Heat condition takes effect if the PCs enter the room.

> This room is hot, close to oppressively so. The walls are constructed of granite with large scorch marks and stains. The corners contain small piles of ash. Against the northern wall, a simple pedestal rests, with a scroll case on top.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The oppressive heat is a design of the room and should be an indication of the inhospitable conditions. While there is no illusion, **detect magic** reveals faint illusion magic on the walls and pedestal. This is meant to distract visitors and the GM should play up the illusion's design with vague answers to the PC's questions. Keep them in the room as long as possible, examining every corner.

With 1d6 minutes of examinations and a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveal that no illusion actually exists and the heat is real.

### Encounter Condition
Extreme Heat

### Tactics
The scroll case is the only thing of interest in this room and touching it triggers a fireball trap that engulfs the room.

> **Fireball Trap.** When the cap of the scroll case is placed upon any surface other than the case itself it casts a **fireball** spell at 3rd level at its location, with a spell save DC of 14. Should the trap trigger, the scroll case is destroyed, along with the trap, and scroll if its still inside. A successful Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 16) reveals the fireball spell's runes etched into the cap's rim. This trap may be disarmed by casting **dispel magic** on the scroll cap. Should the PCs succeed the Intelligence (Arcana) check by a substantial amount you may opt to reveal the exact nature of the trigger, and that the trap and case might be saved for later use.

Seventy-two hours after being triggered and disintegrating the scroll case manifests again in the room, armed, and with a fresh fire trap scroll inside.

### Treasure
Coincidentally, the scroll inside the case contains a stronger version of this rooms trap, a **scroll of fire trap**.

**Fire trap** is a variant of the **alarm** spell, with the twist that triggering the associated alarm casts the **fireball** spell at 3rd level at its location, with a spell save DC of 14. It requires a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot. Succeeding a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals the magical phrase to disable the fire trap for 5 minutes. When spoken within earshot, the alarm's trigger cannot activate for that time. Once triggered the trap cannot cast fireball again.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, change the trap and scroll to cast **flame strike**. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, change the trap and scroll to cast **burning hands**.

---

## B19: Room of Rot

The door to this room is locked, requiring a successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. When a PC opens the door they are hit with a stench of decay that requires succeeding a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, lest the PC become poisoned. After that, the Stagnant Air condition takes effect if the PCs enter the room.

> This room reeks of decay. The smell is overpowering, practically debilitating and the room is cramped. The stone walls are covered in decaying moss and dark stains. Across from the door, a pedestal stands with an ornate scroll case on it. As enticing as the scroll case may seem, the stench threatens to completely overwhelm you.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Like Room B18, this room suffers from an unexplained odor that chokes the PCs as they enter. The stench is actually a design of the room (or a malfunction of the magical wards), not residue from the trap located on the pedestal. It would be easy to say this room is an anomaly, but this entire Region plays upon the experimental traps to the point that nothing should shock the PCs.

### Encounter Condition
Stagnant Air

### Tactics
Aside from the Stagnant Air, the PCs also have to deal with a trap if they wish to remove the scroll case from the room.

> **Noxious Vapor Trap.** The scroll case has two caps, one on each end. Of the two, one spins freely, as if it wants to be opened, popping off easily and triggering the trap. The other produces a grinding sound when spun and can be depressed as well as pulled off. PCs that succeed a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hear a soft click when pressing down on this cap.
>
> If this cap is depressed while opening the other the trap is disarmed permanently. Opening from this end still triggers the trap.
>
> Removing the case from the room without disarming the trap triggers a noxious vapor that floods the room, poisoning any PCs inside that fail a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Once triggered the scroll case melts into a puddle of goo, ruining the scroll if it is still inside. After 72 hours have passed since it was triggered the scroll case manifests once more on its pedestal, loaded with a new scroll.

### Treasure
The scroll case contains a **scroll of stinking cloud**.

### Scaling
N/A

## B20: Limestone Cavern

As the PCs approach this room, they can see water making out from under the door. The door to this room is locked, requiring a successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.

> The entire floor of the room is submerged. Looking about, you notice the lack of construction here. The walls are unfinished limestone and stalactites hang from the ceiling. Droplets of water fall from the high ceiling, and the walls are slick. Almost floating on the water, resting on a stone, is a gem set into the wall, pulsating with a bright-yellow glow.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The entire floor of this room is sunken and filled with 4 ft. of water, which is icy cold. A 6 in. lip runs the course of the room, but standing or walking on it requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check or the PC falls into the water. Falling into the water causes no damage, but it is extremely cold. Light does not penetrate the water either, but cupping it into one's hand reveals that it is crystal clear. The bottom is uneven and rocky, making it difficult to cross easily.

### Encounter Condition
[Extreme Cold], Flooded, Hazardous Footing 15

### Tactics
Touching the jewel casts **lightning bolt** at 3rd level towards the PC. Due to the flooded condition of the room, the Dexterity save DC is 16. This happens only once, and **dispel magic** will remove the hostile enchantment without harming the item.

### Treasure
The gem is a beautifully cut diamond, worth about 2,000 gp. While it does not radiate magic it grants resistance to cold damage, so long as the gem is held tightly in one's hand. It can be safely removed once the trap is disabled.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, change the **lightning bolt** spell to **chain lightning**. To decrease the challenge, reduce the DC of Dexterity save of the lightning bolt trap by 4.

---

## B21: Columns

The door to this room is locked, requiring a successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.

> Stone columns run from floor to ceiling. The columns are carved with symbols from an ancient language you can't quite discern, as well as graffiti left behind by the vagabond goblinoid races. The rapid scrawling of goblins and the heavier script of bugbears can be easily discerned. The columns in the back of the room are in better condition than the ones closest to the door. The floor of the room is littered with debris and small rocks.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The carvings on the columns depict the story of how the Region was built from the perspective of a scholar. It is a signature (of sorts) by one of the celestial designers. The graffiti covering the columns was created by the goblins and bugbears, and in a way details their history, though it is difficult to read as they often overlap and obscure each other. To ensure the room remained a testament to their work, the celestial incorporated a trap into the columns. Apparently, the goblinoids have not been deterred from spoiling the unique architecture of the columns, trap or no. The PCs may freely examine the columns, so long as they do not touch them. Once a column is touched the trap triggers and the columns collapse on the PCs. The trap resets once the room is void of life.

> **Collapsing Columns.** While appearing steady, the columns are packed with magic and ready to fall at any moment. Any touch of a living creature triggers their descent. Creatures within 5 ft., including the offending creature, must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by the stonework launched at them. Creatures that fail their save receive 4d8 bludgeoning damage.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
If the PCs spend 30 minutes searching the debris in this room, allow each of them a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find one of the following: 24 copper coins in a brown leather bag, a gold ring that radiates illusion magic but produces no effect, a masterwork silver dagger, a pair of rusted kukri, or a **scroll of mending**. Once all four items are found all the PCs find are pieces of wood, bone fragments, stones, and fungus.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, have a wall of the room collapse inward instead, striking all creatures within 10 ft. of that wall. To decrease the challenge, have the column instead drop a large brick from the ceiling, only striking the triggering creature.

---

## B22: Dire Wolf Den

> This room is dark, so dark in fact that your torches cannot pierce the gloom. The few things you can make out are merely shadows dancing in the corner. The smell of decay fills the air.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
The PCs have stumbled into another dire wolf den. Four dire wolves are on edge due to recent goblin raids, and are prepared for any intruders that enter their den. The wolves gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, attacking the PCs on sight.

### Encounter Condition
Ambush, Deep Darkness, Fearless

### Tactics
The wolves use pack tactics, swarming over one PC at a time. They do not target any PC specifically, attacking whichever is most accessible. Two wolves attempt to flank the target, while the others assault the PC directly. Attempts to sway the animals through Animal Handling are done at disadvantage.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two dire wolves. To decrease the challenge, remove one dire wolf.

---

## B23: The Pit

> A deep, circular pit dominates the center of this room. Leaning over it, you can see nothing but darkness down the treacherous well. The corpse of a bugbear lies against the northern wall, a gleaming battleaxe clutched loosely in its hand. In the other corner of the room, sunk halfway through the floor, is a sword. The echo of the wind gushing through the pit makes an ominous sound as you move cautiously about the room.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
There are two pits in this room. The first is obvious. The second is located directly behind the sword; it has become lodged between the two sections of the trap's door. Unless they disable the trap first, any PC that steps within 10 ft. of the sword triggers the trap and they fall down into the 20-ft-deep pit. A successful DC 17 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check is required by any PCs who fall down the pit to escape from it.

PCs that roll higher than a 14 on Wisdom (Perception) checks in this room notice seams in the floor that a slight breeze wafts through. Disabling the hidden pit trap requires sabotaging the seams around the edge of it, performed by succeeding a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check with the right tools.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
The axe the corpse of the bugbear clutches is a **+1 greataxe** that always glows with a 5 ft. radius of dim light. No effort, physical or magical, succeeds in snuffing the light. If the PCs manage to recover the sword, it is a **bastard sword**, with the name *Urthieln* engraved in the blade (in Celestial runes).

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the depth of the hidden pit trap to 30 ft. To decrease the challenge, lower the DC of the climb by -4.

---

## B24: Blocked Hall

> You see a collapsed door in the distance. It appears as if a large stone block fell from the ceiling and utterly crushed it. The ceiling, however, looks complete and lacks any distinguishing characteristics. The hallway branches both east and west in front of the door.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The PCs are near one of the celestials' observatories. In order to safeguard their private enclosure, the celestials installed a trap here. The trap only has one activation left and the goblins know to avoid it, having seen its devastating effect before. The eastern branch of the corridor leads to Room B22. The western branch terminates at a blank wall. A DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals a small (3 in. diameter, 3 in. deep) hole in the wall (part of a secret door leading to Room B25) 4 ft. from the floor.

> **Falling Block Trap.** When the PCs enter this room have them roll a Wisdom (Perception) check. Anyone who rolls higher than an 8 notices primitive markings across the various tiles that make up the floor. PCs that roll higher than a 14, or possess knowledge of goblinoid customs, find a pattern amongst them. It is spaced evenly enough to be walked by small folk. Straying from this path triggers the trap. If the PCs do not find the path, each roll 1d6. On a roll of 1-4 they have triggered the trap. Triggering the trap causes a huge block to fall from the ceiling, crushing any PCs who fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw for 6d4 bludgeoning damage.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
The secret door can only be opened by placing a dowel or iron rod into the hole in the wall and lifting up. No Strength check is required. Without a handle to lift, the PCs must succeed at a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check to lift the secret door open.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the damage of the falling block trap to 6d6. To decrease the challenge, lower the damage to 6d3.

---

## B25: Observatory

The secret door leading to this room can only be opened by placing a 3-in.-diameter dowel or iron rod into a hole in the wall 4 ft. high and lifting. No Strength check is required. Without a handle to lift, the PCs must succeed at a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check to lift the secret door open.

> A few nondescript wooden benches are in the room. On the back wall a large map hangs limply. It looks old, though it is in good repair. The map details the layout of this entire section of the dungeon. There is a simple stone door to the south.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This room was used as an observatory by the celestials. Aside from the map (see treasure below), it contains nothing of much interest or value. The air in the room is dry and fire spreads easily, consuming the benches and map within minutes if the fire cannot be extinguished. The door to the south leads to Room B26. It is locked, requiring a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 16) to pick. The doorknob is covered in a thin, almost imperceptible, layer of contact poison. It must be dealt with if the PCs wish to open the door.

> **Contact Poison.** Touching the poison causes near-instantaneous burning and vicious nausea. The victim loses 1d6 hit points immediately, and must succeed a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose another 2d6 hit points every 10 hours until their next long rest.

### Encounter Condition
Echoes 4

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
The map on the back wall is a duplicate of Map B. It can assist the PCs in navigating the dungeon. It is quite old, and easily catches fire if the PCs are not careful. It is also large, measuring 10-ft-by-10-ft. The map does not show the location of secret doors, but it does show the location of every room in the dungeon. It is unlabeled.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, raise the DC of the Constitution save of the trap by 5. To decrease the challenge, reduce the poison's recurring damage to 1d6.

## B26: Observatory Library

> As you enter the room you notice it is similar to one of the rooms near the dungeon's entrance. Along the back wall is a stone desk and chair, and a bookcase covers the eastern wall. In this room, however, the bookcase holds a number of tomes, not just one or two. A sheaf of papers lies on the desk, and the light glints off of something metallic under the chair.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The room is essentially a mirror of Room B3. The anteroom (Room B25) served as an observation post for the celestials, while this room was used to catalog their findings. The catalogued observations are stored on the bookshelf, written on ancient parchment. Not wishing for their records to fall into the wrong hands, this room was trapped by the celestial observers. The shiny object under the chair, which appears to be a silver brooch, is the trigger for a fire trap (see Room B18). Any attempt to move the broach triggers the trap, which destroys every book in the room beyond any hope of repair; the flames easily consume the ancient pages. The trap is also triggered if the PCs attempt to remove any of the books from the room without first disabling the trap.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
If the PCs do not trigger the trap, they are free to take as many books with them as they can carry. The books, and the sheaves of paper on the desk, chronicle events of the devils over centuries, though no specific dates are given. To understand the writing, a PC must speak Celestial and succeed a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation check). The PCs are free to take the silver broach, which is worth approximately 100 gp, once the trap is disabled. If the trap is triggered, the broach is destroyed in the ensuing flames.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, change the fire trap to cast **flame strike** at 6th level. To decrease the challenge, change the fire trap to cast **burning hands** at 2nd level.

## B27: Hall of Vines

> This room is covered in vines, lending it an earthy smell. Beneath the plants, you can barely make out a series of strange stones. The room is separated into three square sections and a layer of ash blankets the granite floor tiles. In the center is a thin pedestal with a bright gem affixed to it. The pedestal has strange sigils carved into its base, though they appear worn down and cannot be clearly read. The only apparent exit is the door you entered through.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The sigils under the vines, and on the pedestal, are **glyphs of warding** (3rd level, explosive, acid). If the PCs touch any wall, or the gem on the pedestal, the ward triggers, which withers the vines and ivy that have accumulated in the room over time. Each wall has its own ward, and each must be disabled individually to investigate the sigils.

### Encounter Condition
[Safe]

### Tactics
There is a secret door in the southwestern corner of the room that leads to a corridor which leads to Room B29. A successful DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals a small, rough "button" that blends in with the stone. However, a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check dislodges the button from the surrounding moss and vines, without damaging the mechanism or triggering the glyph. Once the button is depressed, the wall slides down and into the floor, which also deactivates the glyphs for 6d10 seconds before the secret door closes again, and the traps reset.

Without the button, disabling any glyph of warding here requires a successful Arcana (DC 15) check, or just triggering them. The resulting acid-blast only harms the vines... and the PCs who bumble into them.

### Treasure
Once the trap on the pedestal is disabled, the PCs can remove the gem. It is a small sapphire worth approximately 600 gp. A PC spending an hour deciphering the sigils on the wall is rewarded a spell (that can be transcribed into a spellbook) if they succeed a DC 23 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The GM should choose an appropriate 3rd-level spell the PCs are lacking.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the damage of the glyph of warding trap to 7d8 acid. To decrease the challenge, lower the damage to 4d8 acid.

## B28: Excavated Room

> The walls of this room are heavily damaged. Large sections of masonry are scattered all over the floor, and a few blunt pickaxes are left in the rubble. The room is musty and uninviting.

If the PCs have not killed Bartleby the Halfling, read the following:

> From the northwestern corner of the room you hear grunts and scratching. As you get closer the noises stop and the raspy, uninviting voice yells out, "Git outta here! This is my claim!"

### Initial Attitude
Unfriendly

### Encounter
**Bartleby the Halfling** has taken up residence in this room. If the PCs have encountered him previously, his attitude is Indifferent, though he is gruff and suspicious. He presumes the PCs are following him, hoping to find the treasure he seeks before he can. If the PCs have not encountered Bartleby before, he questions them intently, trying to determine their purpose in the dungeon. He is elusive with his answers, and does not give his purpose away. If the PCs do not attack Bartleby, he claims the room is empty and has no more secrets to be uncovered and leaves, heading towards Room B38. He wants nothing to do with the PCs and offers no assistance nor accepts any in return.

Once Bartleby leaves the room, or has been killed, the PCs can investigate further. Bartleby has destroyed the surface of the walls. The innards of a trap can be seen in the northern wall, but it is obvious that Bartleby has ruined it beyond repair. A successful DC 23 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check reveals the trap was once a fire trap (Room B18), but otherwise it is unidentifiable. On the southern wall is a secret door that leads to Room B29. It is difficult to spot, requiring a successful DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find. Like the secret door in Room B27, a simple button lowers the door into the floor for 2d6 rounds, during which time the trap that used to be in this room would be disarmed. Despite the damage to the wall, the secret door opens easily.

### Encounter Condition
Ambush, Concealment, Cover

### Tactics
Bartleby attempts to scare off the PCs. He uses alchemical substances to distract them, such as acid, alchemical fire, and thunderstones (thrown weapons, dexterity to hit, deals 3d4 acid/fire/thunder damage to creatures within 5 ft. of the target if it hits. DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage). If he cannot drive them from the room he flees deeper into the dungeon. Once in the dungeon, he heads towards Room B38. He knows the dungeon far better than the PCs and easily loses them once free of the room. Feel free to play this out, however, with Bartleby heading into trapped rooms and sneaking through secret doors.

### Treasure
Bartleby keeps a bedroll, a small lamp, and a few pots and pans. However, any belongings of value are on his person.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter use the improved versions of Bartleby's rogue abilities listed under "Difficulty Increase." In addition, you may have Bartleby throw his alchemical weapons as a bonus action if you'd like.

## B29: The Room of Wands

> This room's walls are covered with wands. Each one looks masterfully crafted. You can't see any hooks, so magic must be holding the wands to the walls. The walls behind the wands are covered with thick, green moss. The floor and ceiling are free of the moss, and are polished blue marble.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Another in a series of maddening traps designed by the celestials, this room only has one useful wand: a **wand of burning hands**. The rest of the wands, while nicely crafted, are simple wooden decoys with an illusory magic aura. If the PCs cast **detect magic**, everything in the room radiates magic and every school of magic is present. PCs who roll higher than a 15 on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to study the wands see through the illusory magic schools, and discern the wands to be all illusion magic. This reveals nothing further about them, just that the schools of magic they were enchanted with were fake. PCs that touch these fake wands who have proven themselves sufficiently chaotic or evil (or who bear those alignments if you prefer) have **bestow curse** (spell save DC 14) cast on them at 3rd level, choosing a random ability score to curse, and lasting for 24 hours.

The true wand is basically impossible to find amongst the multitude without testing each one. It is up to your discretion for how to handle that. Sufficiently stubborn PCs could brute force the hundreds of wands to find it. If a PC can see magic, and succeeds at a DC 15 (21 if they have yet to properly discern their spell schools) Intelligence (Investigation) check they find the odd one out.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
The northern wall contains a secret door that leads to Room B28. A Wisdom (Perception) check rolls of 17 or greater within the room reveal the well hidden door. It is unlocked and opens easily.

### Treasure
The PC can retrieve one **wand of burning hands**. It has 1 charge and casts at 3rd level.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, allow PCs to trigger the curse regardless of alignment. To decrease the challenge, change the **bestow curse** to **bane**. The duration and spell save DC remain the same.
