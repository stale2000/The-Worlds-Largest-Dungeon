# Region C (continued)

## C53. Arum's Private Sanctum

A wide bed covered with dusty blankets lies at the foot of the southern wall of this chamber. Beside the bed is a wooden table with a lantern on it. There is an iron chest at the foot of the bed. Its locking mechanism is clearly visible from the room's only entrance.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This chamber was Arum's private bedroom. When the wizard left the dungeon, he abandoned some of his personal effects, but did not deactivate the trap he placed here. Judging by the dust covering everything in this room, it is clear that no one has visited in a long time.

The doorway leading to Arum's chamber is rigged with a magical trap (something Arum doesn't even remember doing). Anyone entering the room must make a DC 13 Wisdom save or suffer from the bestow curse trap. The trap automatically resets after 6 rounds. It can affect the same person more than once.

**Bestow Curse Trap**
- **Detect:** DC 19 Intelligence (Arcana)
- **Disable:** DC 19 Intelligence (Arcana)
- **Effect:** Characters entering the room must make a DC 13 Wisdom save or have disadvantage on all Wisdom ability checks and saving throws for 24 hours.

**Encounter Condition:** Cursed 5, Haunted

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The chest at the foot of the bed is locked and requires a DC 22 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to open. It contains two blank spell books, three sets of wizard's robes in various shades of blue, and six oil flasks. The lantern upon the table is still in good shape. Copper and silver coins with the faces melted off are scattered along the bottom of the chest.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the bestow curse trap affect Intelligence as well as Wisdom. To decrease the challenge, replace the bestow curse trap with a burning hands trap.

## C54. Ghastly Guard Post

Half a dozen gnoll carcasses lie in the middle of this dark room. A closer look at the corpses indicates these warriors died years ago in brutal combat. The weapons they wielded remain with them.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This chamber was once a guard post used by the members of the tribe. The bodies are six gnolls from the Gnashing Fang Tribe. These creatures died at the hands of a powerful hill giant that ventured into this section. The tribe abandoned this room shortly after this battle, leaving the dead behind.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Visions

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** PCs searching the corpses find three rusty great axes, two great clubs, a morningstar, and four large steel shields. One of these shields is a masterwork item. The gnolls also carry a total of 21 gp worth of semiprecious gemstones and coins.

**Scaling:** N/A

## C55. Rigged False Door

Four doors open into this dark intersection. Though the three doors set amidst the three different eastern walls do not seem to lock, a black iron lock is set in the one at the end of the western corridor.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The door at the end of the western corridor is false. It is set in the stone of the wall and cannot be opened, but it nevertheless contains a complex locking mechanism. The western door is also trapped. It was designed to fool the inhabitants into believing that some powerful creature was imprisoned on the other side. A successful DC 21 Dexterity check is enough to unlock the mechanism upon the door, but it can unfortunately not be opened. Anyone touching the door or lock also triggers its deadly magical trap.

**Cloudkill Trap**
- **Detect:** DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana)
- **Disable:** DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana)
- **Effect:** Characters in a 20-ft. sphere must make a DC 15 Constitution save for half damage or suffer 5d8 poison damage.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a cone of cold to the cloudkill trap. To decrease the challenge, replace the cloudkill trap with a slow trap; its effect lasts 1 day.

---

## C56. Flooding Room

The floor of this intersecting corridor is surprisingly clean, but there is a layer of green moss covering the walls, which forms an almost straight line around the room some three feet from the floor.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This intersection is rigged with a potent flooding room trap. Unfortunately, the powerful earthquakes that modified parts of the dungeon also damaged this device.

Four rounds after the PCs enter this room, the doors shut tightly and loud clicking sounds are heard as they are locked into place. Water then pours from minuscule cracks upon the floor, forming a pool in the room. The water rises at a rate of 1 ft. per round, but fortunately for travelers, the trap is not as effective as it once was, and the water stops rising after three rounds (at the level where the moss can be seen). The sound of running water continues to be heard until 10 rounds elapse. At the end of this period, everything is quiet for 15 minutes before the water level drops. 10 additional rounds later, the water dissipates, and the doors instantly unlock themselves.

PCs unlocking any of the doors must succeed at a DC 23 Dexterity check or remain trapped inside the room. Disarming the trap requires a DC 25 Dexterity check, which prevents the doors from shutting on their own as well as preventing water from pouring into the corridor.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises 6, Flooded

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## C57. Hazardous Tunnel

A narrow tunnel was dug from the bedrock of the dungeon, connecting two small chambers together. The uneven corridor and the rooms it connects are filled with a multitude of stone debris. It's clear the stone boulders tumbled from the walls and ceiling.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Demons imprisoned in the dungeon dug a tunnel linking both ends of this room, which were once separate. The demons eventually escaped when the geography of the dungeon changed, centuries ago. Now, however, this room is a dangerous place to be and the ceiling looks like it could collapse at any moment.

PCs examining this room notice the precarious state of the place. A successful DC Intelligence check confirms that journeying through this place is dangerous and might result in an avalanche.

PCs moving through this room must do so carefully. They must succeed at a DC 15 Dexterity check to avoid a cave-in. Each PC failing this check causes several large blocks of stone to fall to the ground, dealing 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage to everyone in the room. This damage is cumulative, so anyone else failing the check adds another 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage. PCs succeeding at a DC 15 Dexterity save cut the damage in half.

**Encounter Condition:** Tremors 18

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, double the damage caused by the cave-in. To decrease the challenge, no extra damage is suffered if more than one PC fails his Dexterity check.

---

## C58. Sacked Bed Chamber

This room is filled with debris. There are many broken wood poles and planks, the remnants of a bed, as well as the broken remains of a small cabinet. The wooden pieces are scattered about the room, and it is obvious that someone, or something, smashed everything here.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This chamber once housed the only healer of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. This wise old gnoll died long ago, however, and his bedroom was sacked. PCs looking at the debris also find several strips of rotted cotton as well as the dusty remains of dried herbs. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check made here confirms that these items were once part of a large healer's kit.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** A successful DC 23 Wisdom (Perception) check through the debris here reveals a universal solvent and two potions of superior healing.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## C59. Hall of Mirages

This room is unlike anything encountered previously. The walls are made out of dark brown whole wooden logs, reminiscent of a comfortable log cabin. Upon the southern wall is a thick frame made of red bricks that outline a hearth. Flames burn within the hearth, raising the temperature of the room to a comfortable level. There are tables around the room, as well as stools, and the trophies of various hunting trips hanging on the walls.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Arum set a powerful illusion into this hall, as well as a lethal trap. This great chamber is reminiscent of a tavern, though without a bar or barkeep. Arum placed a powerful illusion here, and a DC 21 Intelligence save reveals that this room is, like most in the dungeon, cut from stone. Those who fail believe it to be a tavern, complete with darts, drinks, kegs, and the like. The room is totally empty, and the stone floor is cloaked in dust. PCs walking 10 ft. or more release a magical trap, which affects everyone one round later.

**Phantasmal Killer Trap**
- **Detect:** DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana)
- **Disable:** DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana)
- **Effect:** Characters entering room DC 18 Wisdom save or suffer from phantasmal killer.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add fear to each phantasmal killer trap. To decrease the challenge, have the phantasmal killer trap target only a single creature.

## C60-C68. Path of the Righteous

This section was originally designed as a deadly path preventing demonic and devilish creatures from venturing too far. The angel and archon wardens of the region could safely walk from Rooms C60 though Room C68 and even used some of these chambers to rest. However, non-lawful good creatures found it more difficult to make the journey.

When Arum discovered this area, he essentially kept it as it was. However, he used Room C64 to honor the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives in the service of their god and who died fighting the powerful demon of the dungeon. Arum's testimony of the paladin's battle is engraved upon the walls of this chamber in a maddeningly random combination of Common, Draconic, and Abyssal.

PCs will notice that the stone surfaces of the walls, floor, and ceiling are whiter in Rooms C61-C67. In addition, the material from which they had been hewn is different than in other parts of the vast complex and no dust has accumulated anywhere. Lastly, the spotless white stone surfaces of these halls are illuminated by an unknown light source, as if under the permanent effect of daylight.

### C60. Secret Entrance

The door leading to Room C61 is actually a secret stone panel that is very difficult to notice (DC 30 Wisdom (Perception) check). The secret panel upon the eastern wall is a 10-ft.-by-10-ft. section of stone that sinks into the floor when opened. The secret door opens instantly if a PC with the Mark of the Righteous (see Room C21 and C103) walks within 5 ft. of it, revealing bright light on the other side. The panel remains open for 1 minute before rising back into place. A PC with the Mark of the Righteous caught on the other side of this doorway needs only to touch the secret wall panel to open it.

The corridor widens here but leads to a bare wall. There is no dust here, but the place is undisturbed, suggesting that no one has ventured into this hallway for years.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** If no one has the Mark of the Righteous, the PCs cannot gain access to this chamber, and thus they cannot reach the eastern rooms of this region. Most importantly, the special key in Room C103 is unavailable to them. If the PCs never met Zrino (Room C21), or if they refused the Mark of the Righteous, Zrino arrives, offering the Mark. If the PCs attacked the lantern archon, however, he is not here.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 4

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### C61. Golden Weapon Rack

The western wall of this chamber contains an empty weapon rack. The structure of this fixture is composed of four long bars that curve slightly. Each of these bars are made of pure gold, decorated with a feather pattern. The golden feathers are linked to one another and form an intricate design. Upon the northern door, written in golden Celestial runes are the words: "Leave all weapons behind."

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room was designed so that anyone entering Room C62 would do so unharmed. The weapon rack is enchanted and all those leaving their arms behind find the journey through Rooms C67 and beyond more pleasant than it has been. The rack is also the key to unlock the door leading to Room C62. Once a weapon is placed, it cannot be removed from the rack, but an exact duplicate awaits in Room C67. If the PC returns to this room, the weapon is gone (unless the weapon was placed again in Room C67).

A PC with the Mark of the Righteous (see Room C21 and C103) walking within 5 ft. of the doorway is instantly aware of its existence. They also know how to open it, by simply touching the hidden panel. Only those with the Mark of the Righteous can open it in this fashion, however. When opened, the stone panel sinks to the floor.

The secret panel upon the eastern wall of this chamber is 5-ft.-by-5-ft. It is made from the same white stone as the walls of the room from this side, but, on the other side, the surface is as ordinary as that of the dark corridor leading to Room C95. Like the secret doorway in Room C60, this panel sinks into the floor when opened. The panel remains sunk inside the floor for 1 full minute before rising back into place. PCs without the Mark of the Righteous cannot open this door.

The door upon the north wall is locked. There are no obvious locking mechanisms, and it cannot be unlocked with normal means. The only way to unlock this door, and gain access to Room C62, is by placing weapons into the golden rack upon the western wall. A minimum of 1 weapon per PC must be placed in the rack. Once this is done, the weapons disappear and the door opens by itself, allowing the PCs access to Room C62.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 4

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The weapons rack is made of gold and is of significant value (2,000 gp or more). It is, however, bolted to the wall and magically maintained. PCs may pull the rack out from the wall with a successful DC 25 Strength check. Doing so not only cancels its enchantment, but also ruins the item, which crumbles into a fine black dust. Destroying the rack before unlocking the door prevents access to Room C62 permanently.

**Scaling:** N/A

### C62. Antechamber of Law

This square room is empty, but upon the perfectly smooth white stone floor is an intricate carving of an angel with outspread wings. The angelic figure sculpted into the floor holds a wide shield with a scale and sword design in its center.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** A successful DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) or DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the symbol on the shield represents Order. This symbol is used by angels and archons, as well as many religious orders that uphold the law.

This room contains a powerful device that affects all non-lawful beings. Any non-lawful creatures entering this room must make a DC 23 Wisdom save or be poisoned for 4d6 minutes. Lawful-aligned characters are not affected by this and unarmed non-lawful characters who placed all their weapons in the rack in Room C61 or Room C67 gain advantage on their save.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 6, Positive Energy, Safe

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the magical device's saving throw by +3. To decrease the challenge, reduce the save DC by -5.

### C63. The Hall of Law

Silken sheets are piled up all along the floor of this large hall. There are eight silk blankets on either side of the room, placed near the eastern and western wall. Though there are no beds under them, the blankets look rather inviting. Their deep blue shades dramatically contrast the clean white walls of the Hall.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room was a meditation hall. The silken sheets are surprisingly comfortable and lying on them feels like lying on a soft feathery mattress. Anyone stealing a blanket receives a deadly electrical blast upon exiting through either door. The discharge deals 12d6 points of lightning damage, but a DC 22 Constitution save reduces it by half.

Lawful PCs resting here will rejuvenate lost hit points at a rate of 5 per hour. In addition, resting for 8 hours also recuperates 1d3+1 lost points of one ability score damage they suffered. Upon awakening, they are under the effects of bless for 24 hours. Non-lawful PCs do not benefit from these effects.

Chaotic PCs find no respite here. No matter how long they sleep, they gain none of the benefits normally bestowed by rest. Furthermore, upon entering this room, chaotic-aligned PCs must make a DC 22 Wisdom save or immediately gain a level of exhaustion. Chaotic PCs who left all their weapons in the rack in Room C61 or C67 gain advantage on the save.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 8, Positive Energy, Safe

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have all chaotic creatures entering this room instantly gain a level of exhaustion and raise the damage caused by the electrical discharge to 16d6. To decrease the challenge, allow non-lawful PCs to rest normally in this room and reduce the damage caused by the discharge to 8d6.

### C64. An Account of the Last Battle

Gouges scar the pure white walls of this hall. The markings are letters of exquisite quality carved into the stone. The writing is in Celestial, but under each phrase are Common runes translating the language.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Arum used this room to record the account of the brave, final stand of the Paladins of Merunda. The account was made by Arum, who used both languages to make sure any good soul traveling into this chamber would know the truth. PCs succeeding at a DC 22 Wisdom (Insight) check, can sense sadness in the words and the style of writing, as if the writer had given up hope.

PCs reading the inscriptions on the walls learn that Merunda (a minor goddess of the ocean, travel, and vigilance) summoned the last of her followers to this dungeon. At first they did not know why the deity had called them to the forgotten place, but the servants of the goddess eventually learned they were expected to fight the great demon held within the confines of a special prison cell. They were also expected to die in their efforts. That is, all except Arum, whose signature can be found at the end of the account.

Moments before the tragic event, the paladins of Merunda were told the demon would escape its prison and that a mighty angel would slay the fiend, provided they sacrificed their lives to help it. When the time came, and the demon broke through the wall of its prison cell, the servants of Merunda stood ready to face the creature. They sacrificed their lives to allow the angel to kill the demon. Only Arum survived the onslaught, and the wizard saw the angel dissolve into thin air once the demon was dead.

Though the narrator does not explain the events leading to the demon's escape, he does insist that without the efforts of the followers of Merunda, this evil would not have been destroyed. And he notes that he wrote the account upon the walls to honor the memory, valor, and sacrifice of the deceased.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 12, Positive Energy, Safe

### C65. The Hall of Goodness

Large sofas of deep blue velvet dominate the eastern and western walls of this large hall. In the center is a low blue marble table. The furniture is elegant and, like the white stone surfaces of the hall, surprisingly clean.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Good-aligned PCs entering this hall immediately feel relaxed. Those suffering from ailments such as poison, disease, or a curse also feel that they could get better if they stay here a while longer. Every hour a good-aligned PC remains, they are cured of one of the following effects: poison, disease, blindness, deafness, curse, or paralysis. Non-good PCs do not gain any of these benefits.

For evil characters: this place is beyond unnerving, if not hostile. Upon entering the hall, they must succeed at a DC 30 Wisdom save or become blind and deaf. They also reduce their maximum HP by 4d8 for as long as they remain here. Removing blindness/deafness restores their sight and hearing. PCs who placed all their weapons in the rack in Room C61 or Room C67 gain advantage on the save.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 8, Positive Energy, Safe

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a bestow curse effect to each evil PC traveling in this hall. To decrease the challenge, have evil PCs either blind or deaf, not both, and reduce the save DC by 5.

### C66. Antechamber of Goodness

An intricate pattern is carved into the center of this room. The design represents a handsome male angel with powerful wings protruding from its back. The angel upon the floor has one hand above his head, partly outstretched in front of him. His other hand holds a delicate lyre at his side.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Religion) or DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the pose of the angel signifies peace. Angels, archons, and members of religious institutions frequently depict their greatest heroes in this position.

This room is imbued with strong magic that affects all non-good creatures. Non-good PCs entering this room must make a DC 22 Wisdom save or become frightened for 4d6 minutes and have their maximum hit points reduced by 3d6 until the end of their next Long Rest. Good characters are not affected and non-good characters who placed all their weapons in the rack in Room C61 or Room C67 gain advantage on the save.

**Encounter Condition:** Fear 22, Hallowed 6, Positive Energy, Safe

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the saving throw DC by +3 and the hit point damage by 2d6. To decrease the challenge, reduce the save DC by -5 and the hit point damage to 1d6.

### C67. Silvery Weapon Rack

The southern door is locked, but has no locking mechanism upon it. It cannot be unlocked through normal means and the only way to open it is by placing weapons onto the silvery shelves. Each PC must place at least one weapon in the rack. Like Room C61, these weapons cannot be removed.

An empty silver weapon rack is placed upon the western wall of this otherwise empty room. The rack is made from seven curved bars embellished with leafy patterns of wonderful design. The words, "Leave all weapons behind" are written in silver Celestial runes in the center of the southern door.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Like Room C61, this chamber was designed to allow everyone entering Rooms C62-C66 to leave their weapons behind. The weapon rack, although fashioned from a different material, functions as the one in Room C61. It is also the key to unlock the door leading to Room C66.

PCs who left their weapons behind in Room C61, and vice versa, find their weapons here. When non-evil PCs take their arms from the rack in Room C67, they feel the weapons are charged with potent energy. The weapons of lawful good PCs become +2 weapons. The duration of these enchantments lasts for 1 day plus a number of days equal to the character's Wisdom bonus (if any). Weapons may not be enhanced more than once per month, so PCs journeying through this section several times within a short period may not benefit from this more than once, unless they place different weapons in the rack.

The magical rack does not enhance the weapons of non-lawful or non-good PCs. The weapons of evil PCs are imbued with powerful enchantments that bestow them a -2 penalty for 1d4+1 days. An evil weapon placed in the rack is destroyed and never reappears.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 4

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The weapon rack in this room is made of the purest silver (it is worth approximately 2,000 gp). PCs can pull the rack from the wall with a successful DC 22 Strength check. Doing so, however, cancels its magical effect and ruins the item, which instantly crumbles into a fine black dust. Destroying the rack before unlocking the southern door also prevents access to Room C66.

**Scaling:** N/A

### C68. Secret Doorway

The secret stone panel sinks into the floor, revealing a brightly lit hallway leading south. The spotlessly clean corridor is narrow and illuminated by an unnatural, unseen source. It leads to a simple door.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** A hidden panel opens into the narrow corridor leading south. It is impossible to notice, but those with the Mark of the Righteous automatically learn of its existence. The secret door is a 5-ft.-by-5-ft. panel that sinks into the floor when opened. It opens automatically if a PC with the Mark of the Righteous (see Room C21 and C103) touches it and remains open for 1 minute before rising back into place.

If no one has the Mark of the Righteous, the PCs cannot gain access to this room. If the PCs never encountered Zrino (Room C21), or if they met the lantern archon but refused the Mark of the Righteous, Zrino appears her now to offer the Mark, unless the PCs attacked him before.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

## C69-C79. Black Dragon Territory

Before Arum fled the dungeon, his scattered mind created several monstrosities in this section, bringing to life inanimate objects (like the furniture) and turning mindless mold into powerful, destructive oozes. Months and years passed as Arum hid under the shadow of the dragon, before fleeing the region in search of clarity and to ease his worried mind.

Over the years this section became home to a number of creatures, including hill giants (too stupid to stay away), and a number of gnoll patrols who eventually learned to leave well enough alone. Now, uncontested, a mighty black dragon named Nardarik controls Rooms C69-C79. This cunning dragon is aware of every secret door and hidden passage in his territory. Nardarik is smart and agile, and frequently patrols his lair to ensure no other inhabitants enter it. While journeying through Nardarik's territory, the PCs notice several scuff marks upon the floor and walls. Nardarik's claws and scaly body created these marks. They are especially obvious in narrow corridors and chambers.

When Nardarik encounters the PCs, he is hostile. Unless they offer great treasures, the dragon attacks. He wants nothing to do with the PCs. However, if they buy their way out, Nardarik will honor the bargain and show them to the exit.

### C69. First Marked Room

The surface of the stone floor and walls here is heavily pitted and scarred. A closer examination suggests that part of the rock face was burned. There are also several marks upon the floor, suggesting frequent traffic.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The walls and floor of this room are damaged. Their stone surfaces are melted and uneven, as though a potent acid had eaten through the rock. Nardarik (Room C77), the black dragon that makes his lair in this area, is responsible for the markings.

There is nothing special in this room aside from the acid-damaged floor and walls. A successful DC 12 Intelligence check made here confirms the walls and floor were damaged with a strong acid. Another check (DC 15) suggests the acid was thrown or projected against the stone surfaces, as though through a jet or thrown flask. A third check (DC 18) reveals the acid's source was monstrous and unnatural.

A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check uncovers a simple secret panel at the end of the western corridor. This panel is made from the same stone as the walls and is just as damaged. It tilts precariously upon hidden hinges towards the inside of this room when opened. A narrow groove into the stone surface allows PCs to pull it open, but a successful DC 15 Strength check is required.

**Encounter Condition:** Fog 10 or Smoke

**Tactics:** After the PCs spend 30 minutes in this room, roll for a random encounter.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### C70. Devastated Chamber

The three secret doors leading into this room are simple stone panels that can be noticed with DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) checks. When pushed with a successful DC 15 Strength check, they swing open, revealing strong iron hinges hidden within the archway. PCs opening the panels from the outside must use a narrow groove that grips the panel (also requiring a Strength check).

The two secret doors in the corridor to the northwest are identical to those from this room.

This room is filled with broken furniture, crushed boulders, and bone fragments. The debris is piled at the foot of the western wall, and a simple looking door separates them in two mounds. Within the debris are bits of rusty iron, thorns, and rotted clothing.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** When Nardarik took control of the section, he fought powerful hill giant stragglers. The dragon wasted no time hunting down his enemies, and the giants made a brave, but futile last stand. Casting the room in darkness, Nardarik killed each giant, slowly, in turn. Now, only their bony carcasses remain, along with the devastation wrought by Nardarik.

Searching the debris thoroughly takes 2 hours, but PCs succeeding at a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check can determine that the bone fragments from the detritus resulted from the decay of a number of giant-sized creatures. Portions of these bones are pitted, twisted, or melted, as though acid had been thrown upon them. PCs studying the bones must succeed at a DC 16 Intelligence (Nature) check to ascertain they come from seven different hill giants.

A DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check made here also reveals that behind the debris, portions of the western wall are scarred and damaged, as though by acid.

**Encounter Condition:** Deep Darkness, Echoes 4, Fog

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** There is nothing of value in this hall, as Nardarik stripped the giants of any treasure they carried, including their weapons. PCs taking at least 20 minutes to search this room uncover large pieces of wood, broken iron nails, the dried remains of pine branches, and large-but-rotted animal pelts. These broken and useless materials framed at least ten very wide bunk beds.

**Scaling:** N/A

### C71. Second Marked Room

The westernmost secret door is discovered with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The panel is simple and made from the same damaged stone as the walls. A narrow groove allows the PCs to grip the panel and pull it open. This action requires a DC 15 Strength check.

The floor and walls of this chamber are heavily damaged. The stone surfaces are uneven and marked with unfamiliar patterns.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Like Room C69, a strong acid heavily damaged the walls and floor of this chamber. These cryptic marks are a warning to trespassers. A successful DC 12 Intelligence check confirms the substance used to burn and melt the stone was acid.

**Encounter Condition:** Fog 10, Stagnant Air

### C72. Hall of Rubble

A massive pile of stone rubble dominates this great hall. Boulders and chunks of broken rocks, all neatly put together in the center of the area, form a mound almost as tall as the 50-ft high ceiling.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Though the PCs can step into this room, it is extremely difficult to move inside it, due to the stone rubble scattered everywhere. PCs staying close to the walls can make their way around the hall, circling the mound, the summit of which is roughly in the center of the room. Once rubble has fallen, the PCs may move safely.

**Encounter Condition:** Fog 10, Hazardous Footing 16, Tremors 19

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** If the PCs spend 2 hours searching through the rubble, they find several bone fragments (scarred by acid), a small pile of copper slag, and a bag of holding (although the sack looks like any other, only undamaged). It does not radiate magic.

After 3 hours, allow the PCs a DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check to discover a dragon slayer dagger (magical +1 dagger, deals an additional 3d6 damage against dragons). Nardarik could not destroy it, so he buried it under a massive pile of rubble.

**Scaling:** N/A

### C73. Trapped Hallway

The secret door on the northern end of the corridor is easy to spot. The grooves surrounding the stone panel are larger than most and there are obvious markings (wide scuffs) on the floor around it that disappear under the secret panel. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check is enough to spot these, and a subsequent DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to uncover the hidden button to the east of the panel. Pushing this button causes the panel to slide through the western wall, disappearing completely.

The westernmost part of the south wall of this 60-ft.-high corridor is significantly damaged. The stone is broken and several piles of rubble lay scattered upon the floor, as though some powerful force had struck the wall. On the far end of the hallway, a single wooden lever juts from the stone.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** At the end of the hallway is a lever (that does nothing). It is designed to get someone to walk down the hallway. Two rounds after the secret door is opened, a potent magical trap is triggered. The magic affects the entire length of the corridor, from either side of the secret panel. PCs succeeding at a DC 19 Wisdom (Perception) check can find a tiny locking mechanism beside the secret doorway. This lock can be picked with a DC 21 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to safely bypass the trap.

When triggered, the trap remains active for 7 rounds. On the first round, the reverse gravity sends all creatures and objects hurling toward the ceiling. Creatures take 6d6 falling damage when they hit the 60-ft.-high ceiling. When the spell ends, 7 rounds later, they fall to the ground as the reverse gravity effect ends, taking damage again. A DC 16 Dexterity save for each fall reduces the damage to half.

**Reverse Gravity Trap**
- **Detect:** DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)
- **Disable:** DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)
- **Effect:** DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 falling damage.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the ceiling height to 100 ft. (10d6 fall damage). To decrease the challenge, reduce the ceiling height to 40 ft. and have the trap trigger 3 rounds later.

### C74. Mimic's Chamber

This wide hall is vacant except for massive wooden shelves dominating the entire northern wall. The shelves are filled with vials, leather bound books, yellowed scrolls, clay pots, and silvery urns.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** A mimic, fearful of Nardarik, remains in the form of a large bookshelf filled with trinkets to attract anyone foolish enough to enter. It lies in wait, ready to attack intruders. Having suffered years of torment at Nardarik's hand, it is eager to vent its rage upon those who violate its lair. It attacks the PCs when someone steps within 5 ft. of it.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush, Fearless, Poor Footing 4

**Tactics:** The mimic exudes a thick adhesive, hoping to grapple its prey or catch their weapons. Though angry, this creature fights intelligently and when given the chance, it concentrates its attacks upon less-armored opponents.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one mimic. To decrease the challenge, give the PCs an opportunity to spot the mimic.

### C75. False Dragon's Hoard

This cross-shaped hall is filled with coins of all shapes and sizes. Upon the mounds of copper, gold, and silver are crystal candelabras, golden plates, silver cutlery, ivory cups, and multiple brightly colored jewels.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Nardarik is a covetous creature, with no understanding of his true lineage. His reptilian mind understands two things: "this is mine" and "how do I get more?" Therefore, to protect his valuables from gnolls, giants, and whatever beasts are too stupid to stay away, he built a false treasure hoard.

The entire room is blanketed with a permanent illusional image (DC 20 Intelligence save) making visitors believe the room holds incredible treasures. PCs rolling a natural '1' on their saves see whatever they most desire in the hoard (weapons, power, etc.). In reality, the illusion hides a pit trap covering most of the floor. Only those who see through the illusion can search for the trap (otherwise all search checks automatically fail). Anyone stepping on the floor triggers the mechanism, which opens a pit trap 2 rounds later.

**Wide-Mouth Pit Trap**
- **Detect:** DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
- **Disable:** DC 17 Dexterity
- **Effect:** Characters in the room DC 15 Dexterity save or fall 100 ft. and take 10d6 bludgeoning damage each.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** There is nothing of value here, as the treasure is just an illusion.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the depth of the wide-mouth pit trap to 150 ft. To decrease the challenge, reduce the depth to 60 ft.
