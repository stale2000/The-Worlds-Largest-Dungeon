# Region A: Rooms A1-A17

## Introduction

> **STOP!** If you still need to read the introduction, do so now. You must understand the foundation of the dungeon to run this adventure. Details on lighting, doors, and so on all explain how to run this adventure.

## Longtail's Story

Longtail is a wererat sorcerer with a quick mind, charisma, and grand ambitions. With research and the aid of his imp familiar Achsyyx, Longtail uncovered some of the secrets of the dungeons, its history, and their original purpose.

Through Achsyyx's ability to commune with the infernal powers, he learned that there was a long-forgotten chapel close to the dungeon entrance that held a gateway to an extradimensional space where multitudes of infernal beasts had been trapped. According to Achsyyx, releasing those beasts would make the wererat their master and grant him a ferocious army. Longtail's destiny was clear.

Longtail's endless charm allowed him to bring together a diverse force of humanoids to accompany him on his quest. Gathered from the disaffected elements of half a dozen tribes; kobolds, troglodytes, orcs, and even an ogre rallied to his side.

Fueled by the promise of treasure and led by lizardfolk guides, Longtail's forces made their way to the dungeon in short order. Entering the long-lost entrance, they began exploring the area searching for the tomb's fabled wealth. Longtail himself, guided by Achsyyx, led a small expedition into the farthest reaches.

At first, empty-handed, the humanoids were eager to exploit their new home, greeting Longtail's absence as a chance to gather as much treasure as possible. But as party after party came back empty-handed and with tales of barren rooms filled with nothing but traps, trouble ensued.

Longtail's natural leadership had held the unusual force together. Soon, however, natural rivalries began to assert themselves. Insults and slights led to shouting and infighting, and suspicions and rumors of unshared loot led to bitter accusations. Inevitably, an armed confrontation took place, and Longtail's force was splintered in two. The reptilians, composed of the kobolds, troglodytes, and lizardfolk, banded together against the more numerous orcs and their ogre enforcer.

The dungeon was divided, each side looking for treasure they would never find. After fruitless days, both sides became convinced that the other side had found something. Soon, spying gave way to battle as the two factions fought across the length and breadth of the area. In a short time, they forgot about treasure, concerned only with wiping out their enemies.

Whatever magic once existed in the prison-dungeon to keep hostilities squashed had evaporated. The dungeon was now fomenting with dissent and hate. Something Achsyyx either didn't understand or didn't plan for. And now, Longtail's quest was a side note in the scuffle; some even forgot about the half-fiend.

They would soon be reminded.

Even as the humanoids fought amongst themselves, Longtail led his expedition to the forgotten chapel. There, with the aid of his familiar Achsyyx, he opened the gateway. 

Things did not go as planned. A wave of extraplanar beasts, driven by hatred, rushed through the gateway and into the dungeon. Falling on the fighting humanoids, the beasts struck a hammer blow that filled the dungeon with the blood and the screams of Longtail's erstwhile allies. As Longtail tried desperately to gain control, Achsyyx and the infernal powers smiled.

## Random Encounters

The release of the extraplanar beasts has thrown this entire Region into chaos. Whereas before, there were clear areas under the influence of a particular group of humanoids, the resulting chaos means that there are no longer any actual areas of control. Between the hunting beasts and the scared, lost humanoids, there is plenty of motion and confusion in this dungeon. As a result, a party traveling through this Region is just as likely to encounter a reptilian as they are an orc or an extraplanar beast.

Rather than checking at some specific time interval for random encounters, the GM should use this table whenever they deem appropriate. Remember that despite the number of Rooms in this Region, there is not a lot of distance between most Rooms and areas and sound carries well in such an environment. If the action is slow — for instance, the PCs are taking their time searching through the rubble in a Room or are being extra cautious as they move down a hall — the events from this table will liven things up.

Another way to use the chart is to add a random element to the encounters described in the various Rooms. Many of the listed random encounters add an interesting twist to the otherwise standard combat scenarios inevitable in a dungeon of this size. After all, the noise of combat is bound to attract some interest.

A final option for this table is if the PCs return to areas or Rooms where they have already been. Since the dungeon is in constant flux, it is likely that something other than the original inhabitants now occupy the Room. A particularly bold GM could use this table to add the occasional encounter to an otherwise empty Room.

### When to Roll Random Encounters

- Whenever the PCs spend too much time in one place
- Whenever the PCs do something noisy
- Whenever the PCs rest with any sort of food or fire in a non-safe room

### Random Encounters Table

| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | A loud, guttural scream echoes in the distance. When rolled again, the sound becomes more guttural. Include the sounds of blood and phlegm if you like. |
| 2 | A dead kobold or orc lies in the hallway, recently murdered. When rolled again, a pair of bodies are discovered and, this time, mutilated in addition to murder. |
| 3-8 | Nothing. When rolled again, add +1 to the roll. This bonus is cumulative. |
| 9 | Two fiendish snake swarms slither the dungeon corridors in search of a meal. When rolled again, make the swarm carriers of disease. |
| 10 | Four fiendish stirges, tired of the offal in this dungeon, seek the blood of something warm. When rolled again, there are three additional stirges, now carrying a contagious disease. |
| 11 | A fiendish rat swarm charges toward the PCs, fleeing from something in the darkness. They spend one round moving past the PCs, dealing damage as they go. When rolled again, the swarm deals double damage. |
| 12 | A pack of six fiendish dire rats digs its way out of a crack in the wall and proceeds to stalk the PCs. When rolled again, there are five additional rats, and then they gain a +5 circumstance bonus to ambush. |
| 13 | A patrol of eight kobold warriors or four orc warriors meanders, looking for a place to rest in the hopes of avoiding work. They only fight the PCs if no other option is available. When rolled again, the patrol size doubles and is more likely to engage. |
| 14 | Four lost/confused troglodytes shout at one another, arguing about directions and the futility of this endeavor. GMs are encouraged to develop this argument further. When rolled again, this encounter becomes three orcs beating up a pair of troglodytes. |
| 15 | A krenshar and its kobold rider scout the halls, returning to Room A69 with news of intruders. When rolled again, the krenshar has four kobold infantry escorts. |
| 16 | A combination of 1d6 various mephits, wearing the skin of darkmantles pry their little fingers into the stone walls, to no avail. When rolled again, increase the number of mephits to 2d4+1. |
| 17 | **Minor tremor.** Dust falls from the ceiling, obscuring vision throughout the entire Region. All sight, including darkvision, is limited to 5 ft. Creatures within 5 ft. are lightly obscured, while creatures farther away are heavily obscured. Dust remains for 1 round. When rolled again, the dust remains for 1d3+1 rounds. |
| 18 | **Tremor.** As minor tremor, except creatures in the entire Region must succeed at a DC 10 Dexterity save or fall prone. Dust remains for 1d4+1 rounds. When rolled again, the dust remains for 1d6+2 rounds. |
| 19 | **Major tremor.** As tremor, except creatures in the entire Region must succeed at a DC 12 Dexterity save or fall prone. All creatures suffer 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage from the rocks. Dust remains for 2d4+2 rounds. When rolled again, increase all numeric values by 2. |
| 20 | Roll twice on this table, ignoring any further rolls of 19+. |

## Plot Hooks

The Introduction presents a number of ways to get a party started in the World's Largest Dungeon. A more specific example is suggested here, detailing the ambitions of Longtail and the imp Achsyyx. Although the exact reasons for the PCs' travel to the dungeon are up to the GM, Longtail's plans feed directly into the plot of this region.

If you include this canon, Longtail has stolen a book of rituals from a nearby church.

In its simplest form, this means the PCs could be retained by said church to stop Longtail's plans. This is also a handy way to ensure that the PCs are adequately equipped before entering the dungeon, with the third party providing essential aid, such as perhaps an ongoing source of magical lighting or two.

An alternative idea is the PCs have had a run-in with Longtail or his humanoid allies before entering the World's Largest Dungeon. This would require the GM to author up his pre-pre-adventure. Nothing complicated. Just a short series of investigations that keep Longtail always one step ahead.

Regardless, once the PCs arrive at the dungeon, they find themselves in the middle of the action.

The PCs don't need to be aware of any plots to enter the dungeon, either. If they are treasure-seekers searching for a long-lost magic item, this might be enough motivation to enter. In this case, the PCs just happen to be unfortunate enough to enter the dungeon shortly after the release of the extraplanar beasts.

## Room Descriptions

### Room A1: Entrance

**Features:** Opaque magical barrier preventing exit, absolute darkness and silence beyond

This is the last chance the PCs have to rest and reflect before entering the dungeon. Nothing else enters it as long as the PCs are in the entrance chamber. An inspection of the passageway as it approaches the 'barrier' reveals that it is absolutely featureless, devoid of markings, symbols, or even any sign of use.

As you move through the passageway, the edge of the tunnel disappears into a blackness that lies just beyond. It is not a wall barring entry but an indescribable void. Darkness and light meet in a perfect duality. Peering cautiously into the darkness for signs of movement, you see none. There is a stillness in the air. No breeze in front of you. Nothing. Your ears detect only the breathing of your fellow adventurers. The darkness betrays nothing of what lies beyond.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The passageway ends in an opaque magical field. This field prevents all vision, including darkvision, as well as all sound from passing through from one side to the other in either direction. In addition, the magical field has an unusual and permanent force effect that allows creatures and items to enter the dungeon without difficulty but absolutely prevents them from leaving.

**Opaque Door Barrier:** Permanent, one-way wall of force. Cannot be dispelled or disintegrated, and no sound can pass through it.

If the PCs want to enter the dungeon, they simply must take that leap of faith and step beyond the door. Cautious PCs may stick only a hand or an object through, but they find that when they try to withdraw the hand or object, they cannot because the barrier prevents the return movement. No amount of pulling brings the hand or object back through the barrier, although if enough force is used, the object could undoubtedly be broken or the hand severed.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe

**Tactics:** Subtly encourage the PCs to prepare themselves by healing, resting, and readying equipment and weapons, etc., prior to having them enter the dungeon if they need it. Nothing bothers them as long as they are in this Room, and they can take all the time they need to make sure they are in tip-top shape.

**Treasure:** None

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, do not indicate a barrier has been passed. Simply let the PCs walk through an invisible force field unknowingly. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, give the PCs a hint that this barrier is one-way, or simply ignore this effect completely. Allow the PCs to come and go as they please. This eliminates a lot of the dread of the dungeon but does give back one more gaming option to players who demand complete agency.

## The Orc Stronghold (Rooms A2-A20)

Rooms A2 through A20 make up the former orc stronghold within this Region. The orcs chose the area closest to the entrance for defensive reasons and launched all of their search expeditions from here. While this portion of the dungeon is defensively strong, these same qualities limit the ability of the orcs to explore the other parts of the dungeon.

As the conflict with the reptilians escalated, the orcs' leader, a barbarian named Orghar, decided that it was time to force a decision. Marshaling the orcs, he led them in an all-or-nothing assault on the reptilians throughout the dungeon.

Since launching the attack, the orcs have abandoned this section. Although they planned to return and establish a garrison to guard the entrance once they were victorious, none returned. Various groups established themselves throughout the Region but have been displaced since.

---

### Room A2: The First Room

**Features:** Two iron doors, chill and damp atmosphere, three exhausted orc warriors

Your torchlight gleams feebly in the complete gloom, lighting up a small section of the room. Barely glinting in the torchlight, two iron doors, one straight ahead of you and the other to the side, are the only things visible in the walls of worked stone. The chill and damp clings to your body. You are not the only one feeling it, judging by the coughs coming from the darkness.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** Three orc warriors sit huddled together in the northeastern corner of this Room. They are battered remnants of the orcs who followed Longtail into the dungeon. There could be others. Somewhere. They look exhausted, and their scar-marked faces are ashen and pale. Infected wounds are evident, as well as bruises and blood stains from weeks of fighting. One has an eye full of pus. Another is missing teeth and spits blood into a rusted cup. One orc attempts to stifle a lingering, persistent cough.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The orcs are fatigued from their recent experiences. Each orc suffers from one level of exhaustion. They are not looking for a fight and will only attack if the PCs attack them first. The PCs are free to move about the Room — the orcs only watch listlessly. Even if elves or dwarves are with the party, the orcs do no more than half-heartedly bare their teeth in an empty threat.

Any PC succeeding at a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check realizes the orcs have simply given up and are waiting for the inevitable. If the PCs ask the orcs about what happened to them, the largest of the three appears to ponder the question for a moment and then says "You will see soon enough" in broken Common. The other two laugh at the response, the smallest one stifling his cough. The orcs ignore any further questions, answering with half-hearted, surly glances.

Any acts of intimidation, bluffing, or diplomacy fail on these tired warriors, and no amount of promises, threats, or bribes gets them to care about anyone or anything. No matter what, the orcs do not accompany or aid the PCs in any way. They make their final stand in this Room.

If a fight ensues, the orcs do what they can to defend themselves, but their fatigue and defeatist attitude work against them at this point. They employ no tactics other than a straightforward attack.

If the PCs return to this Room later (at least an hour or so has passed), the three orcs are dead, killed by fiendish darkmantles.

**Treasure:** None

**Creatures:** Three orc warriors (each with one level of exhaustion)

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two more orcs. To decrease the challenge, have the orcs be exhausted (move at half speed, -6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity).

---

### Room A3: Body Storage

**Features:** Overwhelming stench, 23 corpses (17 kobolds, 6 troglodytes), makeshift shelf with body parts

Even before the door opens, you smell something amiss. As it swings open, the stench from within is overwhelming. The source is more than a score of bodies in a pile, their flesh rotting away. Some chunks hang on hooks, while a barrel filled with harvested organs stews in the center of the room. On the northern wall, a makeshift shelf, warped by too much blood and sagging from the weight of severed arms and legs, is about to collapse.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** These bodies are trophies brought back by the orcs from their conflicts with the reptilians. There are 23 bodies here, 17 kobolds, and six troglodytes in varying states of decay. All of them have been stripped of anything they carried in life. Examination of the bodies shows their wounds were caused by sharp-edged weapons.

If the PCs move around the room, they most certainly kick over a jar of preserved eyes that lies in the darkness. However it is possible to spot it with a Wisdom check (DC 16) before that happens. Whoever left this has a sick sense of trophy-hunting.

The smell of decay is strong enough to require a DC 12 Constitution saving throw from every living creature that enters the Room. Failing the save causes the creature to be poisoned for the duration of their stay in the Room as well as for 1d4 rounds thereafter. Any living creature spending more than a single round in the Room is also subject to catching an airborne variant of filth fever.

**Filth Fever:** DC 11 Constitution save. On a failure: in 1d3 days, Dexterity and Constitution are each reduced by 1d4 until the disease is removed. Repeat save every 8 hours. Filth Fever ends after three consecutive successful DC 11 Constitution saves.

The secret door in the eastern wall is a standard secret door (Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15) that pivots on a vertical center hinge. The space opened by the door is just wide enough for a creature of medium size or smaller to pass on either side of the door (so up to two medium-size creatures can pass through simultaneously).

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** A kobold liver is mashed and cut up at the bottom of the barrel. Inside the liver, someone has stored a silver ring. The ring is somehow clean, and blood will not cling to it. It's very large and won't fit a normal-sized human finger, however.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

### Room A4: Antechamber

**Features:** Burning hands trap on southern door, moldy sacks in corners, secret doors east and west

Several piles of moldy sacks sit in each of the four corners of this room, and their decaying contents fill the air with a sour smell. There is a door directly across from the one you just opened.

The southern door to this Room is trapped with burning hands. Anytime a Tiny or larger creature touches the face of the door, the trap is triggered, shooting flames in a 15-ft. cone from the center of the door.

**Burning Hands Trap:** 3d6 fire damage. Creatures take half damage on a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. Automatically resets after 1 round.

The secret doors in the eastern and western walls are standard secret doors.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The orc warriors in Room A2 are aware of the trap but avoid it. If the trap injures or kills any of the PCs while the orcs are in that Room, the orcs break out into grins and chuckle amongst themselves, claiming ignorance if confronted.

Inside one of the sacks is a troglodyte head, now covered in mold and devoid of flesh. The eyes have since rotted away or been eaten by bugs. If the PCs have not encountered a troglodyte before, the skull is a foreign shape to them. Conversely, allow a DC 15 Wisdom (Nature) check to identify it.

The contents of the other sacks have long since rotted. They defy identification. Small gray mushrooms and black molds grow on top of the piles. See treasure below.

Any PC that disturbs a sack roughly causes the mold to burst, releasing its mildly poisonous spores. Picking up any sack breaks the bottom, spilling the contents on the floor. This also releases spores (obviously). Eating the mold produces similar results.

**Black Mold:** If disturbed, a patch of this mold bursts forth with a cloud of poisonous spores. All living creatures within 10 ft. of the mold must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save or suffer 1d4 points of Constitution damage for 24 hours. The only ways to destroy the mold is with fire or to let it dry out in a warm, dry climate for 24 hours.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Since the PCs have survived a trap, they most certainly have to pass back through again, roll up a random magic item relevant to their level and class composition, and hide it amongst the moldy sacks.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the damage of the burning hands trap to 6d6 and replace the black mold with yellow mold (see Room A84). To decrease the challenge, reduce the initial/secondary damage of the black mold to 1 point of temporary Constitution damage each.

---

### Room A5: Main Storage

**Features:** Rotting barrels and crates, black mold, fresh blood starfish-shaped marks on wall

The doors to Rooms A4 and A6 are open.

Rotting barrels, moldy crates, and disintegrating sacks with mushrooms embedded in them line the left wall of this room, leaving a 5-ft. wide passageway along the right wall directly in front of the door. The smell of mold and mildew is strong. Black mold spiderwebs out from the barrels and up the walls. Bloody starfish-shaped marks on the wall seem fresh, as though something was just killed here. But that isn't possible. Right?

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Dozens of barrels, crates, and sacks line the wall, extending into the western end of the Room. They are piled up in a disorganized fashion (to say the least), and most of them have been opened (the barrels have their tops staved in, the crates' boards torn away, and the sacks ripped open, some of their contents spilling onto the ground).

As in Room A4, the sacks are covered in black mold and mushroom colonies. Although the barrels and crates are not so afflicted, the items are stacked so haphazardly that anyone moving a barrel or crate must succeed at a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or release a cloud of spores from one of the sacks nearby. Moving a sack causes it to disintegrate, spilling its contents on the floor and releasing the mold into the air.

If the PCs are bold enough to rifle through the contents anyway, they find that the barrels contain vinegar (still good), the crates contain various rusted mining tools (such as picks and shovels), and the contents of the sacks have been lost to the mold.

**Black Mold:** If disturbed, a patch of this mold bursts forth with a cloud of poisonous spores. All living creatures within 10 ft. of the mold must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save or suffer 1d4 points of Constitution damage for 24 hours. The only ways to destroy the mold is with fire or to let it dry out in a warm, dry climate for 24 hours.

The acid arrow trap in the hallway beyond Room A5 is described in Room A6.

The blood on the wall is from a fiendish darkmantle that consumed a fleeing orc. The body is long gone, but the blood refuses to dry up. Something about the kill remains fresh, though neither the killer nor the victim is still here. The PCs can collect this blood into a bottle or flask. The blood never congeals or diminishes in quality.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** A careful search of the Room (DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check) reveals a small gold ring (40 gp) and a simple chain (20 sp) resting between two barrels. Note that as long as the search does not entail actually moving anything, there is no chance of releasing the black mold.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of the encounter, replace the black mold with yellow mold (see Room A84). To decrease the challenge of the encounter, reduce the Constitution damage to 1 point or lower the save DC to 10.

---

### Room A6: Tool Storage

**Features:** Coils of rope, barrels of nails, tools on makeshift pegs, secret door west, acid arrow trap in northern hallway

Coils of rope, barrels with nails, and open crates with tools line the walls on makeshift pegs. Although the air is damp, there is no mold on any of the items.

Any Tiny or larger creature entering the north/south hallway leading to Room A6 triggers an acid arrow trap. The proximity trigger covers the space just before the northern door to Room A6. Any creature who remains for more than one minute in the hall resets the trap, allowing it to trigger again.

**Acid Arrow Trap:** A shimmering green arrow streaks towards the target. +4 to hit one target. On a hit, 4d4 acid damage immediately and another 2d4 at the end of the target's next turn. DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. Resets after 1 minute.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** There are five coils of hempen rope totaling 500 ft., as well as seven small barrels of rusty nails and enough tools to make a total of 10 sets of stonemason's tools (hammers, chisels, etc.). The hemp rope has been weakened by the damp air and breaks if subjected to holding more than 100 lbs of weight.

The secret door in the western wall is a standard secret door and is used to bypass the trap in the hall. The PCs can open it with a little bit of pressure (DC 10 Strength check) once the door is discovered.

Because of the acid arrow trap, this room is not safe to rest in. But should the PCs find a way to disable it, they can stay here for a while without disturbance. Regardless, there is no chance of a random encounter here.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** There is a 1 in 20 chance one of the tools is magical in nature, providing a +2 bonus to skill checks while using it.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a 3rd stage of damage to the acid arrow trap for another 2d4 acid damage. To decrease the challenge, reduce the Wisdom check DC by 5.

---

### Room A7: Former Troglodyte Quarters

**Features:** Dried grass scattered everywhere, troglodyte stench, bloody draconic writing, secret door north

The heavy smell of stale air greets you as you open the door to this large room. Dried grass is scattered all over the floor as though a tornado recently tore through a meadow. Something written in blood in a foreign language stands about 3 feet off the ground in the northeast corner.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This Room was occupied by a small group of troglodytes who treated it much like their former cave home; they were among the first of the orcs' victims when relations among the humanoids went sour. Given their uncivilized nature, they used it not only as their sleeping place but for everything else, although they kept those activities to the southeastern corner.

The troglodyte stench is eye-wateringly powerful, and any living creature that enters the Room must succeed at a DC 12 Constitution save or become poisoned for as long as it is in the Room and for 1d4 rounds after it leaves the Room.

The dried grass is composed of reed mat remnants the troglodytes used as sleeping mats, and were destroyed during a fight in this Room. A DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals dried pools of blood throughout.

The troglodytes were unaware of the secret door in the middle of the northern wall, as were the orcs. The locking mechanism for the door is quite simple, but the door is hard to spot. It can only be found with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check. Finding and pushing the latch does not require a roll once the door is found, however.

Troglodytes, who died fighting the orcs, were disposed of through various means, including leaving them for the rats to finish off, and using their bones as weapons.

The bloody letters are written in draconic. "Gristuun was here" is written in an extremely crude form.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Brave characters may search through the detritus. On a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check, they uncover one of the following: a necklace made of freshwater shells of various sizes on a leather thong (1 gp); a ceremonial bronze dagger (5 gp); or a ceramic idol of a creature that is a cross between a toad and a lizard (no value).

**Scaling:** N/A

---

### Room A8: Orc Corpse

**Features:** Debris-covered floor, fresh orc corpse with strange holes, broken spear, bracelet of preservation

The floor is covered in debris, and the walls are covered with decades of filth. The body of an orc, his arm outstretched toward the doorway, lies slumped near the middle of the room. The smell of decay is oddly absent, and the body has not started to rot. A lone spear, its shaft broken, lays in one of the corners. Giant holes in the body of the orc, but no blood, indicate a strange murder.

The door to Room A2 is closed. The door to Room A9 is open.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This orc was a clansman to the orcs in Room A2, who they abandoned. Attacked by fiendish darkmantles or stirges, he managed to drag himself here in a vain attempt to keep up with his clansmen. If the PCs alert the three orcs in Room A2 that they have found another orc, none of the trio responds.

A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check of the body reveals several holes in the corpse's neck, arm, and leg where the fiendish creatures successfully attached themselves to the orc. Each hole also has up to eight smaller, rough punctures near it where the pincers found purchase.

If the PCs move the body, a weird series of cracks and hollow noises escape the joints and bones. The orc's sandals are tattered, and the bottom of his feet are covered in sores and lesions.

Upon closer inspection, the orc wears a thin bracelet of elven origin. If it is removed, the PCs' nostrils are assaulted by the smell of death. The bracelet's magic keeps the body from rotting, and the process happens almost instantaneously as the body transforms in seconds.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Unless the PCs are exceptionally quiet and do not use a light source of any kind, the fiendish darkmantle in Room A9 is alerted to their presence through the open doorway.

By this point, the region should start to feel uneasy. For low-level characters, the problems staring them in the face are not typical. The orcs don't really want to fight, and the dead that are found show signs of a problem atypical to low-level adventures. If you're looking to prepare them for the rest of the campaign, ratchet up the creep factor as they explore deeper into the prison.

**Treasure:** A heavy burlap satchel attached to the corpse contains a few silver pieces, a pair of teeth (origin unknown), a piece of flint that is wrapped in wet cloth, a jeweler's hammer, 11 feet of rope, two iron spikes, and a bone saw.

The orc's bracelet smells of ocean air and clean sand. Whatever magic created it, it still works on a new body should a PC wear it. But it only halts and does not reverse the rotting process.

**Scaling:** N/A

### Room A9: Death From Above

**Features:** Empty room, permanent burn mark on eastern wall, fiendish darkmantle on ceiling

Both doors in this Room are open. The southern door has been wedged open with a sturdy piece of metal.

An open door on the opposite wall appears to be the only other way in or out of this otherwise empty room. The floor is suspiciously clean, except for a permanent burn mark on the eastern wall.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Clinging to the ceiling of this Room is a fiendish darkmantle. The darkmantle is hanging by its "foot" in the middle of the ceiling. It has lifted its tentacles up and flattened itself out, taking on the coloration of the stone as it waits for potential prey to move underneath it. A PC succeeding on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices an unusual lump on the ceiling.

Once the darkmantle drops, the noise of combat attracts a nearby fiendish rat (out scouting for its fiendish rat swarm) from Room A10. Given the darkness and commotion in Room A9, the fiendish rat's presence goes completely unnoticed unless a PC states they are specifically looking for additional danger, at which time a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the fiendish rodent.

As long as it is unobserved, the fiendish rat watches the combat to the end and then leaves to report the activity to its fellows in Room A11. If it is spotted, the fiendish rat immediately flees the scene to make its report.

**Encounter Condition:** Concealment, Echoes 5, Fearless

**Tactics:** This fiendish darkmantle has patiently waited for someone to enter the Room since killing the orc in Room A8. It attacks the moment a PC has fully entered the Room.

The fiendish darkmantle most likely gains surprise and uses this round to invoke its darkness before attacking on the next round. This is a common darkmantle tactic.

It attacks the first PC into the room, seeking to incapacitate them before moving on to the next nearest, dealing with each PC in turn. Unless the PC has spotted the fiendish darkmantle, he still will not know exactly what is happening or where an attack might be coming from.

This fiendish darkmantle fights to the death, even pursuing fleeing PCs.

**Note:** It is quite possible for PCs to die in this encounter. Consider letting the PCs take on the roles of nearby orcs, or if they are reduced to less than 0 hit points, make their first death save automatic.

**Treasure:** None

**Creatures:** One fiendish darkmantle, possibly one fiendish dire rat scout

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish darkmantle hide directly above the doorway, increasing the Perception check DC to 21. Consider having a second fiendish rat appear and attack the PCs while engaged. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish darkmantle fly into the Room as the PCs enter. Both sides are surprised.

### Room A10: The Watcher in the Doorway

**Features:** Empty room, open doors, fiendish dire rat scout

Both doors to this Room are open. The following description omits the presence of the fiendish rat.

Peering through the open doorway, you discern for certain that the room is empty. There is an open door that seems to be the only exit.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** The fiendish dire rat most likely ran to join the fight in Room A9. Unless the party defeated the fiendish darkmantle in Room A9 without making noise, the fiendish dire rat fought there and is not here. If the fiendish dire rat is caught unaware, it flees quickly, avoiding combat at all costs.

Wary PCs succeeding at a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check while in the Room hear the sound of hundreds of tiny nails scratching on stone as the fiendish rat swarm approaches.

One round after the PCs enter this Room, the fiendish rat swarm, alerted by its scout, enters from the open north door and attacks. The swarm hisses, leaving a trail of saliva, slime, and urine in its wake. Patches of discolored hair contrast the overwhelming black fur of the swarm. It is unclear if this is a mutation or a sign of disease.

Those who fail their Wisdom (Perception) check are surprised.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The fiendish rat swarm washes into the Room like its namesake, attempting to cover as many PCs as possible within its 10-ft. square. Its members fight to the death, pursuing fleeing PCs.

PCs may use a door to block the progress of the fiendish rat swarm. Although the wave is capable of opening unattended doors, its collective members are too weak to open a door held closed by a PC. Faced with such an obstacle, the wave batters against it for 5 rounds and then looks for a way around the obstacle or seeks out more accessible prey.

If possible, they attack good characters first. Each round, the swarm damages a PC, roll on the following chart.

### Swarm Effects Table

| d20 | Effect |
|:---:|:-------|
| 1-4 | PC suffers 1d3 Intelligence damage as the fiendish aura spreads through the PC's skin. |
| 5-9 | The swarm takes the shape of the PC it attacks, appearing as a shadowy doppelganger. The PC suffers 1d3 Wisdom damage. |
| 10-13 | A darkmantle emerges from the center of the swarm, flies to the ceiling, and descends on a PC. It attacks twice and dissipates into a black mist. |
| 14-18 | A single rat breaks off from the swarm, mutates, grows, and becomes a fiendish dire rat over the course of one round. |
| 19 | The swarm becomes two separate swarms for 2d4 rounds. |
| 20 | PC's armor is tattered, losing one point of AC. |

The swarm is part of the demonic energy that permeates the fading dungeon. To increase the creep factor, have the swarm take on nefarious shapes or produce fear effects. Have their torches dim, etc. The rats are intelligent and might comment on the taste of the character's blood or how killing them now is a kindness compared to what awaits further into the dungeon. Some foreshadowing of potential threats awaiting the PCs is a good way of both increasing tension and playing fair as a GM.

This is only the tenth encounter. Keep the PCs guessing.

**Treasure:** None

**Creatures:** One fiendish rat swarm (possibly one fiendish dire rat scout)

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, add a second fiendish rat swarm. To decrease the challenge, the swarm arrives in 1d4 rounds and does not gain surprise.

### Room A11: Bones in the Hall

**Features:** Kobold skeleton trying to animate, bloody writing, two open doors

Both doors into this hallway are open.

A single small (nonhuman) skeleton lies in this 10-ft. wide hallway. Bits of clothing and leather armor cling to its frame. The skeleton shudders a bit but falls still. It wants to stand but can't. The head turns to face the PCs but then falls off its neck. One hand twitches on the skeleton's belt.

Two open doors, one on either end of the hallway, give no clue as to what lies beyond.

**Initial Attitude:** Varies

**Encounter:** The skeleton is the remains of a kobold captive brought back by an orc patrol and killed by Orghar. He was left here as a warning before being picked clean by the fiendish rat swarm.

If the PCs have not encountered a kobold before, they do not know what the skeleton is. Conversely, allow a DC 15 Wisdom (Nature) check to identify it.

Carefully examining the skeleton shows hundreds of tiny bite marks on the bones and leather armor. Looking through the open doorway to the north reveals four more open doors (Rooms A12 through A15). The skeleton tries to stand and animate, but the magic is weak, and it just twitches.

It mutters the same phrase over and over again in draconic: "The trees are beautiful in Autumn. Serve the Lady of Eggs. It's a bitter harvest. Longtail lies. The bat lies. Save the eggs."

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** None

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the skeleton come to life when the PCs are near. It is not full health and probably won't be much of a match for the PCs, but it should warn them of things to come (much later).

### Room A12: Orc Quarters

**Features:** Trash-covered floor, animal waste smell, destroyed furniture and possessions

The door to this Room is open.

Peering through the open door, you find out this room is a disaster area. Unpleasant hints of animal waste fill the air, and scraps of clothing, bits of wood, and other trash cover the floor.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This was one of the Rooms the orcs used as sleeping quarters. The few items of furniture there, along with the former occupants' clothing, backpacks, and other possessions, have been chewed to pieces by the fiendish rat swarm (Room A10).

The smell is rodent waste with a hint of sulfur. It stings the nose, along with the overpowering scent of urine.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** A successful DC 12 Investigation check allows a PC to visually pick a few salvageable items amid the debris: a rusted, normal dagger, a dented tin drinking cup, three silver coins from a forgotten age, a 5-ft. length of chain, and a bent key that could go to almost anything. A DC 16 Strength check straightens the key. Rolling too high, however, breaks the key.

**Scaling:** N/A

### Room A13: Gnawers

**Features:** Trash-covered floor, sulfurous rodent waste smell, two fiendish dire rats

The door to this room is open.

Unpleasant odors linger. This one greets you before you step through the open door. The smell, combined with the trash-covered floor, makes it clear that the rodents' path of destruction came through here.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Two fiendish dire rats, following the fiendish rat swarm, busily sift through the trash, hoping that the wave missed something. So far, they have had little success. One of them has an extra set of crooked fangs hanging from its mouth. The other has extra, frail limbs dragging behind its body. The limbs are useless but unnerving to look at.

More intelligent than their Prime Material counterparts, these fiendish dire rats work as a team. One sifts through the rubbish while the other keeps watch. Unless the PCs are moving without a light source of any kind, they have no chance to surprise these infernal rodents (DC 22 stealth check).

**Encounter Condition:** Concealment, Fearless

**Tactics:** The fiendish dire rats are difficult to surprise given their scent ability; they can detect the presence of a PC within 30 ft. (although they must be within 5 ft. of a PC to detect his exact location). The fiendish dire rat on watch squeaks a warning to his companion as soon as he spots light or hears the movement of the PCs. Both fiendish dire rats hide in the rubbish that fills the room, requiring a successful DC 16 Perception check to be noticed.

This duo is smart enough to avoid a fight against an obviously much stronger foe. They attack a lone PC or even two, rushing out from ambush to gain surprise or flank (if possible).

If more than two PCs enter the Room at the same time, the fiendish dire rats remain hidden, bursting from hiding only when spotted or if a PC gets too close and fleeing out of the Room toward the northeastern portion of the dungeon.

If the fiendish dire rats attack, they fight until reduced to one-half of their hit points or until outnumbered, at which point they flee. If flight is not possible, they fight to the death. The fiendish dire rats pursue fleeing PCs, attacking the rearmost PC and allowing the others to escape.

**Treasure:** A successful DC 12 Investigation check allows a PC to visually pick one salvageable item amid the debris: old and dented manacles that might fit a child.

**Creatures:** Two fiendish dire rats (one with extra fangs, one with vestigial limbs)

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, give the dire rats a fear ability and/or disease. Consider adding one more dire rat. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, add a third fiendish dire rat but have them all fight over a scrap of food when the PCs enter the Room, giving the PCs a round of surprise.

### Room A14: Orc Quarters

**Features:** Destroyed bed, smashed door, ransacked room, hidden tin box

The door to this Room is open.

Trash lays in the hallway. The smashed door indicates something was already here. Instincts tell you the room has been ransacked. Once inside, you see the remnants of a bed in one corner of this room, but everything else has been thoroughly destroyed.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This was the Room of two orc barbarians and actually contained a bed that one of the pair had scavenged from Room A20. Unfortunately, the fiendish rat swarm has torn the place to bits. The bed is nothing more than a plank on four legs.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** With a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, the PCs notice a small tin box lying under the bed. The box is six inches long, three inches wide, and two inches high. It has a clasp that is held closed by a piece of metal wedged into the ring. On the lid is a lion crest from a nearby kingdom, indicating a human was once here, though it's unclear how long ago. The crest's motto is "Those who serve the lion, serve themselves." GMs are welcome to alter this to fit their own campaign worlds.

The box is not trapped or otherwise locked. Inside, the box is lined with black silk and has three indentations to hold vials. Although there are two vials in the box, one of them is broken, and its contents have settled into the silk. There is currently only one intact vial in the box: a greater potion of healing.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, lock the box. To decrease the challenge, add another vial and indentation.

### Room A15: Cornered Fiendish Darkmantles

**Features:** Overwhelming decay smell, trash ankle-high, bloodstains with purple-black residue, severed body parts

The door to this room is open.

The bitter smell of rodent dung and decay is overwhelming. Trash is strewn across the floor, ankle-high in most places. The occasional bloodstain marks the floor and walls, accompanied by a black and purple inky residue. A severed hand is evident on a small pile of trash, and an exposed arm bone has been gnawed on. A trio of dead rats are nothing more than entrails and bones.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This is a former orc sleeping area; the fiendish rat swarm cleaned out what remained from dozens of previous raids.

Clinging to the ceiling of this Room are two fiendish darkmantles. Realizing they had become prey to a nearby swarm, the pair retreated here to await the rodents' passing. They wait for the danger to pass, clinging to the center of the room. Splotchy purple birthmarks on one of the darkmantles make it easier for it to hide.

**Note:** The pair keeps a close watch on the door by constantly emitting high-frequency sounds, making it almost impossible to surprise them.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush, Darkness

**Tactics:** The fiendish darkmantles work as a team in their pursuit of prey. Once they are aware that it is a group of humanoids — and assuming the odds aren't overwhelmingly against them — one darkmantle moves to position itself directly above the door, while the other moves into the far corner to be harder to spot (DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) for the one above the door, DC 20 for the one in the far corner). If the PC states that he is specifically looking at the ceiling, grant an advantage to the roll.

The fiendish darkmantles surprise the first PC through the door, with the one in the far corner using its surprise round to invoke its darkness ability while the one above the door attacks the PC. Even if the PC spots the fiendish darkmantle on the far wall, the one above the door may still have surprise.

If the duo cannot achieve surprise, the one on the far wall invokes its darkness ability while the other attacks. In all cases, the darkmantles keep the combat near the doorway to prevent numerous PCs from flanking them while, in turn, gaining flanking positions on the PC near the doorway.

If either fiendish darkmantle is reduced to less than one-half their hit points (or is killed), they flee using their darkness ability to help cover their escape. The fiendish darkmantles pursue fleeing PCs, concentrating on the rearmost and letting the others go.

**Treasure:** None

**Creatures:** Two fiendish darkmantles (one with purple birthmarks)

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a third darkmantle inside the room and/or another fiendish darkmantle that attacks a PC in the hall, thus limiting movement. To decrease the challenge, remove the darkmantle's ability to surprise the PCs.

### Room A16: Southern Hallway Room

**Features:** Clean hallway room, open doors, connection to Room A18 stirges

Both doors in this room are open.

You can already see the exit of this room, an open door directly across from you. Like so many rooms before it, the interior is filled with trash. The smell is either improving, or you are growing used to it.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room is empty, save some dust and detritus. The moment the PCs enter this room, roll Wisdom (Perception) checks every round for the fiendish stirges in Room A18 (fiendish stirges have a +0 to Wisdom (Perception) checks; roll as a group). If the PCs are spotted or heard, the fiendish stirges fly down to investigate.

PCs who are capable of seeing through the open doorways into Room A18 (using darkvision) may make DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) checks to see the fiendish stirges. All PCs with a passive Perception of 12 or higher can hear the agitated little beasts.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Visions or Extreme Cold

**Tactics:** Once the nearby darkmantles and stirges are defeated, this is a safe room to rest in.

**Treasure:** None

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish stirges in Room A18 roll at advantage. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish stirges in Room A18 roll at disadvantage.

---

### Room A17: Middle Hallway Room

**Features:** Bare walls, broken wooden triptych, connection to Room A18 stirges

Both the doors in this room are open.

This room looks much like the others, with bare walls and nothing else to look at. A strange wooden triptych has fallen from the wall and broken.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Like Room A16, this room is completely empty. Assuming that neither side has spotted the other, continue to make a single Wisdom (Perception) check each round for the six fiendish stirges in Room A18 as well as for the PCs (DC 12).

**Encounter Condition:** Drafty, Echoes 2

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Now worthless, the wood-etched triptych was probably valuable at one time. The carvings of animals and plants show serene iconography in this otherwise dank environment.

**Scaling:** N/A
