# Region B (continued)

## B97. REBEL BARRACKS

If the goblins hear the PCs coming from Room B96, they fall into a defensive position, adding +4 to their initiative checks.

A small barrack houses a few dozen goblins, their spears are pointed menacingly in your direction, and they look ready to pounce on you at a moment's notice. One goblin, dressed in a leather jerkin, with a badge of office affixed to its front, approaches you, demanding to know what you are doing here.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** This is the first, and last, line of defense the rebel goblins have for their new home. Twelve goblins stand guard, at the ready to defend themselves from danger. If the PCs can convince the goblins they have made a pact with their chieftain, Guk, their attitude shifts to Indifferent. If the goblins believe the PCs are in league with Argliss' goblins, their attitude shifts to Hostile and they immediately attack. If the PCs failed their Dexterity (Stealth) checks in Room B96, the goblins attack them as soon as they enter the room.

**Encounter Condition:** Fearless

**Tactics:** Like all rebels, these goblins lack hobgoblin training and the complex tactics their cousins use. They rely on standard swarm tactics to overwhelm and subdue the PCs. If given a chance, they flank a PC, but almost as if by accident.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove four.

## B98. REBEL ARMORY

Similar to the rest of the rooms in this section of the dungeon, this simple room is lined with weapon racks. Each rack holds simple, crudely crafted short spears. Along the back wall, a single, ornate brass-and-iron long spear hangs by itself on the wall.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room serves as the main armory for the rebel goblins. Like their cousins, they still wield traditional spears. The weapon racks are filled with numerous spears, as well as an ornate long spear.

This room also contains a secret door on its eastern wall, requiring a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate. The door can be opened by pressing the top and bottom stones (pressure triggers) simultaneously. Goblins usually require a "boost" to open this door when passing through.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Aside from two dozen short spears, this room contains a masterwork longspear (+1 nonmagical spear).

**Scaling:** N/A

## B99. SHRINE OF THE STONE SPIRITS

This room is dark and cool. The walls are dark, but somehow inviting as well. Scattered, seemingly at random, on the floor are a wide variety of carved stones.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room has been set up by Guk (Room B95) to honor the stone spirits the rebel goblins worship. If the PCs leave the room as they found it, they earn a measure of respect with the rebel goblins. Any alteration to the room is viewed as a crime and any alliance with the rebels is instantly terminated. Should word spread of the PCs' actions, all further encounters with the rebels instantly have initial attitudes changed to Hostile.

**Encounter Condition:** Hallowed 2

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Numerous carved stones line the floor. While they are valuable to the goblins, they are nearly worthless to anyone else. Argliss (Room B75) may find some use for them, however, and is willing to offer a small reward for their retrieval.

**Scaling:** N/A

## B100. WEAPONSMITH

This square cell of a room is filled with long, straight sticks and bits of stone. In the middle of all this is a lone goblin, feverishly working on a new short spear. He does not appear to notice you... but maybe he does.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** The weaponsmith working here is Kr'n'g (a normal goblin). As long as the PCs do not disrupt him, they can stay and watch him work. If they communicate with him he replies with grunts and gestures. He has work to do and cannot be bothered. If the rebel goblins see the PCs as enemies, he signals an alarm as soon as they enter. He lunges at the PCs with a half-made spear. 16 seconds later a squad of nine goblins arrive from Room B101 to assist the smith.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Kr'n'g defends himself against the PCs to the best of his ability, using the half-completed masterwork spear he is holding as his weapon. He goes on full defense each round, taking the Dodge action and waiting for reinforcements. After a few turns, Kr'n'g assumes reinforcements are on their way and fights less defensively. When the reinforcements arrive, they use standard rebel goblin swarm tactics.

**Treasure:** The room is filled with the parts to make three dozen masterwork spears, but nothing else.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, have 1d4 extra goblins arrive in the first round of combat. To decrease the challenge, have only five goblins arrive.

## B101. MEETING HALL

Wooden benches and tables line the walls and fill the room. Ten goblins, previously talking boisterously, grow quiet as you enter the room. This simply furnished room serves as the goblins' communal room.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** Unwelcome intruders, the PCs earn the glare of ten rebel goblin warriors, who have stopped their conversation to determine the fate of the PCs. As long as the attitude toward the PCs is not Hostile (in relation to the rebels), they are left alone. The goblins do not speak as long as the PCs are around. If the initial attitude toward the PCs is Hostile, or if they attack the goblins, the rebels assault the PCs immediately.

**Encounter Condition:** Fearless

**Tactics:** These goblins have not been trained by the hobgoblins and do not have a handle on the complex tactics their cousins do. They fight with conviction (gaining +2 to Wisdom saving throws) but lack the tactical acumen of the goblins from the previous Section. The rebels swarm tactics and overwhelm the PCs, in an attempt to subdue them and hold them hostage.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove four.

## B102. CROWDED WORG STABLE

Growls, snapping jaws, and the stink of live animals, saturate the air. Four large, shaggy beasts are confined behind shaky-looking wooden pens. The wooden slats strain and buckle as the worgs try to free themselves. How the goblins ride these monsters into battle is unimaginable; the thought of taming them seems laughable enough.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Inside the pens, chained to the walls, are four worgs. They are vicious animals, slowly being turned mad by the Fear in this room. The goblins have placed them here, unsure why their temperament is so chaotic, but remain unwilling to relocate.

**Encounter Condition:** Fear 14, Fearless

**Tactics:** Since the worgs are chained up, it's an easy kill if the PCs want to finish them. If the PCs get too close, the worgs attack. They cannot coordinate their attacks, however, and snap at anything in range.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, unchain the worgs. To decrease the challenge, have the worgs sleeping.

## B103. EMPTY WORG STABLE

The empty stable is devoid of anything of use to you. Hay bales line the wall and the floor is scattered with debris. The air is heavy and oppressive.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Whether it was the death of a beast that lived here, or something else, the air in this room is impossible to breathe. The smell is foul and oppressive, stinging the PCs' eyes.

**Encounter Condition:** Negative Energy, Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** If the PCs brave the odor and search the room, allow DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) checks to find a **+1 silver dagger**.

**Scaling:** N/A

## B104. SECRET PASSAGE

This room contains a secret door on both its eastern and western walls, requiring a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate. The doors can be opened by pressing the top and bottom stones (pressure triggers) at the same time. Goblins usually require a "boost" to open this door when passing through.

The door on the eastern wall has a stack of barrels behind it, in the hopes of barring entry. A DC 14 Athletics check is required to push it open from the outside.

This long, narrow corridor stretches along the southern end of the rebel encampment. From what you can tell it simply leads from one end to the other.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This passage is used frequently by the goblins, but is often kept locked or barred because whatever is living in Region C should be avoided. The goblins spent a great deal of time digging up stones and adding a spiked pit trap (Room B1) in the center of the hallway.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, increase depth of the spiked pit trap to 100 ft. To reduce the challenge, change the spiked pit trap to a pit trap (Room B40).

## B105. REMEMBERER'S HOVEL

Quaintly appointed, for a goblin's home, this room is the most impressive in the encampment. The floor is covered with a rug made of some animal's hide. Small carvings and markings adorn the walls. In the middle of the room sits a very old goblin. His skin is dull, leathery, and spotted.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** This room is the living quarters of the oldest goblin in the rebel faction. His name is Rememberer, and at nearly 15 years old, he is ancient. He is the last repository of the goblin culture before the coming of the new god. He remembers the stories and ways of his people, and gladly tells the PCs what he knows, hoping to find an heir for his knowledge before he passes into the rock. The PCs can learn much of the history of the goblins from the Rememberer. As long as the initial attitude does not shift to Hostile or the PCs threaten the Rememberer, he imparts his knowledge.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The Rememberer is quite old, and in no condition to fight off the PCs. Instead of fighting, he begins singing a song to fascinate the PCs. Allow the goblins in Room B101 a Wisdom (Perception) check each turn to hear the song. If they succeed, they arrive in 6d6 seconds to aid the Rememberer, fighting the PCs as if they had just harmed a goblin child. Once reinforcements arrive, they draw the PCs away from the Rememberer, allowing him to escape the room. Once safe, he flees to Room B95, while the goblins lead the PCs towards Room B97. If forced to remain in the room, the Rememberer aids the fighting goblins in battle. If he must escape he casts, *expeditious retreat*, and then *pass without trace* to disguise the direction he ran in.

**Treasure:** The Rememberer is familiar with the oral histories of his people. In addition, he wears a coral necklace (the origins of which are unknown to him) worth 50 gp. It is actually an **Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location**, but he doesn't know that, because it doesn't radiate magic.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, the reinforcements arrive at the end of the Rememberer's first turn. To decrease the challenge, the reinforcements arrive at the end of the Rememberer's third turn.

## B106. THE REBEL CHIRURGEON

This room is a grisly mess. A few forlorn cots line the back wall. The lumpy shapes under the rotten cloth blankets leave little to the imagination. In the center of the room, standing over the lifeless body of a goblin, is the rebel's chirurgeon, sewing together what is left of the dead soldier.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** The goblin chirurgeon has just performed surgery on a rebel goblin, to no avail. While Guk (Room B95) calls upon the power of the stone spirits, he's not adept at healing. This young goblin chirurgeon has been tasked with fixing the raiders that return to the encampment, which is becoming more and more of a losing proposition. He is frightened and skittish and does not like the presence of the PCs one bit. Black, his bat familiar, is here too.

If attacked the chirurgeon flees, crying for help. If he alerts the guards housed in Room B97, they arrive a turn later.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The chirurgeon does everything in his power to escape the PCs. While he has a few spells at his disposal, he casts *burning hands* if cornered and *sleep* if he sees someone casting spells. Once the guards arrive they assist the chirurgeon and attack the PCs. Like all rebels, these goblins lack hobgoblin training and the complex tactics their cousins use. The rebels use standard swarm tactics to overwhelm and subdue the PCs. They guard the adept as best as they can, and look menacing if necessary.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove four goblins.

## B107. GUK'S QUARTERS

Large and empty, this room is much nicer than others in the area. While spartan, a large sleeping area has been made up in the middle of the room, and various hides and weapons cover the walls. Leaning against the back wall is a club, with a wicked-looking spike of iron driven through its head.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Guk (Room B95) and the majority of rebels, aside from those in the secret encampment, are still in Room B95. If the PCs have gotten this far they either have Guk's trust, or the PCs have already dealt with the rebel chieftain.

The hides and weapons on the walls are testaments to the goblin kings of the past. They are all Guk could smuggle out during his exodus from Argliss' regime. Guk's personal greatclub is here; he does not feel he needs to wield it in the safety of his own hall and leaves it in this room when he is not raiding his cousins to the west.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the PCs have somehow yet to meet Guk, there is a 50% chance he is here alone, and startled to find strangers in his quarters. His initial attitude is Unfriendly, as he does not trust foreigners.

**Treasure:** Guk's **+1 greatclub** is the only significant treasure in the room. The weapons on the walls are standard spears and short swords. They are all old and rusty, however.

**Scaling:** N/A

## B108. REBEL GUARD ROOM

This room, like many in this area, is filled with spear-wielding goblins. Along the north wall is a weapon rack filled with sharpened wooden spears and javelins. Apparently nothing has threatened them recently, as they look quite bored and eager for a fight.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** This room is staffed by ten of Guk's goblin warriors. They monitor the northern passages for incursions by the goblin king's forces. Occasionally they hunt the creatures that wander into these halls from the untamed rooms (Rooms B109 through B131).

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** These goblins are bored and agitated with their assignment. They are looking for anything distracting. If their attitude with the PCs is anything but Hostile, they strike up a conversation (in Goblin) or offer to play knucklebones or cards. If the PCs have Guk's favor, they even offer them places to sit and relax, eager for company.

If the attitude is currently Hostile, the rebel goblins tear into the PCs, fighting with a fierceness they have not seen in goblins. Treat the goblins as enraged (per the barbarian rage class ability) and give them a +2 to their initiative.

Like all rebels, these goblins have not been trained by the hobgoblins and do not have the complex tactics their cousins do. However, they are fond of flanking and poking the PCs at every turn. One of them has a vial of acid and another one has dragon bile smeared on his blade (3 doses). Any goblin that cannot get in to fight the PCs, throws a spear (increase their "shortbow" damage to 1d8 to represent this) overhead in an attempt to harm PC spellcasters and those hanging back. They move to the weapon's rack to retrieve more if necessary.

**Treasure:** There are three spears and three javelins for every goblin in a weapons rack along the north wall. It requires a bonus action to grab one. Large or larger creatures can grab two in one go.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add four goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove four goblins.

## B109-B119. THE UNTAMED ROOMS

None of the goblinoid races lay claim to this rubble-filled expanse. The earthquake hit this part of the dungeon hardest. A number of the traps originally laid down have been destroyed. Blink dogs, dire wolves, howlers, and other monsters make their home in this rough expanse. Howls, high-pitched whining, and growls echo throughout the hallways.

The hallways are strewn with rubble and debris. Most of the rubble is the facing of the walls that came loose. Some of it is the remains of walls. The footing is treacherous and the wild monsters make the area dangerous. There are good reasons the goblinoids have not settled the area previously.

With the shrine to their new deity in the northeastern section of this expanse, Argliss and his goblins began entering the area more frequently. They even set up a way station for pilgrims and scouts to stay during the arduous trip from their empire to the shrine.

The bugbears have used the long, dangerous trip of the goblins to their advantage. They too have set up a small bivouac. From it, they harass the goblin pilgrims and scouts. Their presence, coupled with the naturally wild monsters, makes this perhaps the most volatile area in the entire Region.

Each room is assumed to have **Poor Footing 3** in addition to any other Encounter Conditions.

### Random Encounters

Roll for a Random Encounter once per hour.

| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|-----------|
| 1 | The PCs have walked into an area that is pitch black. The air is oppressive and a chill runs up the spines of the PCs. **Deep Darkness, Fear 14.** |
| 2 | Shadows jump across the hallway. The briefest of movement plays just at the corner of the PC's vision. Exactly what it is may not be evident, however. **Distracting Visions.** |
| 3 | Something is not right about the expanse ahead. The lead PC is convinced it is a perfect spot for an ambush (whether or not this is true is up to the GM). **Cursed 4.** |
| 4-10 | Nothing. |
| 11 | A dire wolf stalks the halls. This room is strewn with debris; damage from the earthquake. The wolf lies in wait for the PCs, attacking when they are in range. **Ambush, Cover.** |
| 12 | Two ethereal marauders investigate this room. Rubble and broken bits of some ancient trap cover the floor and the marauders are digging through them. They suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. |
| 13 | Hovering over three goblin corpses is a lone howler. Since the goblins were not a challenge, the howler unleashes its fury on the PCs. **Fearless.** |
| 14 | A pack of three blink dogs moves slowly through the hall. They are wounded (-5 hp), having just concluded an encounter with dire wolves. Unfriendly unless attacked. |
| 15 | A pack of four dire wolves limp along. They are wounded (-10 hp), having just fought a rival pack of blink dogs They are on the alert for any attack, despite their wounds. **Ambush.** |
| 16 | A goblin hunting party is engaged in a fight with a pair of vargouilles. Seven goblins remain—the corpses of five of their compatriots clog the battlefield. The goblins and vargouilles are too distracted to notice the PCs. They suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. |
| 17 | Three wights lurk in the halls, searching for easy prey. They encounter the PCs in this rubble-strewn, dark room, attacking the PCs from the safety of the shadows. **Ambush, Concealment, Cover.** |
| 18 | A pit trap (Room B40) has been constructed in the path the PCs are taking. Should they decide to avoid the trap, it takes 30 minutes to find a path around. |
| 19 | A goblin rounds the corner, and in a panic, it fires an *acid arrow* spell at the front PC and scurries away. |
| 20 | Bartleby stands over the corpse of a dire wolf. He is fatigued from the encounter. Reduce Bartleby's hp by 10. He does not ask the PCs for assistance and leaves as soon as he spots them. |

## B109. PASSAGES OF DEATH

The door on the northern wall is open. Rubble and broken, armored skeletons, and other detritus litter the hall. Ominous sounds emanate from the west of the room, echoing off the cavernous walls. To the east is a small passage leading away into darkness.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** When the demon Falortuligo broke from its prison in Room C21, he broke into Region B through the doors here and finally into Room B111 where he was killed. The skeletons are a few of the paladins who died fighting him.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises, Haunted, Hazardous Footing 15, Unhallowed

**Tactics:** Just being here should unnerve the PCs. The sights, sounds, and sensations of these dead soldiers combine to create an aura of uneasy death. These men died horribly. Close examination of the bodies shows parts of bone missing from the ribs, legs, jaws, and arms as if some great force tore them away before they died.

**Treasure:** There are a total of three skeletons, each wearing a **+1 chain shirt**, with masterwork longswords (+1 nonmagical longswords) on their belts, and tabards of the Order of Myrunn still hanging on their broken frames. One of the bodies wears a generic signet ring (with a cross) that can double as a silver holy symbol, should a PC require one.

**Scaling:** N/A

## B110. FRIGHTENED AND ALONE

The northern door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 24 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to unlock. The southeastern door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 27 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to unlock.

Unless the PCs succeed at a DC 25 Dexterity (Stealth) check while opening the lock, read the following.

Sitting in the corner of this dark and empty room is a single goblin. His eyes are streaked with tears as he shakes fearfully, barely managing to hold a sharpened stick to defend himself.

If the PCs succeed in picking the lock quietly, read the following.

The room is dark and empty. In one of the corners, a single goblin whimpers and cries to himself. His hands tremble as he stares at the sharpened stick in his hand.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** This rebel goblin, Klibb (a normal, if somewhat pathetic goblin possessing an above-average Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) of +6), has been locked inside this room for 3 days. Fearing whatever is in Room B111, he locked himself in this room. However, in doing so, he broke off his pick in one of the locks and has been unable to escape. To make matters worse, the room is haunted and he's been unable to sleep with the noises, chattering, and unexplained shadows hovering around him all night long. He's down to one last candle for light but refuses to use it for fear that he may be in this room for a long while yet.

**Encounter Condition:** Haunted

**Tactics:** Klibb does not want to fight and gladly throws himself at the mercy of the PCs. If they intend to kill him he greets death willingly, though if they leave an opening for escape he takes it. If they offer to let him join, he gladly accepts and escorts them wherever they want to go.

This is a perfect opportunity to drop a new PC into the group. If a goblin is not on the menu of acceptable races for players, replace Klibb with just about anything that fits, including an elf deserter from Region H. It makes the most sense for Klibb (or his replacement) to be a rogue, but if another goblin lies dead in the room who actually locked the doors from the inside, Klibb can be any class.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** Do not increase or decrease the challenge of this encounter.

## B111. KILLING GROUNDS

This room is evil; you can feel it in your bones. The floor is covered in debris and is slightly tacky. Any sound you make, as well as a few others, echo throughout the chamber loudly. To say you have a bad feeling about this cavernous room is an understatement.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This is perhaps the most dangerous room in the entire Region. An epic battle took place here ages ago (see Region C) and the effects of the battle still linger. The conditions of the room are tough to handle, but that is not the worst of it. Soon after the PCs enter the room, six corrupted ghoul paladins—dressed in magical chain mail, carrying unholy swords, and wearing the tabards of the Order of Myrunn—attack the PCs. They are fearless and descend without hesitation, merely waiting for the appropriate moment to strike.

They do not look like typical ghouls. While their skin is tight, eyes hollow, and claws sharpened to razor-like perfection, they carry themselves with regal authority and wield swords as though they were born to. Their helmets hide everything but their fangs and empty eyes. Their weapons gleam with unnerving energy.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush, Concealment, Cursed 5, Desecration 6, Echoes 10, Fear 14, Fearless, Haunted, Hazardous Footing 16, Negative Energy, Unhallowed

**Tactics:** The ghouls alternate between bite, claw, and longsword attacks. They know that a paralyzed victim is easier to subdue, but they cannot deny their paladin heritage. They maintain an aura of fear, in addition to the Fear effect of the room.

The ghouls work like a team, ganging up on stragglers and distracting the weak. They have a strong hatred for clerics and wizards (seeing Arum as the cause of their death). They do not put themselves in harm's way but do their best to kill spellcasters before they can "boost" the PCs.

If the PCs cannot dispatch the ghouls quickly enough, they run the risk of drawing the attention of other nearby monsters. After 11 rounds of combat, roll for a Random Encounter. If the result is odd, the Random Encounter occurs, forcing the PCs to deal with even more foes. If not, roll again on the 12th round of combat. If the result is even, the Random Encounter occurs. Do not roll for further encounters beyond this point.

**Treasure:** Having rotted their magical weapons and armor from their caustic and unholy touch, their swords and chain shirts turn to dust when the ghouls die.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one corrupted paladin. To decrease the challenge, remove the magical arms and armor from the corrupted paladins.

## B112-B115. PRISON CELLS

While part and parcel of the surrounding Section, these four rooms have specific significance. They are prison cells that at one time or another held demons, devils, and undead. Some of the rooms still have occupants and all the doors are locked and guarded by glyphs. GMs can describe the doors while the PCs stand in Room B111, but until they touch them, there is no chance of knowing what will happen.

### B112. DARKNESS AGAIN

The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. Unlike the other rooms in this area, the glyph on this door triggers the door to open when read.

This simple room is empty and dark. Light recedes and dissipates, almost swallowed by the darkness. The floor, from what you can see, is strangely free of dust.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Whatever once lived here is gone, having escaped when a foolish goblin read the glyph on the door. Most likely a wight, it either escaped into the dungeon or was killed by the ghouls in Room B111.

**Encounter Condition:** Deep Darkness, Desecration 3, Negative Energy

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** If the PCs spend 30 minutes searching the room (and have adequate light), allow a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find a loose stone in the floor. A DC 11 Strength (Athletics) check lifts the stone from its perch. The stone is nearly 200 lbs. and covers a small area the size of a halfling. Buried under the stone is a suit of **+1 unholy splint mail**, obviously hidden away so it could never be used against the forces of good. It radiates evil and afflicts good-aligned PCs who don it with a Harrowing Curse.

**Unholy armor** grants resistance to damage dealt by good-aligned creatures. In addition, when the wearer is struck, the attacker must succeed a Charisma saving throw (DC 14) or be afflicted with a Harrowing Curse.

**Harrowing Curse.** Until it is removed, or one week passes, cursed creatures that roll initiative must succeed a Wisdom saving throw (DC 14) or be frightened of all undead for 10 turns. The save may be repeated at the end of each of their turns. Creatures already in combat when this curse is applied must immediately make the save again.

**Scaling:** N/A

### B113. TRAPPED WIGHT

The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 24 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. In addition, the door is trapped with a *glyph of warding*, protecting the contents of the room from escape. Tampering with the door or lock in any manner triggers it.

A small tomb-like room rests to the northeast of the large circular room. The contents are spartan and darkness extends to every corner. Before you can think, something has crept from the shadows.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Two insane wights have been trapped in this room since its creation. Being undead, they do not understand the passage of time as humans do but nonetheless have maintained a semblance of reality that finally drove them mad. Insane, they howl with an allip-like moan.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), Distracting Noises, Fear 15, Fearless, Unhallowed

**Tactics:** The insane wights attack immediately, taking advantage of surprised PCs. They babble incessantly, as they attack each PC in turn.

**Treasure:** If the PCs have adequate light, allow a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find a series of loose flagstones in the floor. Buried under the stones is a **+1 unholy morningstar**, obviously hidden away so it could never be used against the forces of good. A DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check lifts the stones.

**Unholy weapons** deal an extra 1d4 necrotic damage to good-aligned creatures. In addition, when a creature is struck by the weapon, it must succeed a Charisma save (DC 14) or be afflicted with a Harrowing Curse (Room 112). Good-aligned creatures touching unholy weapons are instantly afflicted with the curse.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one wight. To decrease the challenge, remove the allip-like babbling ability from the wights.

### B114. HELL ON EVERY EARTH

The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. In addition, the door is trapped with a *glyph of warding* (3rd level, explosive, thunder), protecting the contents of the room from escape. Tampering with the door or lock in any manner triggers it.

From the darkness, you can hear an unhealthy moan, something sinister and decrepit. The darkness cuts your torchlight and the moan grows louder as you peer into the shadows.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** A ghast of unusual strength has been trapped in this room since the dungeon's creation. Once shackled, it broke those bonds long ago. Now the manacles and chains hang from a metal ring in the wall. The floor is littered with sepsis and slime, making walking difficult.

The ghast has no love of the living and attacks immediately.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), Concealment, Fearless, Poor Footing 4, Unhallowed

**Tactics:** Taking advantage of the darkness, the ghast rushes the first PC, in an attempt to pin him. Using the darkness to his advantage he gains a +4 to his Strength check to grapple them. Once on the ground, he attacks ferociously, biting and clawing until the victim is paralyzed. He then moves on to the next victim using the same tactics, paralyzing the PC and moving on to the next.

The ghast is a fearsome predator and uses its mechanisms to finish off the PCs.

**Treasure:** If the PCs spend 30 minutes searching the room (and have adequate light), they can find a broken stone in the floor. A DC 9 Strength (Athletics) check lifts the pieces of broken stone easily. Nothing is buried here, having been taken by the ghast.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, give the ghast +3 AC. To reduce the challenge, remove the ghast's teeth, forcing it to fight only with its claws.

### B115. SEVERED VARGOUILLES

From outside the door, the PCs can hear the muffled shriek of something far off. In actuality, the vargouilles inside are shrieking at a fever pitch, but the walls of the dungeon suppress the volume of their screams. As soon as the door is opened, the shriek hits them at full volume.

The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. In addition, the door is trapped with a *glyph of warding* (3rd level, explosive, fire), preventing the contents of the room from escaping. Tampering with the door or lock in any manner triggers it.

As soon as the door opens a feverish shriek blasts your senses, striking your psyche with an impossibly loud sound. The room, shrouded in darkness, shows no signs of occupants, but the shrieks cannot be ignored.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** From the darkness, four vargouilles shriek and scream. The PCs cannot see them because it's dark, but if they can get closer, they see four heads spiked to iron rods in the wall, some ten feet above the floor. Striking them should be easy enough, should the PCs have a weapon that can reach them.

**Encounter Condition:** Concealment, Distracting Noises, Deep Darkness, Fear 14

**Tactics:** The vargouilles are spiked to the walls, unable to move, but unwilling to die. They have been shrieking for thousands of years, trapped in this constant state of agony. Unable to deny their unholy heritage, they scream continuously, no matter what the PCs do. They cannot move, and want nothing more than to be free of this living hell they are trapped in. Death is the most obvious answer, but escape is their goal.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, do not have the vargouilles spiked to the wall but flying about at will. To decrease the challenge, reduce each vargouille to 1 hit point each, representing the constant state of near death that they "live" in.

## B116. ISOLATED REBELS

As the PCs approach this room, allow Wisdom (Perception) checks to overhear the goblins inside, counting and bickering. While not hostile toward one another, or shouting, they are busy dividing up their loot.

There is a 50% chance one goblin stands guard in front of the door. Otherwise, everyone is inside, with one goblin watching the door from the back wall.

This small, cramped room is filled with rebel goblin warriors, sitting down and sifting through a small pile of coins and gems. Before you can do anything, they grab their spears and attack.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Nine goblin warriors left Room B108 out of boredom. Wishing to explore the dungeon, they braved the maze, snuck passed the goblins in Room B86 and so on, and made their way through the trapped rooms in the center of the Region.

None of this was difficult, but the goblin keeping track of where they were going died under a portcullis trap and they have been stuck in this Section for weeks now. The other goblins in the rebel encampment presume they are dead. Since they have been gone for so long, they do not know whether the PCs are loyal to the rebels or not. As such, they are treated no better than their traitorous cousins. Unless the PCs can show some sign of their allegiance to the rebel goblins (and quickly), they are attacked as soon as the PCs enter the room.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises

**Tactics:** These goblins are ragged and frazzled, their mental state shaken for the duration of this fight. They attack with an intense need to kill. The PCs should be allowed a chance to calm them down (spells work, for instance). If 50% of the goblins come to their senses, they all stop fighting and invite the PCs in, hoping they can guide them home.

The goblins have encountered the blink dogs in Room B117 but keep to themselves, knowing better than to antagonize the beasts.

**Treasure:** While exploring, they were able to collect a small pile of treasure that they were divvying up (for the 40th time) when the PCs interrupted. There are 116 sp, 23 gp, an uncut sapphire (350 gp), and a **potion of gaseous form**.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, add three goblins. To decrease the challenge, remove two.

## B117. BLINK DOG DEN

The door to this room is open, its lock broken.

In the midst of all the chaos in this section of the dungeon, this room feels safe. An easy calm washes over you and the room itself seems to be an enticing place to rest. The peace is broken as a series of low growls fill the air.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** The PCs have entered a blink dog den. Resting from the rigors of the Section, four blink dogs (hp 40, 32, 24, 14) rest on beds of cloth and adventuring gear. They do not attack the PCs initially, but they make their dislike of the PCs' invasion clear. The blink dogs bare their fangs, growling and yapping at the PCs. If the PCs do not leave, the blink dogs slowly advance, hoping to drive them off. If any PCs attack, they immediately retaliate.

Any ranger or druid amongst the PCs can attempt a DC 20 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to calm the dogs. Success allows the PCs to remain and rest in the room though the blink dogs are obviously not pleased with the PCs' presence.

**Encounter Condition:** [Safe]

**Tactics:** The three largest blink dogs launch themselves at the PCs, with the alpha male protecting the smallest and youngest blink dog. They focus on the most aggressive PCs first, concentrating on one enemy at a time. They use their limited blink ability to flank the PCs.

If the alpha male is killed, the second largest takes command of the pack. If it dies, the remaining blink dogs cower in a corner until the PCs leave or finish them off.

The smallest is too old to train at this point, having been feral too long to be of use to animal trainers. However, since blink dogs are lawful good creatures, they prefer not to fight. But being trapped in the dungeon, they grow more and more feral with the passage of time. Rangers and druids may attempt to calm the blink dogs, requiring a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check in place of Charisma (Diplomacy) checks. If the PCs remain for 2 hours or more, another check is required, lest the alpha male grow restless.

If the PCs clear the goblins out of B116 and keep the portcullis in Room B118 down, this room is considered Safe.

**Treasure:** Among the adventuring gear the blink dogs were resting on are two coils of 50 ft. rope, a backpack, six candles, a tinder box, a rusty carving knife, and a waterskin filled with holy water.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one blink dog. To decrease the challenge, remove one.

## B118. MOSS-FILLED GUARD CHAMBER

The portcullis blocking the PC's path is down. In order to open it, the PCs must pull the lever (inside the room) down.

Deep green moss covers the walls and ceiling of this room. The only bare stone is the floor. The moss is rich and thick, taking on the appearance of an expensive carpet. The air in this room is thick and pungent as well. The moss appears to be sucking all the freshness out of the room. Along the west wall, a lever juts out.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The walls and ceiling of this room are the remnants of an ancient celestial trap that was damaged in the earthquake. Touching the lever triggers a poison dust trap, but opens the portcullis.

**Poison Dust Trap.** Hidden inside the lever compartment is a glass vial (visible with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception check)). Pulling the lever crushes the vial releasing a puff of noxious gas. Creatures within 5 ft of the lever must succeed a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the poison is not cured before that time the victim receives 5d10 poison damage when it ends. A DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check is required to pull the vial out without dropping it, which would set it off.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** Along the western wall is a lever that, when pulled down, raises the portcullis in the hallway. When pushed up, the portcullis lowers.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, replace the poison dust trap's effect with insanity mist vapor (Room B8). To decrease the challenge, remove the trap and raise the portcullis.

## B119. ABANDONED OUTPOST

The door to this room is locked, requiring a DC 30 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. The door can be locked from the inside or outside.

This room was once an outpost of some sort; that much is obvious at least. A rotted framework, probably for bunk beds, leans against one wall. A large, stained table takes up the center of the room. On the eastern wall, there is a slight discoloration in the center from a map that once hung there. Along the back wall is a weapons rack.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This outpost has been abandoned for a long time. The furniture is old, and the floor is littered with rubble and debris.

No matter how long the PCs search the room, they cannot determine who used the room, or what they used it for; it dates back to the time of the battle that took place in Room B111. The map that hung on the wall has long since been destroyed, and the only things on the table are dark stains. The weapon rack in the back of the room seems to be in decent repair and still holds a few weapons.

**Encounter Condition:** Hazardous Footing 5, [Safe]

**Tactics:** If the PCs lock the door from the inside, nothing can get in to disturb them. The locals consider this room unreachable anyway.

**Treasure:** At first glance, the weapon's rack appears trapped, but a DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check reveals that the trigger is fake, designed to trick would-be thieves. Over the years the "tripline" has rotted and nothing resembling a trap remains.

The weapons of a long-dead soldier hang on the weapon rack, holding a **+1 longbow** and a **+1 buckler** in addition to a few mundane odds and ends. The GM should place a few javelins and arrows on the rack for PCs to replenish their supplies.

**Scaling:** N/A
