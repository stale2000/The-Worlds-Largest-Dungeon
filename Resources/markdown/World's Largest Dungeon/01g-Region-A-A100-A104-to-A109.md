# Region A (continued)

## A100-A104: The Chapel

Rooms A100 to A104 contain the long-forgotten chapel as well as some ancillary rooms. The chapel was abandoned ages ago, and because this area is effectively isolated, the humanoids never bothered with it.

All of these encounters are fights. The GM should plan these encounters ahead and not just open the book the day the PCs encounter these rooms.

Currently, Longtail and Achsyyx make the chapel their home. The wererat has isolated himself from the other factions, now a victim of his own ambitions. The PCs most likely encounter them separately, though merciless GMs may have them fight the PCs together or, at the very least, come to the other's aid (Rooms A101 and A103).

In addition, a fiendish owlbear is rampaging through the area completely out of control.

Random encounters do not occur in this section.

---

## A100: Prisoner Holding Cell

The door to this room has been smashed open. Before the PCs get too close, they can hear the sounds of combat and bestial shrieks from inside.

**Note:** This is a difficult and complicated encounter.

The door has been smashed open, lying broken and off its hinges. A mixture of splintered wood and twisted metal bands lie scattered in the doorway. Despite the gloom, it is possible to discern the carnage within.

A huge, feathered monstrosity with a raptor's head utters horrid shrieks as it rampages through the room. Fresh blood sticks to its coat, and it carries a flying octopus clutched in one claw, entrails hanging from its beak. At least half a dozen more flying octopi lie dead around it, their bodies torn open. Another, obviously heavily wounded, flies about the room in panic. Small empty force cages line the walls.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
This is the latest creature to step through the 'doorway' opened by Longtail. Enraged beyond reason, the fiendish owlbear kills anything in its path. The darkmantles had the misfortune to be resting here when the fiendish owlbear emerged.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
The fiendish owlbear is enraptured by its bloodlust and is enjoying the destruction of the much weaker fiendish creatures, much as it enjoyed the killing of the humanoids in Rooms A101 and A102. It is momentarily distracted by its quest for the last remaining fiendish creatures and does not immediately notice the PCs. This is compounded by the low light within the room. At the start of the encounter, the fiendish owlbear has disadvantage on all Perception checks related to sight, unless the PCs possess a light source.

Once it spots the PCs, it attacks the nearest, swatting with its claws and biting with its beak. Due to its damage reduction, it has not been seriously hurt or challenged and thinks nothing of the insignificant creatures that come into its field of vision.

Despite its evident rage, the fiendish owlbear is not stupid. If an opponent manages to deal 10 or more damage in a single turn (after applying resistances), the fiendish owlbear turns its attention solely toward that individual and can pursue it without drawing attacks of opportunity. In any case, once hurt, it focuses its efforts solely on those who have hurt it and ignores those who haven't. Furthermore, if reduced to one-half of its hit points or fewer, it attempts to escape, bull-rushing and otherwise fighting its way out of the room and down the hall; it only fights to the death as a last resort.

The moment the fiendish owlbear is distracted, the remaining fiendish darkmantle flees as best it can.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
- **To increase the challenge:** Increase the fiendish owlbear's hp to 92.
- **To decrease the challenge:** Have the fiendish owlbear already injured at the hands of Longtail (see Room A104). It starts instead with 57 hit points.

---

## A101: Hideout

As the PCs approach this room, from either direction, read the following.

Nearly a dozen orc and kobold bodies lie strewn across the hallway, vicious slash marks on their bodies. Three dead orcs are pressed against the iron-bound door as if trying to get in.

The door to this room is locked and barred from the inside. Longtail has sealed himself inside and left the others to deal with the owlbear. A **DC 20 Strength** check is required to bash it in. Unlocking it requires a **DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight-of-Hand)** check but does nothing.

The PCs may bypass this room because they cannot get in. There is nothing wrong with this. Longtail can be a long-term problem for Region B and Region E. But as the PCs advance in level, the GM needs to advance Longtail's stats as well.

A large, surprisingly clean chamber confronts you. A pile of empty crates and barrels are clumsily stacked in the center of the room, swaying slightly. The room's only occupant stands behind the tower — a single wererat staring you down in a defensive posture. He looks angry, like someone having a very bad day. You suddenly feel sleepy...

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The orcs and kobolds were part of the small expedition that Longtail led to search for the chapel. They were killed by the owlbear when told to hold the door. Longtail is desperate now, not knowing who the PCs are or why they've come, but being generally paranoid, he initially assumes they're here to assassinate him.

Longtail has stacked some empty barrels and some broken-down crates in the center of the room to use as cover. It is haphazard and makeshift, but it'll do the trick in a pinch.

A number of things are about to happen as the PCs enter the room.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
There is virtually no way for Longtail to be surprised by the PCs. He moves to confront them as soon as he is properly prepared. Either he heard them coming in, or Achsyyx has already warned him.

The wererat is already in hybrid form and stays that way throughout the encounter. If Longtail is disguised as Nylinn and traveling with the PCs, this is his opportunity to escape to Room A104.

The moment he hears the PCs bashing on the door, Longtail dons his **goggles of night** before casting **expeditious retreat** and **guidance** on himself, then moving to either the left or right hall doorway, depending on which one the PCs are furthest from.

Once the door opens, Longtail casts **sleep** and attempts to snipe at the remaining PCs using **magic missile** or his wand. If there are too many enemies closing in on him, he uses his superior speed to evade or retreat to Room A102. If things get too tight, he can use **fly** and **invisibility** to buy himself some space.

Although Longtail opened the gateway, the disappointing results have left him less than eager to fight for its possession. As long as things go his way in a fight, he is happy to duke it out. But if he is reduced to one-half or fewer hit points, he retreats.

He hides from the PCs within the dungeon, waiting for them to leave. If Achsyyx is still alive, he may join Longtail after the fight begins. However, if Longtail must, he leaves Achsyyx to make his own way. Only if escape is impossible, or he is about to die, does Longtail offer a truce, hoping to leave on his own terms. If even this prospect is dim, then he will beg for surrender.

If allowed to live and/or escape, Longtail heads north to Region E. He doesn't know what is there. It's just a random direction he's headed in. However, the parlay between Longtail and the PCs is likely to be lengthy and involve some negotiation.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
- **To increase the challenge:** Give Longtail **haste** instead of **fly** and have **invisibility** already cast before the PCs arrive. In addition, add a fiendish rat swarm under his command.
- **To decrease the challenge:** Allow Longtail only two unused spell slots per level and reduce his hit point total by 20 (he has already had a run-in with the owlbear).

---

## A102: Holdout

The door to this room is open and shows signs of having been hammered against. If Longtail has retreated to this room, he may close the door and try to lock it, taking an action to do so. If locked, the PCs can bash it open with a **DC 14 Strength** check or pick the lock with a **DC 15 Dexterity** check.

Large basins and tubs fill the room. Ritual glyphs and sigils line the walls. Several basins are cracked or broken open completely. One massive tub is raised and made of brass or bronze. Angelic heads are carved into all the bas-relief features. Water trickles, almost magically, from a font raised high against the south wall. It flows into each tub and basin. The excess water drains into cracks in the floor.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
There is only an encounter here if Longtail has retreated.

This was a ritual bathing area. Symbols of purification are etched carefully into the walls. They have stood the test of time. Several deities names are also etched on the wall. Pick some from your home campaign.

A shelf in the southeast corner has rusted ritual daggers on it. The shelf above that has places for soap and brushes is now long gone.

Along the southern wall are holy, non-magical glyphs and pictographs showing the eight stages of ritual cleansing. None of them mention the daggers, which begs the question. Why not?

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
Longtail's tactics remain the same. He attempts to flee if he can. Otherwise, he tries to work an angle for peace. If that doesn't work, he uses the broken basins and tubs as cover as he fights at a distance.

### Treasure
Holy vestments hang on hooks throughout. They are covered in the same sigils as those on the walls and tubs. If worn, the vestments grant a **+2 on saving throws against evil creatures**.

### Scaling

## A103: The Long-Forgotten Chapel

The two doors along the southern wall are closed. When the PCs stand in the northern portion of the chapel, shrieking noises echo from the east.

The secret door to the west is a one-way secret door that can only be opened from inside Room A103. The door cannot be pulled open from the other side. Unlike standard secret doors, this door is hinged on one side and requires less effort to open via a **DC 12 Strength** check. It is also fairly noticeable from the inside. When fully open, the door provides 4 feet of space, enough for a Medium creature in armor to pass through. The doors at the southern end are closed.

Large plain pillars that reach to the ceiling sit every ten feet in this room. A swirling oblong vortex of black and red sits against the northern wall, pulsing with eldritch energy. A handful of the flying octopi lie on the floor, obviously charred and eviscerated.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
This is the chapel that Longtail sought after. All adornments and decorations were removed when the chapel was abandoned and neglected by practitioners centuries ago. A few etchings on the wall indicate the place was once dedicated to a god of distance, of doorways, and of forgotten parents. The dead fiendish darkmantles were killed by Longtail.

The swirling vortex is the gateway to an extradimensional pocket — a minor hell chiefly reserved for hunters and incompetent dungeoneers (hence the preponderance of vicious animals). Initially considered a minor nuisance, the fiendish beasts were kept trapped inside this room. That pocket ruptured when the earthquake happened, and this part of the prison was abandoned.

It was Achsyyx who realized that a human hand was needed to dispel the magic on the griffon-shaped lock that still held some magic on the gateway. Without Longtail, the fiendish creatures would have to wait hundreds more years.

And Achsyyx had grown impatient.

As Longtail's familiar, Achsyyx knew it could feed the wererat any lie that led to power. And gifting Longtail a ring the imp claimed to find, the evil, greedy tendencies of the wererat amplified. He sought out the chapel, thinking it was his idea, and used rituals found in his stolen tome. Once he opened the gateway, Longtail realized what he'd done. With the lock removed, the pocket was opened. And many of Longtail's army died.

Achsyyx's plans fell together so perfectly that Longtail still hasn't realized he's been duped. He still believes the imp is a victim in this as well.

Although the chapel appears empty when the PCs arrive, it is not. An invisible Achsyyx keeps an eye out on the gateway at all times. And unless the PCs can go undetected, the imp notes the PCs' presence. It may or may not empathically communicate this to Longtail (GM's choice).

However, neither Longtail nor Achsyyx knows who the PCs are. Or why they are here. A few adventurers have stumbled into the prison lately. The PCs could be anyone. This is especially problematic if the GM is not using the Longtail storyline provided at the front.

**Note:** It is possible the PCs have already encountered Longtail. If so, Achsyyx may not be here but has joined the fight in Room A101.

Roughly twice a day, the holy magic that once flooded the chapel returns for a moment. An illusion of what the room once looked like super-imposes upon the chapel, giving the impression the vortex is gone and all of the pews remain. This is temporary, however. The chapel always returns to this present state.

The gateway itself is an opaque, swirling, less powerful (but permanent) version of the **gate** spell. It is strictly a doorway that only allows travel between the extradimensional pocket and cannot be used to call forth specific creatures. It is up to the GM whether the gateway allows travel in both directions (thus allowing the PCs to go into it) or whether it only allows one-way travel (suggested).

Once opened, the gateway remains open until closed. Since each group of PCs' abilities and resources are different, a number of ways to close the gateway are listed below.

#### Closing the Gateway

- A successful **DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion)** check by a divine or arcane spellcaster can be used to close the gate. Each successful check reduces the gateway by one quarter (meaning that it takes four successful checks to fully close the gateway). This closure restricts the size of creatures that can come through the gateway. At its current fully open state, a creature of up to Large size can come through. Each reduction diminishes the size of the creature that can come through by one size category so that if the gate is 1/4 closed, a Medium or smaller creature can come through. ½ closed allows a small or smaller creature to come through. 3/4 closed allows a Tiny or smaller creature to come through. This same process can also be used to reopen the gateway, setting up a potential duel of Religion/Arcana checks between Longtail and/or Achsyyx against the PCs.

- A successful casting of a **dispel magic** spell, accompanied by a successful **DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion)** check, closes the gateway completely and permanently.

- Using the ritual book for any of these activities provides advantage to die rolls but increases casting time to 10 or 15 minutes.

- If the PCs have already found the book (in Room A104), they may have had time to study and read about the gateway/pocket. Grant them one advantage to any two rolls made in relation to the gateway, especially if they specifically address this action.

- The passage of a creature of the Prime Material plane through the gateway forces it shut (but the creature is trapped within the pocket). A fiendish rat will not work, but a regular rat would.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
Achsyyx is a coward at heart but a thrall to the powers inside the pocket. He keeps the gate open, even if it costs his life (as he fears the final creature inside). It prefers to have Longtail do any dirty work but only summons his master if the PCs seem overly interested in the gate.

PCs dragging their feet too long in this room watch as a pair of fiendish ax beaks stumble out of the gate.

If the PCs have figured out how to close the gateway and begin doing so before Longtail arrives, Achsyyx interferes. Staying invisible, then swooping in to use his stinger, and then turning invisible again is his favorite tactic. If he deems it advantageous, he also uses **suggestion** to distract one of the PCs. Achsyyx certainly relays the information to Longtail, who arrives in due course.

Once Longtail joins the battle (see Room A104), Achsyyx keeps itself out of danger, using his powers at a distance or not at all. He concentrates on keeping the gateway open rather than helping Longtail. If given a choice between the gateway and his master, Achsyyx chooses the gateway every time.

Once the gateway is closed, it disappears from view. Whether it is permanently destroyed or just hiding invisibly once again is up to the GM.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
- **To increase the challenge:** Have two fiendish ax beaks already outside of the gate, with two more arriving a minute later.
- **To decrease the challenge:** Achsyyx's invisibility does not work until Longtail arrives.

## A104: Longtail's Private Room

The door to this room is open.

The far wall is smeared with tar or black ink. It is difficult to tell at this distance. A small bedroll, some caltrops, a backpack, and a continual flame candle holder are the only furnishings in this otherwise cheerless room.

After the PCs enter the room, read the following:

On the floor, a few books lay scattered, as though someone was deep in reading while also angry. Some of the books are torn. One is bound in leather, and one has black paint smeared across the open pages. It looks as though someone was living here, but not anymore.

**Note:** It is possible to find Longtail here, but it is highly unlikely. He has since moved to Room A101 and Room A102 since the owlbear (Room A100) appeared. He is holding up there behind a locked door. If the PCs deal with the owlbear and never go to Room A101, Longtail eventually makes his way back here.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
This is Longtail's room. The wererat spends most of his time here after almost being killed by fiendish creatures that swarmed out of the gateway. Longtail is, unsurprisingly, unhappy about the turn of events and searches for a way to control the beasts coming through the gate. So far, he has not found anything.

There are six books altogether, in various conditions. One is torn apart. One is covered in darkmantle ink. One is covered in maddening scribbles. One is a book on medicine and pain (well-worn and well-read). One is Longtail's spellbook (worn), the spells listed in his stat block. Finally, one is the book of rituals stolen from the church in the preamble.

The last book may help them find a solution to dealing with the gateway, should they take time to read it thoroughly and/or ask the GM the right questions while studying it.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
There is a continual flame candle holder, a pair of hardy, human-sized work boots laid next to the bedroll, along with a paring knife. A small stack of books, as well as the ritual tome, lie against his bedroll. He carries his personal magic items.

## A105-A113: Lost Rooms

Rooms 105 through 113 are a series of rooms that can only be reached from the main area by using one of three secret doors. Due to this fact, these rooms escaped the attention of all its inhabitants and remain much as the original builders left them.

Currently, most of the rooms are empty, although several of them still bear magical remnants of their former occupants' flights to freedom. PCs face little danger here as there are few live monsters, and any potential pitfalls are quite obvious, but some traps are difficult to avoid.

Random encounters cannot occur in this section of Region A. Use logic when determining if a room in this section is safe to rest in.

---

## A105: Forgotten Room

The door to this room is locked and trapped. It is very clearly a trap, as PCs can see the runes, glyphs, and sigils emblazoned all over the door. The trap is not subtle.

The lock is a massive padlock with chains, clearly holding something inside. Several bolts and latches hold the door closed on this side. It looks ancient and undisturbed.

Should any PC touch the door before disarming the magical trap, the door releases **2d6 fire damage** and **2d6 lightning damage** throughout the entire L-shaped hallway outside the room. **Dexterity save for half damage (DC 14)**. Once triggered, the trap does reset in 24 hours.

Disarming the trap requires a **dispel magic** or similar spell.

Unlocking the lock is a simple **DC 16 Dexterity check (Thieves' Tools)**. If the check fails by more than 5 (11 or less), the original trap is triggered (again), even if it has not reset yet. Opening the lock and undoing the latches takes time and makes noise. There is no way to surprise the occupants.

The demons, however, have still been unable to escape the room. Seems unnecessary when phrased like this because, obviously, they are there. Despite escaping from the glass cube, the demons have been unable to bypass the cell's other defensive measures until now.

**Note:** This is a complicated encounter. The inhabitants cannot escape from the inside, but once the PCs open the door, they can mount an escape.

Read the following text once the door is opened.

As the door opens, the presence of evil is overwhelming. A harsh red light seems to come from nowhere, bathing the room in vaguely evil shadows. Heat clings to your exposed skin, and an acrid smell assaults your nostrils.

The ceiling is extremely tall, and the floor is covered in broken glass. Three demonic beasts lurch around the room, pacing impatiently. They puff their chests and turn to face you as the door opens.

If you believe there is time for the PCs to notice, read the following text.

The hunched skeleton of something improbably large rests on a heavy stool against a stove furnace contraption at the corner. On the top of the stove are two short glass jars. One appears to hold something obscured and blurry. The other is filled with roiling blood.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
This room was once a prison cell for powerful demons, who still remain. But its purpose was long forgotten, even before the earthquakes. Its inhabitants have had a long time to foment hatred and plan their escape. They have no idea what exists beyond the door but still intend to escape, given a chance.

The heat is not hot enough to cause damage, but it is uncomfortable and results in **exhaustion (level 1)** at the end of round 4 of combat, which becomes **exhaustion (level 2)** after the fight is over.

Three **dretches** have been held captive here for centuries alongside a **quasit** (disguised as a bat hanging from the ceiling). There are also two jars holding two distinct creatures. See below. Everyone was once held inside a glass cube, but it has since broken open. The demons, however, have still been unable to escape the room.

One of the dretches holds a **unicorn horn** in its hand. The other has a femur from a creature the PCs have never seen before. The last wears a brass collar.

If the unicorn horn breaks, the spell **wither and bloom** is triggered, affecting everyone in the room. The dretch knows this and may attempt to break it as a tactic. This requires a **DC 18 Strength** check, however.

The brass collar once had a **hold monster** spell placed on it. The magic has since faded. But sometimes, the collar shocks the dretch per the **shocking grasp** spell. See tactics.

The large skeleton is the remains of a guardian that died centuries ago. The original prison guards simply forgot about him, and the evil in this room made the flesh wither off its body.

One of the jars contains a tiny but powerful demon. The second jar contains sentient, evil blood. The demon can animate the skeleton and use it to get around, but is presently on top of the stove as a vantage point to survey the room. The sentient blood (Gligg) is a complicated foe.

Both jars are indestructible while in this prison room. Should the bottle demon in the first jar be carried out of the room, it attempts to break itself out. The jar is still extremely resilient (AC 20, 20 hp), and the demon, being unable to generate any momentum given that it fully occupying the jar, makes all its attacks at disadvantage. Nevertheless, if the characters simply stick the jar in a rucksack and forget about it, the GM should roll an attack every minute or so. It's a great way to terrify the players at the table, and, should the demon break out, it might make the next stop for a short or long rest very entertaining.

Gligg is another matter altogether. Even among the demons in this room, Gligg is hated. It is an anomaly in the dungeon and in the fabric of reality itself, and its presence is a mystery. Where it came from and why it is imprisoned with demons is utterly obscure. A **DC 14 Wisdom (Insight)** check reveals to the characters Gligg was kept here because it couldn't otherwise be kept or destroyed.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
The fight starts almost instantly. The pair of dretches have already released their fetid clouds, so the PCs must make saving throws as soon as the door opens.

The dretches roll initiative together. Everyone else rolls their own initiative. Gligg goes on a '1.'

**Round 1:**
- The dretches use the weapons in their hands, bashing and stabbing with rage. They gain advantage on this opening attack and deal an additional +2 damage should they successfully hit.
- Meanwhile, while disguised as a bat, the quasit uses its **Scare** ability on the first PC through the door.

**Round 2:**
- The dretches dogpile on a single opponent, using their multi-attack to subdue an enemy quickly. They push back the PCs if possible. They regenerate three hit points each if they have suffered any damage.
- The quasit goes invisible and does not become visible again. Instead, it waits for an opportunity to fly out of the room and escape. If you handle the encounter properly, the PCs may have never noticed the quasit (bat).

**Round 3:**
- The large skeleton resting against the furnace animates and grabs the bottle demon jar from the top of the stove while simultaneously grabbing the stool to use as a bashing weapon.
- The dretches regenerate three hit points each if they are still alive.
- If the third dretch is still up, the **shocking grasp** spell triggers on its collar, dealing 3 points of damage.
- Gligg casts **darkness** into the eyes of one of the PCs.

**Round 4:**
- The skeleton faces off against the closest PC while the bottle demon casts **death ward** on the skeleton.
- If any of the dretches are still up, they flank (if possible) and continue attacking.
- Gligg casts **guidance** on the skeleton.

**Round 5:**
- The bottle demon casts **haste** on the skeleton and then **magic missile** on all subsequent rounds. Unless a PC gets within 5 feet of it, in which case the bottle demon uses its bottle throw ability.
- The skeleton pushes forward if it can.
- Gligg casts **slow** on the nearest PC.

After that, the fight continues normally if anyone is left standing. The bottle demon can cast **magic missile** two more times.

The skeleton is too large to get through the doorway. But its objective is to get the jar out of the room. As soon as it can get to the doorway, or as close as possible, it tosses the jar over the heads of the PCs. From there, the invisible quasit can grab the jar and fly away (as a bat). The quasit remains invisible when it picks up the jar.

If the bottle demon gets out of the room, Gligg turns on its cohorts, casting **confusion** and **sleep** on everyone (on alternating rounds).

It is possible, the PCs will try to draw the fight out of the room. This is perfectly fine. The skeleton has no need/desire to escape, but the others do. If the PCs give the demons space to operate, the dretches work to get the bottle demon out (knowing it will come back from them, eventually).

**Note:** While in this room, all of the enemies gain advantage on resistance rolls of any kind (saves, etc.). They have been here a long time. Their will is strong. Whatever good energy existed here has turned villainous.

After the fight is over, read the following.

The heat is unbearable. You take a moment to gather your senses and sit. Your shoulders ache, and your mind is overcome with thoughts of villainy. This room is evil. While there is probably much to explore here, the oppressiveness of the room is noticeable. Long breath. But there's another problem before you. What to do with this jar?

#### Aftermath: The Jars

The bottle demon may or may not still be alive after the fight. If it died in the fight, so be it. There is nothing for the GM to track. However, if the bottle demon does survive, the PCs have a choice to make. Do they put it back in the room or take it with them? The situation with Gligg is similar...

**Gligg:** Gligg cannot be destroyed, but it can be reasoned with. It has no voice but communicates in Abyssal through telepathy. It can also speak its native tongue, which is some ancient language from before elves and giants. GMs are encouraged to make it something weird. Maybe Gligg is a primordial githyanki. Gligg might learn common slowly, through association with the PCs.

Gligg is very intelligent but might pretend to be stupid while discerning who these adventurers are. It might help the PCs with its limited powers. If so, someone must carry the jar. It is beyond evil, so just holding it will, over time, corrupt the PC. Even if the PCs trade off duties, Gligg's evil will slowly affect them all. It might also read the minds of the PCs and, slowly over time, feed their wants and needs, making things happen in one character's favor over the others. Turning people against one another is what he does best. Give Gligg any high-level enchantment spells you want it to have.

But his powers can prove useful. The GM is encouraged to mix up what Gligg can do from time to time. The PCs can't see? Gligg casts **continual flame** on someone's clothing. The PCs are being overwhelmed? Gligg casts **mage armor** and **shield** on the person holding the jar. The first time he casts **magic missile**, only one comes out. The second time, maybe three. Gligg will certainly tempt the PCs to use his power more and more until he turns the power off at the worst moment.

The PCs will probably try to drink Gligg. Some of him, at least. He does not come apart that way. He is a near-solid and cannot be cut. Therefore, if consumed, Gligg can be a powerful poison or a strong elixir. Inside someone's body, it is even more powerful. The jar no longer holds it and being eternal, Gligg can just wait out the PC who drank it.

Alternatively, the PCs can just leave the jars here and lock the door on their way out.

**The Quasit:** If the quasit escapes, it makes its way through the dungeon invisibly, as best as it can. It will eventually find someone to ally with and help them resist and/or escape. Because of the location of Room A105, it can either head to Region B (if the doors are open) or north to link up with surviving humanoids. This is left open for the GM to coordinate.

### Treasure
The skeleton wears a golden necklace with a thick chain and an amulet with a holy symbol on it, now tarnished and brown. The edges are rusted. It radiates powerful evil and abjuration magic. Treat it as **+1 resistance**, should a PC wear it, but the evil cannot be easily removed from the item. This may eventually lead to a curse and could be a future quest, should the PCs survive.

The shattered glass covering the floor can be used as a magical component in any kind of **banishment** or **binding** spell. It replaces the standard material components of that spell. The PCs can collect roughly two dozen 'doses' of the glass if they spend an hour gathering the glass into a container.

### Scaling
- **To increase the challenge:** Add two more dretches.
- **To decrease the challenge:** The skeleton animates starting on Round 4.

## A106: Thunder Cell

Drawn on the door to this room is the Celestial rune for 'thunder.' A **DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)** check is required to translate the rune. The door to this room is locked, requiring a **DC 18 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)** check or an arcane spellcaster to touch the door with a lightning-based or wind-based spell.

A blast of air expels from the room with force as the door opens, pushing you to the ground. The room contains a strange, elongated desk. There is also a large bronze plate in the center of the floor.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The rune on the floor is the same as the one on the door. If any lawful or good PC stands on the plate, thunder and a blast of air erupts from the floor (for 1 full minute), but it does not hurt. Instead, it cleanses the PC of all poisons, ability score damage, and heals **3d8+3 points of damage**.

In addition, so long as the PC is lawful good character remains on the plate for the full minute, he gains temporary (**1d20 days**) resistance to fire damage.

If a chaotic or evil PC stands on the plate, he suffers **3d8+3 electrical damage** and gains one level of exhaustion. If a PC is both chaotic AND evil, he suffers this damage twice. This is pure arcane electricity that bypasses electricity resistance but not spell resistance.

Chaotic good and lawful evil characters gain/lose nothing from this thunder.

### Encounter Condition
Fear 14, Hallowed 2, Safe

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
Inside the desk are numerous drawers, doors, and cubby holes. The GM is encouraged to make the process of opening and sliding doors complicated, like an intricate puzzle box. This drawer slides open, and a button is revealed, which makes a previously locked drawer openable. You get the idea.

Five scrolls (all penned in different hands) are tucked away in different places. Each is written in a different language, giving wizards a project to decipher them all.

The scrolls contain the following spells:

- **magic weapon** and **nondetection**
- **protection from good and evil**, **silence**, and **hold person**
- **disguise self** and **phantom steed**
- **protection from energy**, **invisibility**, and **levitate**
- **shield** and **spider climb**

## A107: Holding Pens

Small cells, barely large enough to fit a person comfortably, line the length of this room. Empty shackles hang from the wall, magically electrical energy crackling from them.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This room was once used to hold smaller and less troublesome demons and devils. Usually, demons and devils were forced to face each other, knowing their ideological differences would drive the two mad and make escape attempts less likely–and if the creatures did manage to get free, they'd be more inclined to kill one another than break out of the prison. The shackles act as **dimensional shackles** with **hold monster (DC 18)** cast on them.

### Encounter Condition
Haunted, Negative Energy, Safe

### Tactics
If the PCs want to remove the shackles from the wall, they must first succeed at a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or be held per **hold monster**. Then, they must succeed at a **DC 22 Strength (Athletics)** check. If both are successful, one pair of shackles is ripped from the wall. Spell resistance does not work against these shackles.

PCs that remain in this room for too long begin to feel the unnerving energy of the demons who spent centuries here. Their aura has permeated the rock and made the room unlivable. PCs wishing to rest here get no sleep but avoid the rigors of the dungeon.

PCs that attempt to rest here are overcome with nightmarish visions of demon creatures being shackled and caged, tearing their own limbs off, or growing new mouths in order to bite out their own throats. Upon waking, characters suffer **1d4 Wisdom damage** and **exhaustion (level 1)** instead of gaining the benefit of rest. They also begin to sweat blood for the next 24 hours, making any interpersonal checks at disadvantage as a result.

Feel free to describe the nightmares however you wish. Throw in some sweating blood, and so on.

## A108: Cold Cell

Drawn on the door to this room is the Celestial rune for 'water.' A **DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)** check is required to translate the rune. The door to this room is locked, requiring a **DC 18 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)** check or an arcane spellcaster to touch the door with a cold-based spell.

A blast of cold air expels from the room as the door opens. The floor, recessed, holds water about 4 or 5 feet deep. Ice has formed along the walls, and mist hangs just over the lip of the water.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The rune on the floor is the same as the one on the door. If any lawful or good PC stands on the plate, cold and ice erupts from the floor (for 1 full minute), but it does not hurt. Instead, it cleanses the PC of all poisons, ability score damage, and heals **3d8+3 points of damage**.

In addition, so long as the PC is lawful good and remains on the plate for the full minute, he gains temporary (**1d20 days**) resistance to cold damage.

If a chaotic or evil PC stands on the plate, he suffers **3d8+3 electrical damage** and gains one level of exhaustion. If a PC is both chaotic AND evil, he suffers this damage twice. This is pure arcane cold that bypasses cold resistance but not spell resistance.

Chaotic good and lawful evil characters gain/lose nothing from this cold.

### Encounter Condition
Extreme Cold, Flooded

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
If the PCs search the water, allow a **DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)** check to find **pipes of haunting** that have become waterlogged. Three castings of **mending** restore the pipes.

## A109: Foggy Room

A thick ankle-high gray fog covers the entire floor. Occasional bright flashes within the fog are followed by a crackling sound. Stone statues, three in all, stand at the corners, billowing fog from their agape mouths. The statues are unique, even in size, pose, and gender. Their faces permanently are etched in horror. A strange gurgling noise fills the air.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This fog is the result of magical, gurgling energies released from the broken mouths of three stoney victims, placed here and punished by the guardians. All of the statues were once evil humans from an ancient empire, now turned to stone. These three were cruel kings and queens, punished for their sins centuries ago.

- **King Huthor,** who slew 1,000 of his own people as a display of his power. He is in the NW corner, facing the center of the room.

- **Queen Osilith** who encouraged her king husband to do it. She is in the NE corner, her head twisted to face south.

- **Prince Ferric, 'the Debauched,'** a scion of an ancient and now forgotten house who spent his entire fortune in the pursuit of ever greater highs, eventually beginning to poison the food and water supplies of his people for the thrill of watching them sicken and die, never understanding why. He is in the Southwest corner. His body points toward the center of the room, but his head is twisted completely around, facing the corner.

The PCs may not see it from across the room, but scores of fiendish beetles pour from the eyes of the statues. When they fall into the fog, they scream in agony as they die and dissipate into more fog. It is an unending cycle.

The hands of the statues face outward or are upturned in unique poses. Etched into the stone of each statue are lash marks as though they had been whipped.

The fog covers the entire floor of the room except for the first square to the west of the doorway. The fog is perfectly stationary and does not spill out into the hallway.

The bright flashes and crackling are the result of the electrical charge that the fog bears (if the GM wants to make it more obvious, have occasional arcs of electricity race across the top of the fog). Any creature moving through the fog takes **1 point of damage per round** due to the electrical discharges (**2 points of damage per round** if wearing metal armor or otherwise carrying a lot of metal).

Those who cross the room to examine the statues suffer damage along the way. There is nothing to be discerned by looking at them. They are ancient, elusive figures from a kingdom the PCs have never heard of. Touching a statue's hand(s) is another story.

Each one imparts a story. The PC's mind is flooded with images of past trauma, torture, and blood — both by the sinners and their victims. These three were certainly punished for their transgressions. Once a hand is touched, it cannot be let go of for a full minute, as the pain transfers from the statue to the PC. The damage, however, takes the form of knowledge.

Once the full minute is over, during which time the PC does not suffer electrical damage, the PC gains **1 point of Intelligence** but loses **one point of Charisma**. Seeing this horror imparts knowledge but strains empathy. The PC is also **exhausted (level 2)** by this experience.

Each PC can touch only one statue but may not want to after they see what it has done to another PC.

### Encounter Condition
Fog 5, Poor Footing 2

### Tactics
Do not immediately tell the PC they have lost Charisma and gained Intelligence. Instead, wait until after their next long rest.

Clerics may attempt to absolve the sinners. This may require the expenditure of a spell, an appropriate channel divinity, or perhaps hit points. GMs are encouraged to make the cost match the story so far or the crimes committed by the individuals depicted in the statues.

### Treasure

### Scaling
- **To increase the challenge:** Increase the damage of the fog by 1.
- **To decrease the challenge:** Reduce the damage of the fog to 1 or 2 damage per two rounds.
