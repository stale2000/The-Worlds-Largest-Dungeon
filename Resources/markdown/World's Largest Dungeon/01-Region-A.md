STOP!
If you still need to read the introduction, do so now. 
You must understand the foundation of the dungeon 
to run this adventure. Details on lighting, doors, and 
so on all explain how to run this adventure.
LONGTAIL
Longtail is a wererat sorcerer with a quick mind, cha-
risma, and grand ambitions. With research and the 
aid of his imp familiar Achsyyx, Longtail uncovered 
some of the secrets of the dungeons, its history, and 
their original purpose.
Through Achsyyx’s ability to commune with the 
infernal powers, he learned that there was a long-for-
gotten chapel close to the dungeon entrance that 
held a gateway to an extradimensional space where 
multitudes of infernal beasts had been trapped. 
According to Achsyyx, releasing those beasts would 
make the wererat their master and grant him a fero-
cious army. Longtail’s destiny was clear.
Longtail’s endless charm allowed him to bring 
together a diverse force of humanoids to accompany 
him on his quest. Gathered from the disaffected 
elements of half a dozen tribes; kobolds, troglodytes, 
orcs, and even an ogre rallied to his side.
Fueled by the promise of treasure and led by liz-
ardfolk guides, Longtail’s forces made their way to 
the dungeon in short order. Entering the long-lost 
entrance, they began exploring the area searching 
for the tomb’s fabled wealth. Longtail himself, guid-
ed by Achsyyx, led a small expedition into the far-
thest reaches.
At first, empty-handed, the humanoids were 
eager to exploit their new home, greeting Long-
tail’s absence as a chance to gather as much trea-
sure as possible. But as party after party came back 

29
empty-handed and with tales of barren rooms filled 
with nothing but traps, trouble ensued.
Longtail’s natural leadership had held the unusu-
al force together. Soon, however, natural rivalries 
began to assert themselves. Insults and slights led to 
shouting and infighting, and suspicions and rumors 
of unshared loot led to bitter accusations. 
Inevitably, an armed confrontation took place, and 
Longtail’s force was splintered in two. The reptilians, 
composed of the kobolds, troglodytes, and lizardfolk, 
banded together against the more numerous orcs 
and their ogre enforcer.
The dungeon was divided, each side looking for 
treasure they would never find. After fruitless days, 
both sides became convinced that the other side had 
found something. Soon, spying gave way to battle as 
the two factions fought across the length and breadth 
of the area. In a short time, they forgot about trea-
sure, concerned only with wiping out their enemies.
Whatever magic once existed in the prison-dun-
geon to keep hostilities squashed had evaporated. 
The dungeon was now fomenting with dissent and 
hate. Something Achsyyx either didn’t understand 
or didn’t plan for. And now, Longtail’s quest was a 
side note in the scuffle; some even forgot about the 
half-fiend.
They would soon be reminded.
Even as the humanoids fought amongst them-
selves, Longtail led his expedition to the forgotten 
chapel. There, with the aid of his familiar Achsyyx, he 
opened the gateway. 
Things did not go as planned. A wave of extraplanar 
beasts, driven by hatred, rushed through the gate-
way and into the dungeon. Falling on the fighting 
humanoids, the beasts struck a hammer blow that 
filled the dungeon with the blood and the screams of 
Longtail’s erstwhile allies. As Longtail tried desper-
ately to gain control, Achsyyx and the infernal pow-
ers smiled.
Random Encounters
The release of the extraplanar beasts has thrown this 
entire Region into chaos. Whereas before, there were 
clear areas under the influence of a particular group 
of humanoids, the resulting chaos means that there 
are no longer any actual areas of control. Between the 
hunting beasts and the scared, lost humanoids, there 
is plenty of motion and confusion in this dungeon. As 
a result, a party traveling through this Region is just 
as likely to encounter a reptilian as they are an orc or 
an extraplanar beast.
Rather than checking at some specific time interval 
for random encounters, the GM should use this table 
whenever they deem appropriate. Remember that 
despite the number of Rooms in this Region, there is 
not a lot of distance between most Rooms and areas 
and sound carries well in such an environment. If the 
action is slow — for instance, the PCs are taking their 
time searching through the rubble in a Room or are 
being extra cautious as they move down a hall — the 
events from this table will liven things up.
Another way to use the chart is to add a random 
element to the encounters described in the various 
Rooms. Many of the listed random encounters add 
an interesting twist to the otherwise standard com-
bat scenarios inevitable in a dungeon of this size. 
After all, the noise of combat is bound to attract 
some interest.
A final option for this table is if the PCs return to 
areas or Rooms where they have already been. Since 
the dungeon is in constant flux, it is likely that some-
thing other than the original inhabitants now occupy 
the Room. A particularly bold GM could use this 
table to add the occasional encounter to an otherwise 
empty Room.
Additional suggestions. Roll a random encounter:
 
Whenever the PCs spend too much time in one 
place
 
Whenever the PCs do something noisy 
 
Whenever the PCs rest with any sort of food or 
fire in a non-safe room

D20encounter
1
A loud, guttural scream echoes in the 
distance. When rolled again, the sound 
becomes more guttural. Include the sounds 
of blood and phlegm if you like.
2
A dead kobold or orc lies in the hallway, 
recently murdered. When rolled again, a 
pair of bodies are discovered and, this time, 
mutilated in addition to murder.
3-8
Nothing. When rolled again, add +1 to the 
roll. This bonus is cumulative.
9
Two fiendish snake swarms slither the 
dungeon corridors in search of a meal. 
When rolled again, make the swarm carriers 
of disease.
10
Four fiendish stirges, tired of the offal in 
this dungeon, seek the blood of something 
warm. When rolled again, there are 
three additional stirges, now carrying a 
contagious disease.
11
A fiendish rat swarm charges toward 
the PCs, fleeing from something in the 
darkness. They spend one round moving 
past the PCs, dealing damage as they 
go. When rolled again, the swarm deals 
double damage.
12
A pack of six fiendish dire rats digs its way 
out of a crack in the wall and proceeds to 
stalk the PCs. When rolled again, there are 
five additional rats, and then they gain a +5 
circumstance bonus to ambush.
13
A patrol of eight kobold warriors or four 
orc warriors meanders, looking for a place 
to rest in the hopes of avoiding work. They 
only fight the PCs if no other option is 
available. When rolled again, the patrol size 
doubles and is more likely to engage.
14
Four lost/confused troglodytes shout at 
one another, arguing about directions 
and the futility of this endeavor. GMs are 
encouraged to develop this argument 
further. When rolled again, this encounter 
becomes three orcs beating up a pair of 
troglodytes.
15
A krenshar and its kobold rider scout the 
halls, returning to Room A69 with news of 
intruders. When rolled again, the krenshar 
has four kobold infantry escorts.
16
A combination of 1d6 various mephits, 
wearing the skin of darkmantles pry their 
little fingers into the stone walls, to no avail.  
When rolled again, increase the number of 
mephits to 2d4+1.
17
Minor tremor. Dust falls from the ceiling, 
obscuring vision throughout the entire 
Region. All sight, including darkvision, is 
limited to 5 ft. Creatures within 5 ft. are 
lightly obscured, while creatures farther 
away are heavily obscured. Dust remains 
for 1 round. When rolled again, the dust 
remains for 1d3+1 rounds.
18
Tremor. As minor tremor, except creatures 
in the entire Region must succeed at a DC 
10 Dexterity save or fall prone. Dust remains 
for 1d4+1 rounds. When rolled again, the 
dust remains for 1d6+2 rounds.
19
Major tremor. As tremor, except creatures 
in the entire Region must succeed at a DC 
12 Dexterity save or fall prone. All creatures 
suffer 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage 
from the rocks. Dust remains for 2d4+2 
rounds. When rolled again, increase all 
numeric values by 2.
20
Roll twice on this table, ignoring any further 
rolls of 19+.
A1 . ENTRANCE 
This is the last chance the PCs have to rest and reflect 
before entering the dungeon. Nothing else enters it 
as long as the PCs are in the entrance chamber. An 
inspection of the passageway as it approaches the 
‘barrier’ reveals that it is absolutely featureless, devoid 
of markings, symbols, or even any sign of use.
As you move through the passageway, the edge of 
the tunnel disappears into a blackness that lies just 
beyond. It is not a wall barring entry but an inde-
scribable void. Darkness and light meet in a perfect 
duality. Peering cautiously into the darkness for 
signs of movement, you see none. There is a still-
ness in the air. No breeze in front of you. Nothing. 
Your ears detect only the breathing of your fellow 

31
adventurers. The darkness betrays nothing of what 
lies beyond.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The passageway ends in an opaque 
magical field. This field prevents all vision, includ-
ing darkvision, as well as all sound from passing 
through from one side to the other in either direc-
tion. In addition, the magical field has an unusual 
and permanent force effect that allows creatures 
and items to enter the dungeon without difficulty 
but absolutely prevents them from leaving.
Opaque Door Barrier: Permanent, one-way wall of 
force. Cannot be dispelled or disintegrated, and no 
sound can pass through it.
If the PCs want to enter the dungeon, they 
simply must take that leap of faith and step beyond 
the door. Cautious PCs may stick only a hand or an 
object through, but they find that when they try to 
withdraw the hand or object, they cannot because 
the barrier prevents the return movement. No 
amount of pulling brings the hand or object back 
through the barrier, although if enough force is 
used, the object could undoubtedly be broken or 
the hand severed.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: Subtly encourage the PCs to prepare them-
selves by healing, resting, and readying equipment 
and weapons, etc., prior to having them enter the 
dungeon if they need it. Nothing bothers them as 
long as they are in this Room, and they can take all 
the time they need to make sure they are in tip-
top shape. 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
do not indicate a barrier has been passed. Simply 
let the PCs walk through an invisible force field 
unknowingly. To decrease the challenge of this 
encounter, give the PCs a hint that this barrier is 
one-way, or simply ignore this effect completely. 
Allow the PCs to come and go as they please. This 
eliminates a lot of the dread of the dungeon but 
does give back one more gaming option to players 
who demand complete agency.
A2-A20 . ORC STRONGHOLD
Rooms A2 through A20 make up the former orc 
stronghold within this Region. The orcs chose the 
area closest to the entrance for defensive reasons and 
launched all of their search expeditions from here. 
While this portion of the dungeon is defensively 
strong, these same qualities limit the ability of the 
orcs to explore the other parts of the dungeon.
As the conflict with the reptilians escalated, the 
orcs’ leader, a barbarian named Orghar, decided that 
it was time to force a decision. Marshaling the orcs, 
he led them in an all-or-nothing assault on the reptil-
ians throughout the dungeon.
Since launching the attack, the orcs have aban-
doned this section. Although they planned to return 
and establish a garrison to guard the entrance once 
they were victorious, none returned. Various groups 
established themselves throughout the Region but 
have been displaced since.
A2 . THE FIRST ROOM 
Your torchlight gleams feebly in the complete 
gloom, lighting up a small section of the room. 
Barely glinting in the torchlight, two iron doors, 
one straight ahead of you and the other to the side, 
are the only things visible in the walls of worked 
stone. The chill and damp clings to your body. 
You are not the only one feeling it, judging by the 
coughs coming from the darkness.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly 
Encounter: Three orc warriors sit huddled together 
in the northeastern corner of this Room. They are 
battered remnants of the orcs who followed Longtail 
into the dungeon. There could be others. Somewhere. 
They look exhausted, and their scar-marked faces are 
ashen and pale. Infected wounds are evident, as well 
as bruises and blood stains from weeks of fighting. 
One has an eye full of pus. Another is missing teeth 

 32
and spits blood into a rusted cup. One orc attempts to 
stifle a lingering, persistent cough.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The orcs are fatigued from their recent expe-
riences. Each orc suffers from one level of exhaus-
tion. They are not looking for a fight and will only 
attack if the PCs attack them first. The PCs are free 
to move about the Room — the orcs only watch 
listlessly. Even if elves or dwarves are with the party, 
the orcs do no more than half-heartedly bare their 
teeth in an empty threat.
Any PC succeeding at a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) 
check realizes the orcs have simply given up and 
are waiting for the inevitable. If the PCs ask the orcs 
about what happened to them, the largest of the 
three appears to ponder the question for a moment 
and then says “You will see soon enough” in broken 
Common. The other two laugh at the response, 
the smallest one stifling his cough. The orcs ignore 
any further questions, answering with half-hearted, 
surly glances.
Any acts of intimidation, bluffing, or diploma-
cy fail on these tired warriors, and no amount of 
promises, threats, or bribes gets them to care about 
anyone or anything. No matter what, the orcs do 
not accompany or aid the PCs in any way. They 
make their final stand in this Room.
If a fight ensues, the orcs do what they can to 
defend themselves, but their fatigue and defeatist 
attitude work against them at this point. They em-
ploy no tactics other than a straightforward attack.
If the PCs return to this Room later (at least an 
hour or so has passed), the three orcs are dead, killed 
by fiendish darkmantles.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two more orcs. To decrease the challenge, have 
the orcs be exhausted (move at half speed, –6 pen-
alty to Strength and Dexterity).
A3 . BODY STORAGE 
Even before the door opens, you smell something 
amiss. As it swings open, the stench from within 
is overwhelming. The source is more than a score 
of bodies in a pile, their flesh rotting away. Some 
chunks hang on hooks, while a barrel filled with 
harvested organs stews in the center of the room. 
On the northern wall, a makeshift shelf, warped by 
too much blood and sagging from the weight of 
severed arms and legs, is about to collapse.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These bodies are trophies brought back 
by the orcs from their conflicts with the reptili-
ans. There are 23 bodies here, 17 kobolds, and six 
troglodytes in varying states of decay. All of them 
have been stripped of anything they carried in life. 
Examination of the bodies shows their wounds were 
caused by sharp-edged weapons.
If the PCs move around the room, they most 
certainly kick over a jar of preserved eyes that lies in 
the darkness. However it is possible to spot it with a 
Wisdom check (DC 16) before that happens. Whoev-
er left this has a sick sense of trophy-hunting.
The smell of decay is strong enough to require a 
DC 12 Constitution saving throw from every living 
creature that enters the Room. Failing the save 
causes the creature to be poisoned for the duration 
of their stay in the Room as well as for 1d4 rounds 
thereafter. Any living creature spending more than 
a single round in the Room is also subject to catch-
ing an airborne variant of filth fever.
Filth Fever: DC 11 Constitution save. On a failure: 
in 1d3 days, Dexterity and Constitution are each 
reduced by 1d4 until the disease is removed. Repeat 
save every 8 hours. Filth Fever ends after three con-
secutive successful DC 11 Constitution saves.
The secret door in the eastern wall is a standard 
secret door (Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15) that 
pivots on a vertical center hinge. The space opened 
by the door is just wide enough for a creature of 
medium size or smaller to pass on either side of the 
door (so up to two medium-size creatures can pass 
through simultaneously).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A kobold liver is mashed and cut up at the 
bottom of the barrel. Inside the liver, someone has 
stored a silver ring. The ring is somehow clean, and 
blood will not cling to it. It’s very large and won’t fit 
a normal-sized human finger, however.
Scaling: N/A

33
A4 . ANTECHAMBER 
The southern door to this Room is trapped with burn-
ing hands. Anytime a Tiny or larger creature touches 
the face of the door, the trap is triggered, shooting 
flames in a 15-ft. cone from the center of the door. 
 '
Burning Hands Trap. 3d6 fire damage. Creatures 
take half damage on a successful DC 10 Dexterity 
saving throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to 
find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. 
Automatically resets after 1 round.
The secret doors in the eastern and western walls are 
standard secret doors. 
Several piles of moldy sacks sit in each of the four 
corners of this room, and their decaying contents 
fill the air with a sour smell. There is a door directly 
across from the one you just opened.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The orc warriors in Room A2 are aware of 
the trap but avoid it. If the trap injures or kills any 
of the PCs while the orcs are in that Room, the orcs 
break out into grins and chuckle amongst them-
selves, claiming ignorance if confronted.
Inside one of the sacks is a troglodyte head, now 
covered in mold and devoid of flesh. The eyes have 
since rotted away or been eaten by bugs. If the PCs 
have not encountered a troglodyte before, the skull 
is a foreign shape to them. Conversely, allow a DC 15 
Wisdom (Nature) check to identify it.
The contents of the other sacks have long since 
rotted. They defy identification. Small gray mush-
rooms and black molds grow on top of the piles. See 
treasure below.
Any PC that disturbs a sack roughly causes the 
mold to burst, releasing its mildly poisonous spores. 
Picking up any sack breaks the bottom, spilling the 
contents on the floor. This also releases spores (obvi-
ously). Eating the mold produces similar results.
 '
Black Mold. If disturbed, a patch of this mold 
bursts forth with a cloud of poisonous spores. 
All living creatures within 10 ft. of the mold must 
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save or suffer 1d4 
points of Constitution damage for 24 hours. The 
only ways to destroy the mold is with fire or to let it 
dry out in a warm, dry climate for 24 hours.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: Since the PCs have survived a trap, they 
most certainly have to pass back through again, 
roll up a random magic item relevant to their level 
and class composition, and hide it amongst the 
moldy sacks.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the burning hands trap to 
6d6 and replace the black mold with yellow mold 
(see Room A84). To decrease the challenge, reduce 
the initial/secondary damage of the black mold to 1 
point of temporary Constitution damage each.
A5 . MAIN STORAGE 
The doors to Rooms A4 and A6 are open.
Rotting barrels, moldy crates, and disintegrating 
sacks with mushrooms embedded in them line the 
left wall of this room, leaving a 5-ft. wide passage-
way along the right wall directly in front of the 
door. The smell of mold and mildew is strong. Black 
mold spiderwebs out from the barrels and up the 
walls. Bloody starfish-shaped marks on the wall 
seem fresh, as though something was just killed 
here. But that isn’t possible. Right?
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Dozens of barrels, crates, and sacks line 
the wall, extending into the western end of the Room. 
They are piled up in a disorganized fashion (to say 
the least), and most of them have been opened (the 
barrels have their tops staved in, the crates’ boards 
torn away, and the sacks ripped open, some of their 
contents spilling onto the ground). 
As in Room A4, the sacks are covered in black mold 
and mushroom colonies. Although the barrels and 
crates are not so afflicted, the items are stacked so 
haphazardly that anyone moving a barrel or crate 
must succeed at a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check 
or release a cloud of spores from one of the sacks 
nearby. Moving a sack causes it to disintegrate, spill-
ing its contents on the floor and releasing the mold 
into the air. 
If the PCs are bold enough to rifle through the 
contents anyway, they find that the barrels contain 
vinegar (still good), the crates contain various rusted 

 34
mining tools (such as picks and shovels), and the con-
tents of the sacks have been lost to the mold.
 '
Black Mold. If disturbed, a patch of this mold 
bursts forth with a cloud of poisonous spores. 
All living creatures within 10 ft. of the mold must 
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save or suffer 1d4 
points of Constitution damage for 24 hours. The 
only ways to destroy the mold is with fire or to let it 
dry out in a warm, dry climate for 24 hours.
The acid arrow trap in the hallway beyond Room A5 
is described in Room A6.
The blood on the wall is from a fiendish darkmantle 
that consumed a fleeing orc. The body is long gone, 
but the blood refuses to dry up. Something about the 
kill remains fresh, though neither the killer nor the 
victim is still here. The PCs can collect this blood into 
a bottle or flask. The blood never congeals or dimin-
ishes in quality. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: A careful search of the Room (DC 15 Wis-
dom (Perception) check) reveals a small gold ring 
(40 gp) and a simple chain (20 sp) resting between 
two barrels. Note that as long as the search does 
not entail actually moving anything, there is no 
chance of releasing the black mold.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of the encounter, 
replace the black mold with yellow mold (see Room 
A84). To decrease the challenge of the encounter, 
reduce the Constitution damage to 1 point or lower 
the save DC to 10.
A6 . TOOL STORAGE 
Coils of rope, barrels with nails, and open crates 
with tools line the walls on makeshift pegs. Al-
though the air is damp, there is no mold on any of 
the items.
Any Tiny or larger creature entering the north/south 
hallway leading to Room A6 triggers an acid arrow 
trap. The proximity trigger covers the space just be-
fore the northern door to Room A6. Any creature who 
remains for more than one minute in the hall resets 
the trap, allowing it to trigger again. 
 '
Acid Arrow Trap. A shimmering green arrow streaks 
towards the target. +4 to hit one target. On a hit, 
4d4 acid damage immediately and another 2d4 at 
the end of the target’s next turn. DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check to find, DC 15 Intelligence (Ar-
cana) check to disarm. Resets after 1 minutes.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: There are five coils of hempen rope to-
taling 500 ft., as well as seven small barrels of rusty 
nails and enough tools to make a total of 10 sets 
of stonemason’s tools (hammers, chisels, etc.). The 
hemp rope has been weakened by the damp air and 
breaks if subjected to holding more than 100 lbs 
of weight.
The secret door in the western wall is a standard 
secret door and is used to bypass the trap in the 
hall. The PCs can open it with a little bit of pressure 
(DC 10 Strength check) once the door is discovered.
Because of the acid arrow trap, this room is not 
safe to rest in. But should the PCs find a way to 
disable it, they can stay here for a while without 
disturbance. Regardless, there is no chance of a 
random encounter here.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There is a 1 in 20 chance one of the tools 
is magical in nature, providing a +2 bonus to skill 
checks while using it.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a 3rd stage of damage to the acid arrow trap for 
another 2d4 acid damage. To decrease the chal-
lenge, reduce the Wisdom check DC by 5.
A7 . FORMER TROGLODYTE 
QUARTERS 
The heavy smell of stale air greets you as you open 
the door to this large room. Dried grass is scattered 
all over the floor as though a tornado recently tore 
through a meadow. Something written in blood 
in a foreign language stands about 3 feet off the 
ground in the northeast corner.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was occupied by a small group 
of troglodytes who treated it much like their former 
cave home; they were among the first of the orcs’ 

35
victims when relations among the humanoids went 
sour. Given their uncivilized nature, they used it not 
only as their sleeping place but for everything else, 
although they kept those activities to the southeast-
ern corner.
The troglodyte stench is eye-wateringly power-
ful, and any living creature that enters the Room 
must succeed at a DC 12 Constitution save or be-
come poisoned for as long as it is in the Room and 
for 1d4 rounds after it leaves the Room. 
The dried grass is composed of reed mat rem-
nants the troglodytes used as sleeping mats, and 
were destroyed during a fight in this Room. A DC 
12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals dried pools of 
blood throughout. 
The troglodytes were unaware of the secret door 
in the middle of the northern wall, as were the 
orcs. The locking mechanism for the door is quite 
simple, but the door is hard to spot. It can only be 
found with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) 
or Intelligence (Investigation) check. Finding and 
pushing the latch does not require a roll once the 
door is found, however.
Troglodytes, who died fighting the orcs, were 
disposed of through various means, including leav-
ing them for the rats to finish off, and using their 
bones as weapons.
The bloody letters are written in draconic. 
“Gristuun was here” is written in an extremely 
crude form.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: Brave characters may search through the 
detritus. On a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) check, they uncover one of the following: 
a necklace made of freshwater shells of various 
sizes on a leather thong (1 gp); a ceremonial bronze 
dagger (5 gp); or a ceramic idol of a creature that is 
a cross between a toad and a lizard (no value).
Scaling: N/A 
A8 . ORC CORPSE 
The floor is covered in debris, and the walls are 
covered with decades of filth. The body of an orc, 
his arm outstretched toward the doorway, lies 
slumped near the middle of the room. The smell of 
decay is oddly absent, and the body has not started 
to rot. A lone spear, its shaft broken, lays in one of 
the corners. Giant holes in the body of the orc, but 
no blood, indicate a strange murder.
The door to Room A2 is closed. The door to Room 
A9 is open.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This orc was a clansman to the orcs in 
Room A2, who they abandoned. Attacked by fiend-
ish darkmantles or stirges, he managed to drag 
himself here in a vain attempt to keep up with his 
clansmen. If the PCs alert the three orcs in Room 
A2 that they have found another orc, none of the 
trio responds.
A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check of the body reveals several holes in the 
corpse’s neck, arm, and leg where the fiendish crea-
tures successfully attached themselves to the orc. 
Each hole also has up to eight smaller, rough punc-
tures near it where the pincers found purchase.
If the PCs move the body, a weird series of 
cracks and hollow noises escape the joints and 
bones. The orc’s sandals are tattered, and the bot-
tom of his feet are covered in sores and lesions.
Upon closer inspection, the orc wears a thin 
bracelet of elven origin. If it is removed, the PCs’ 
nostrils are assaulted by the smell of death. The 
bracelet’s magic keeps the body from rotting, and 
the process happens almost instantaneously as the 
body transforms in seconds. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Unless the PCs are exceptionally quiet and 
do not use a light source of any kind, the fiendish 
darkmantle in Room A9 is alerted to their presence 
through the open doorway.
By this point, the region should start to feel un-
easy. For low-level characters, the problems staring 
them in the face are not typical. The orcs don’t real-
ly want to fight, and the dead that are found show 
signs of a problem atypical to low-level adventures. 
If you’re looking to prepare them for the rest of 
the campaign, ratchet up the creep factor as they 
explore deeper into the prison.
Treasure: A heavy burlap satchel attached to the 
corpse contains a few silver pieces, a pair of teeth 
(origin unknown), a piece of flint that is wrapped in 

 36
wet cloth, a jeweler’s hammer, 11 feet of rope, two 
iron spikes, and a bone saw.
The orc’s bracelet smells of ocean air and clean 
sand. Whatever magic created it, it still works on a 
new body should a PC wear it. But it only halts and 
does not reverse the rotting process.

A9 . DEATH FROM ABOVE 
Both doors in this Room are open. The southern door 
has been wedged open with a sturdy piece of metal.
An open door on the opposite wall appears to 
be the only other way in or out of this otherwise 
empty room. The floor is suspiciously clean, except 
for a permanent burn mark on the eastern wall.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Clinging to the ceiling of this Room is a 
fiendish darkmantle. The darkmantle is hanging by 
its “foot” in the middle of the ceiling. It has lifted its 
tentacles up and flattened itself out, taking on the 
coloration of the stone as it waits for potential prey 
to move underneath it. A PC succeeding on a DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices an unusual 
lump on the ceiling.
Once the darkmantle drops, the noise of com-
bat attracts a nearby fiendish rat (out scouting for 
its fiendish rat swarm) from Room A10. Given the 
darkness and commotion in Room A9, the fiendish 
rat’s presence goes completely unnoticed unless a 
PC states they are specifically looking for additional 
danger, at which time a successful DC 17 Wisdom 
(Perception) check reveals the fiendish rodent.
As long as it is unobserved, the fiendish rat 
watches the combat to the end and then leaves to 
report the activity to its fellows in Room A11. If it 
is spotted, the fiendish rat immediately flees the 
scene to make its report. 
Tactics: This fiendish darkmantle has patiently waited 
for someone to enter the Room since killing the orc 
in Room A8. It attacks the moment a PC has fully 
entered the Room.
The fiendish darkmantle most likely gains sur-
prise and uses this round to invoke its darkness be-
fore attacking on the next round. This is a common 
darkmantle tactic.
It attacks the first PC into the room, seeking to 
incapacitate them before moving on to the next 
nearest, dealing with each PC in turn. Unless the 
PC has spotted the fiendish darkmantle, he still will 
not know exactly what is happening or where an 
attack might be coming from.
This fiendish darkmantle fights to the death, 
even pursuing fleeing PCs.
Note: It is quite possible for PCs to die in this en-
counter. Consider letting the PCs take on the roles of 
nearby orcs, or if they are reduced to less than 0 hit 
points, make their first death save automatic.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Echoes 
5, Fearless
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the fiendish darkmantle hide directly above 
the doorway, increasing the Perception check DC 
to 21. Consider having a second fiendish rat appear 
and attack the PCs while engaged. To decrease 
the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish 
darkmantle fly into the Room as the PCs enter. Both 
sides are surprised.
A10 . THE WATCHER IN THE 
DOORWAY
Both doors to this Room are open. The following 
description omits the presence of the fiendish rat. 
Peering through the open doorway, you discern for 
certain that the room is empty. There is an open 
door that seems to be the only exit.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The fiendish dire rat most likely ran to 
join the fight in Room A9. Unless the party defeated 
the fiendish darkmantle in Room A9 without mak-
ing noise, the fiendish dire rat fought there and is 
not here. If the fiendish dire rat is caught unaware, 
it flees quickly, avoiding combat at all costs.
Wary PCs succeeding at a DC 14 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check while in the Room hear the sound 
of hundreds of tiny nails scratching on stone as the 
fiendish rat swarm approaches.
One round after the PCs enter this Room, the 
fiendish rat swarm, alerted by its scout, enters from 
the open north door and attacks. The swarm hisses, 

37
leaving a trail of saliva, slime, and urine in its wake. 
Patches of discolored hair contrast the overwhelm-
ing black fur of the swarm. It is unclear if this is a 
mutation or a sign of disease.
Those who fail their Wisdom (Perception) check 
are surprised.
Tactics: The fiendish rat swarm washes into the 
Room like its namesake, attempting to cover as 
many PCs as possible within its 10-ft. square. Its 
members fight to the death, pursuing fleeing PCs.
PCs may use a door to block the progress of the 
fiendish rat swarm. Although the wave is capable 
of opening unattended doors, its collective mem-
bers are too weak to open a door held closed by a 
PC. Faced with such an obstacle, the wave batters 
against it for 5 rounds and then looks for a way 
around the obstacle or seeks out more acces-
sible prey.
If possible, they attack good characters first. 
Each round, the swarm damages a PC, roll on the 
following chart.

shapes or produce fear effects. Have their torches 
dim, etc. The rats are intelligent and might com-
ment on the taste of the character’s blood or how 
killing them now is a kindness compared to what 
awaits further into the dungeon. Some foreshad-
owing of potential threats awaiting the PCs is a 
good way of both increasing tension and playing 
fair as a GM.
This is only the tenth encounter. Keep the PCs 
guessing. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add a second 
fiendish rat swarm. To decrease the challenge, 
the swarm arrives in 1d4 rounds and does not 
gain surprise.
A11 . BONES IN THE HALL
Both doors into this hallway are open. 
A single small (nonhuman) skeleton lies in this 10-
ft. wide hallway. Bits of clothing and leather armor 
cling to its frame. The skeleton shudders a bit but 
falls still. It wants to stand but can’t. The head 
turns to face the PCs but then falls off its neck. 
One hand twitches on the skeleton’s belt.
Two open doors, one on either end of the hallway, 
give no clue as to what lies beyond.
Initial Attitude: Varies
Encounter: The skeleton is the remains of a kobold 
captive brought back by an orc patrol and killed by 
Orghar. He was left here as a warning before being 
picked clean by the fiendish rat swarm.
If the PCs have not encountered a kobold before, 
they do not know what the skeleton is. Conversely, 
allow a DC 15 Wisdom (Nature) check to identify it.
Carefully examining the skeleton shows hun-
dreds of tiny bite marks on the bones and leather 
armor. Looking through the open doorway to the 
north reveals four more open doors (Rooms A12 
through A15). The skeleton tries to stand and ani-
mate, but the magic is weak, and it just twitches.
It mutters the same phrase over and over again 
in draconic. “The trees are beautiful in Autumn. 
The Introduction presents a number of ways 
to get a party started in the World’s Largest 
Dungeon. A more specific example is suggest-
ed here, detailing the ambitions of Longtail and 
the imp Achsyyx. Although the exact reasons 
for the PCs’ travel to the dungeon are up to the 
GM, Longtail’s plans feed directly into the plot 
of this region.
If you include this canon, Longtail has stolen 
a book of rituals from a nearby church.
In its simplest form, this means the PCs 
could be retained by said church to stop Long-
tail’s plans. This is also a handy way to ensure 
that the PCs are adequately equipped before 
entering the dungeon, with the third party pro-
viding essential aid, such as perhaps an ongo-
ing source of magical lighting or two.
An alternative idea is the PCs have had a 
run-in with Longtail or his humanoid allies 
before entering the World’s Largest Dungeon. 
This would require the GM to author up his 
pre-pre-adventure. Nothing complicated. Just a 
short series of investigations that keep Longtail 
always one step ahead.
Regardless, once the PCs arrive at the dun-
geon, they find themselves in the middle of 
the action. 
The PCs don’t need to be aware of any plots 
to enter the dungeon, either. If they are trea-
sure-seekers searching for a long-lost magic 
item, this might be enough motivation to enter. 
In this case, the PCs just happen to be unfortu-
nate enough to enter the dungeon shortly after 
the release of the extraplanar beasts.
PLOT HOOKS

39
Serve the Lady of Eggs. It’s a bitter harvest. Longtail 
lies. The bat lies. Save the eggs.”
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the skeleton come to life when the PCs 
are near. It is not full health and probably won’t be 
much of a match for the PCs, but it should warn 
them of things to come (much later).
A12 . ORC QUARTERS
The door to this Room is open.
Peering through the open door, you find out this 
room is a disaster area. Unpleasant hints of animal 
waste fill the air, and scraps of clothing, bits of 
wood, and other trash cover the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This was one of the Rooms the orcs 
used as sleeping quarters. The few items of fur-
niture there, along with the former occupants’ 
clothing, backpacks, and other possessions, have 
been chewed to pieces by the fiendish rat swarm 
(Room A10).
The smell is rodent waste with a hint of sulfur. 
It stings the nose, along with the overpowering 
scent of urine.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 12 Investigation check 
allows a PC to visually pick a few salvageable items 
amid the debris: a rusted, normal dagger, a dented 
tin drinking cup, three silver coins from a forgot-
ten age, a 5-ft. length of chain, and a bent key that 
could go to almost anything. A DC 16 Strength 
check straightens the key. Rolling too high, howev-
er, breaks the key.
Scaling: N/A
A13 . GNAWERS
The door to this room is open. 
Unpleasant odors linger. This one greets you 
before you step through the open door. The smell, 
combined with the trash-covered floor, makes it 
clear that the rodents’ path of destruction came 
through here.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Two fiendish dire rats, following the 
fiendish rat swarm, busily sift through the trash, 
hoping that the wave missed something. So far, 
they have had little success. One of them has an 
extra set of crooked fangs hanging from its mouth. 
The other has extra, frail limbs dragging behind 
its body. The limbs are useless but unnerving 
to look at.
More intelligent than their Prime Material coun-
terparts, these fiendish dire rats work as a team. 
One sifts through the rubbish while the other keeps 
watch. Unless the PCs are moving without a light 
source of any kind, they have no chance to surprise 
these infernal rodents (DC 22 stealth check).
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Fearless
Tactics: The fiendish dire rats are difficult to surprise 
given their scent ability; they can detect the pres-
ence of a PC within 30 ft. (although they must be 
within 5 ft. of a PC to detect his exact location). The 
fiendish dire rat on watch squeaks a warning to his 
companion as soon as he spots light or hears the 
movement of the PCs. Both fiendish dire rats hide 
in the rubbish that fills the room, requiring a suc-
cessful DC 16 Perception check to be noticed.
This duo is smart enough to avoid a fight 
against an obviously much stronger foe. They attack 
a lone PC or even two, rushing out from ambush to 
gain surprise or flank (if possible).
If more than two PCs enter the Room at the 
same time, the fiendish dire rats remain hidden, 
bursting from hiding only when spotted or if a PC 
gets too close and fleeing out of the Room toward 
the northeastern portion of the dungeon.
If the fiendish dire rats attack, they fight until 
reduced to one-half of their hit points or until out-
numbered, at which point they flee. If flight is not 
possible, they fight to the death. The fiendish dire 

 40
rats pursue fleeing PCs, attacking the rearmost PC 
and allowing the others to escape.
Treasure: A successful DC 12 Investigation check al-
lows a PC to visually pick one salvageable item amid 
the debris: old and dented manacles that might 
fit a child.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, give the dire rats a fear ability and/or disease. 
Consider adding one more dire rat. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, add a third fiendish 
dire rat but have them all fight over a scrap of food 
when the PCs enter the Room, giving the PCs a 
round of surprise.
A14 . ORC QUARTERS
The door to this Room is open. 
Trash lays in the hallway. The smashed door indi-
cates something was already here. Instincts tell you 
the room has been ransacked. Once inside, you see 
the remnants of a bed in one corner of this room, 
but everything else has been thoroughly destroyed.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This was the Room of two orc barbarians 
and actually contained a bed that one of the pair 
had scavenged from Room A20. Unfortunately, the 
fiendish rat swarm has torn the place to bits. The 
bed is nothing more than a plank on four legs.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: With a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check, the PCs notice a small tin box lying un-
der the bed. The box is six inches long, three inches 
wide, and two inches high. It has a clasp that is held 
closed by a piece of metal wedged into the ring. 
On the lid is a lion crest from a nearby kingdom, 
indicating a human was once here, though it’s un-
clear how long ago. The crest’s motto is “Those who 
serve the lion, serve themselves.” GMs are welcome 
to alter this to fit their own campaign worlds.
The box is not trapped or otherwise locked. 
Inside, the box is lined with black silk and has three 
indentations to hold vials. Although there are two 
vials in the box, one of them is broken, and its 
contents have settled into the silk. There is current-
ly only one intact vial in the box: a greater potion 
of helaing.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
lock the box. To decrease the challenge, add another 
vial and indentation.
A15 . CORNERED FIENDISH DARK-
MANTLES
The door to this room is open.
The bitter smell of rodent dung and decay is 
overwhelming. Trash is strewn across the floor, 
ankle-high in most places. The occasional blood-
stain marks the floor and walls, accompanied by 
a black and purple inky residue. A severed hand is 
evident on a small pile of trash, and an exposed 
arm bone has been gnawed on. A trio of dead rats 
are nothing more than entrails and bones. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This is a former orc sleeping area; the 
fiendish rat swarm cleaned out what remained from 
dozens of previous raids.
Clinging to the ceiling of this Room are two 
fiendish darkmantles. Realizing they had become 
prey to a nearby swarm, the pair retreated here to 
await the rodents’ passing. They wait for the danger 
to pass, clinging to the center of the room. Splotchy 
purple birthmarks on one of the darkmantles make 
it easier for it to hide.
Note: The pair keeps a close watch on the door by 
constantly emitting high-frequency sounds, making 
it almost impossible to surprise them.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Darkness
Tactics: The fiendish darkmantles work as a team in 
their pursuit of prey. Once they are aware that it is 
a group of humanoids — and assuming the odds 
aren’t overwhelmingly against them — one dark-
mantle moves to position itself directly above the 
door, while the other moves into the far corner to 
be harder to spot (DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) for 
the one above the door, DC 20 for the one in the far 
corner). If the PC states that he is specifically look-
ing at the ceiling, grant an advantage to the roll.
The fiendish darkmantles surprise the first PC 
through the door, with the one in the far corner us-
ing its surprise round to invoke its darkness ability 
while the one above the door attacks the PC. Even 

41
if the PC spots the fiendish darkmantle on the far 
wall, the one above the door may still have surprise.
If the duo cannot achieve surprise, the one on 
the far wall invokes its darkness ability while the 
other attacks. In all cases, the darkmantles keep the 
combat near the doorway to prevent numerous PCs 
from flanking them while, in turn, gaining flanking 
positions on the PC near the doorway.
If either fiendish darkmantle is reduced to less 
than one-half their hit points (or is killed), they 
flee using their darkness ability to help cover their 
escape. The fiendish darkmantles pursue fleeing 
PCs, concentrating on the rearmost and letting the 
others go.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add a third darkmantle inside the room and/
or another fiendish darkmantle that attacks a PC 
in the hall, thus limiting movement. To decrease 
the challenge, remove the darkmantle’s ability to 
surprise the PCs.
A16 . SOUTHERN  
HALLWAY ROOM
Both doors in this room are open. 
You can already see the exit of this room, an open 
door directly across from you. Like so many rooms 
before it, the interior is filled with trash. The smell 
is either improving, or you are growing used to it.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is empty, save some dust and 
detritus. The moment the PCs enter this room, roll 
Wisdom (Perception) checks every round for the 
fiendish stirges in Room A18 (fiendish stirges have a 
+0 to Wisdom (Perception) checks; roll as a group). 
If the PCs are spotted or heard, the fiendish stirges 
fly down to investigate.
PCs who are capable of seeing through the open 
doorways into Room A18 (using darkvision) may 
make DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) checks to see the 
fiendish stirges. All PCs with a passive Perception of 
12 or higher can hear the agitated little beasts.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions or 
Extreme Cold
Tactics: Once the nearby darkmantles and stirges are 
defeated, this is a safe room to rest in.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the fiendish stirges in Room A18 roll at ad-
vantage. To decrease the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the fiendish stirges in Room A18 roll at 
disadvantage.
A17 . MIDDLE HALLWAY ROOM
Both the doors in this room are open. 
This room looks much like the others, with bare 
walls and nothing else to look at. A strange wood-
en triptych has fallen from the wall and broken.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Like Room A16, this room is completely 
empty. Assuming that neither side has spotted the 
other, continue to make a single Wisdom (Perception) 
check each round for the six fiendish stirges in Room 
A18 as well as for the PCs (DC 12).
Encounter Condition: Drafty, Echoes 2
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Now worthless, the wood-etched triptych 
was probably valuable at one time. The carvings of 
animals and plants show serene iconography in this 
otherwise dank environment. 
Scaling: N/A

A18 . NORTHERN  
HALLWAY ROOM
All three doors in this room are open. 
This room appears to be a junction, with three 
open doorways leading in different directions. Like 
the previous two rooms, it is empty. Something 
about it indicates the room was used for something 
else, a long time ago. Your intuition is screaming 
this place is more than just an underground vault. 
Perhaps a prison. Or a torture chamber. A place 
where things were collected and stored. The lack of 
any features seems almost alien and fiendish.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: As in Rooms A16 and A17, this Room is 
completely empty. It served as a junction Room 
and defense point for the orcs. Before that, it would 
have been a transfer point for prisoners. The doors 
and wall radiate the faintest abjuration magic to 
those who would detect it.
If they have not spotted the PCs previously, six 
fiendish stirges alternate flying and hopping about 
the room, obviously agitated. Deciding that this 
was an excellent spot to wait for potential prey, the 
six have taken up residence. However, given their 
alignment, the fiendish stirges do not trust one an-
other. As such, they continuously hop and fly from 
perch to perch to prevent one another from being 
the first to feed.
The stirges have been mutated and transformed by 
the fiendish magic that claimed them. Their hooked 
bills are split in two, segmenting their faces. Their 
eyes have grown into two vertical, but not symmet-
rical, sets on each side of their faces. Each fiendish 
stirge is slightly different from the next but with 
terrifying and bizarre visages.
Encounter Condition: Concealment
Tactics: When one of the fiendish stirges sees or 
hears something of interest, it goes to investigate, 
and the others follow. In the case of the PCs mov-
ing through A16 and A17 or either of the hallways, 
roll Wisdom (Perception) checks for the fiendish 
stirges as the PCs move. On a successful Wisdom 
(Perception) check (DC 13), one of the fiendish 
stirges has either seen the PCs or heard them and 
flies off to investigate. One round later, two more 
fiendish stirges follow the first, and on the third 
round, the remaining ones follow. The lead fiendish 
stirge attacks the first PC it comes across, and the 
others join in as soon as they arrive.
Each fiendish stirge fights as an individual and will 
not cooperate with another stirge. They prefer to 
seek out their own victims rather than share. As a 
result, each PC finds themselves fighting at least 
one stirge directly. In combat, the stirges use their 
ability to fly to dart in, drain a PC, and then evade 
retribution. They continually switch the PC they’re 
attacking, buzzing about and around the group like 
flies around red meat. 
An individual fiendish stirge will not pursue a flee-
ing PC as long as there is an open PC in the imme-
diate area.
Although aggressive, the fiendish stirges are also 
cowards. If damaged, each flees, abandoning the 
others to their fate. If two of the six are killed, the 
remaining flee.
A satiated fiendish stirge (one that has drained 4 
points of Constitution) will fly off down the hallway 
to the east to find a place to digest its meal.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have all six of the fiendish stirges arrive at the same 
time. To decrease the challenge of the encounter, 
have two of the fiendish stirges begin to fight each 
other rather than the PCs.
It is possible that this fight will be over quickly. 
Feel free to bring in more scavenger-type rein-
forcements—more dire rats, for instance. Have 
another stirge show up, but it has a series of weird 
powers and even more messed-up features. The 
list goes on.
A19 . REFUSE 
PCs approaching within 20 ft of this alcove become 
aware of the putrid smell. Read the following text 
when they reach the alcove. 
You have traced the smell to its source: a hole some 
eighteen inches in diameter cracks the stone floor in 
the corner. Two fat, deformed worms lie dead inside 
the hole. Each worm is about a foot in diameter 
and several feet long. One climbs up from the hole, 
the other locked around the head of the first. The 
first has a ruptured stomach and smells of offal. 

43
It appears that the first died from the inside out, 
splitting itself open from overeating. The second 
appears to have started to eat the first and choked 
to death, if that is possible? Rats have, regardless, 
avoided this easy feast.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The hole is actually a small crack that 
appeared during a minor earthquake. The hole 
has become a home for trash, refuse, and disease. 
Giant, unforeseen, discolored, and diseased worms 
have died inside the hole. Any contact with the 
stone, trash, or worms makes one susceptible to 
catching filth fever. 
Filth Fever. DC 11 Constitution save. On a failure: in 1d3 
days, Dexterity and Constitution are each reduced 
by 1d4 until the disease is removed. Repeat save ev-
ery 8 hours. Filth Fever ends after three consecutive 
successful DC 11 Constitution saves.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (filth fever), 
Stagnant Air
Tactics: Consider adding the sound of insects and 
vermin as the PCs approach. While there is a warn-
ing of what they are approaching, the creatures 
need not look like anything they’ve seen before. 
Mutate the bugs, if necessary. They feed on the 
worms slowly.

A20 . ORGHAR'S QUARTERS
The door to this Room is open as is the secret door in 
the eastern wall. 
A table, a stool, and a bed, all intact, sit across 
from the door. In the center of the room, a circle 
of six stools surrounds a small mound of dirt on 
the floor. An otherworldly feeling of evil permeates 
the air. Just standing at the doorway, one can feel 
something bad happened here.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This was Orghar’s bedroom and head-
quarters. The Room is almost exactly as he left it 
when he went to lead the orcs in the final assault 
against the reptilians. But evil lingers here. Those 
sensitive to it cannot avoid it.
Orghar’s evil permeates everything here. And 
all because of a ring. A ring gifted by Achsyyx to 
Longtail made it into Orghar’s possession a little 
while ago. And that ring has driven Orghar to im-
possible levels of evil.
The ring serves one purpose: to amplify evil. 
Though it is long gone from here (now in Room 
A82), the evil remains. Anyone casting detect good 
and evil finds remnants around the room.
On the top of the table is a summoning circle, 
crudely drawn, perhaps as practice for a real circle 
somewhere else. A hollowed-out kobold skull sits 
on the table along with a backscratcher carved from 
a lizardfolk thigh bone. The bed, a plank with four 
legs, still holds Orghar’s blanket and a pillow made 
from troglodyte skin and stuffed with the hair of 
orcs his clan has defeated in combat. The six stools 
were where Orghar would hold his planning meet-
ings, while the dirt served as a crude chalkboard to 
illustrate his plans. In good military fashion, what-
ever had been drawn on the dirt is obscured.
The secret doors in the southern and eastern 
walls are opened with pressure plates in the floor. 
The plates are stones like any other but are tightly 
pressed against the wall, so finding them isn’t easy. 
Once the plate is pressed, a latch is released, and 
the secret door can open easily.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: Orghar hollowed out one of the legs of 
his bed; a search of the bed reveals this (DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check trick. Inside the 
leg, he stowed seven small pieces of jade (each 
worth 4d4 x 10 gp). Although he meant to retrieve 
the jade, Orghar forgot about the gems and has 
yet to be back for them. The jade pieces have been 
tainted with evil, like most of Orghar’s effects. The 
taint will dissipate eventually, but touching them is 
ill-advised.
Behind a few bits of wood, a leather pouch with 
a deck of playing cards featuring four new suits 
(sword, fireball, whip, and spider) and a gold ring 
with an opal inlay (worth 280 gp) are hidden.
Scaling: N/A 
A21 . THE SECRET ROOM 
The eastern door leading to Room A72 is trapped. 
Pulling the door open releases scything blades 

 44
located underneath it. The blades swing out at any-
one standing closest to the door (usually the person 
opening the door; each blade swings into the square 
directly in front of the door), dealing 2d8 damage. A 
hidden bolt near the outside edge of the door can be 
pushed down to keep the blades in place. The trap is 
reset when the door is closed. 
Spots of blood on the floor outside the door hint at 
a trap, but in the darkness the PCs may not notice it. 
Several rough tables are scattered throughout 
this room. Poorly constructed chairs are pushed 
under the tables. Everything is coated with a fine 
layer of dust.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room has not been occupied in quite 
some time, somehow being missed through all the 
years it stood empty.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: Despite the trapped door, this Room is an ex-
cellent place for the PCs to rest. The room tends to 
swallow up the light, halving the distance of torches 
and candles. Light-based magic works normally.
Treasure: A careful search (Intelligence (Investigation) 
check, DC 16) reveals a few minor personal effects 
that escaped notice over the year—a personal 
brooch, a snuff box, and a perfectly round pebble 
that inexplicably weighs two pounds.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add fire and/or radiant damage and a second set of 
blades that swings out from behind. To decrease the 
challenge, allow the PCs a DC 12 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check because of the blood.
A22-A24 . PILLAR ROOMS
Rooms A22 to A24 are part of the original construc-
tion of this dungeon. Although the dungeon’s cre-
ators did not require much comfort, they did create 
some places to pass the time. This is one of the areas 
and consists of these three Rooms, each with a differ-
ent function.
The humanoids all knew of these Rooms but only 
used Room A22 for its water supply. They never real-
ized the magical properties of Room A23 and avoided 
Room A24 due to the uncomfortable silence. Current-
ly, there is only one monster in these Rooms.
A22 . WATER PILLARS
The door to this Room is open. 
You hear the sound of trickling water as you ap-
proach. The sound comes from four pillars, one in 
each corner of the large room, with water channels 
cut into them.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly 
Encounter: The running water imposes disadvantage 
on all Wisdom (Perception) checks to hear made by 
any creatures either while in the Room and trying 
to listen to noise within or outside the Room, or for 
creatures outside of the Room trying to make out 
noises from inside the Room.
Before the PCs have a chance to refresh them-
selves, they must contend with the ogre that is 
currently catching a rest here.
This Room, along with Rooms A23 and A24, is 
actually part of the original construction of the 
dungeon. The water that runs down the pillars is 
the result of a permanent create or destroy water 
effect that resides in a hole in the top of each pillar. 
Water flows down a channel cut into the pillar, 
which is somewhat larger at its base than at its top, 
and ends up in a small 1-ft. diameter and 1-ft. deep 
pool at the base of the pillar. Thanks to the magic, 
the system is constantly in balance, and as long as 
no more than two gallons of water are taken in any 
round, no drop in the water flow or in the pool will 
be noticed.
If detect magic is used on the pillars, they radiate 
a strong (but old) transmutation aura. Destroying 
the pillars destroys the magic. Although the original 

45
inhabitants did not need the water for survival, it is 
perfectly drinkable.
Except for the pillars, this Room is otherwise 
empty. There were once meditation mats but 
they are long gone. Rotted pieces might still be 
around the room.
Encounter Condition: Drafty or Poor Footing 2
Tactics: Bragdor the ogre is not the brightest of 
fellows, but even he knows when he is overmatched 
and the beasts that are crawling all over the dun-
geon intimidate even him. Of course, he can deal 
with the humanoids, and the PCs are ideal for 
taking out his frustrations.
Bragdor’s face is covered with scars from fight-
ing darkmantles. Though the wounds aren’t new, 
they haven’t completely healed yet. His greatclub 
has rat teeth buried throughout its length, partially 
as ornamentation and partially for effect. The han-
dle is wrapped in darkmantle skin. Bragdor carries 
a very sharp camp knife. He uses it mostly for odd 
jobs, not fighting. But it’ll cut someone up pretty 
well in a pinch.
Even though he sits on the ground, resting 
his bulk against the northeastern pillar, Bragdor 
notices any light source moving down the hallway 
or coming from A23 readily enough, and once he 
spots it, he readies himself for some sport. Due to 
the noise of the water falling, he is unlikely to hear 
any creatures before they enter the Room unless 
they are making a lot of noise (the ogre suffers dis-
advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks made 
to listen). Depending on where the light is coming 
from, he attempts to hide his bulk behind a pillar 
(the northwestern pillar if the light comes from the 
hall or simply standing by the pillar he is resting 
against if the light is coming from Room A23).
If Bragdor manages to hide, he is actually 
difficult to Spot in the shadow of the pillar (DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check) until a light shines 
on him, at which point he is easily seen. Whether 
he is hidden or not, the moment he spots some-
thing, he takes a defensive pose, gauging how the 
PCs will act.
If forced to fight, Bragdor does not hold back. 
Like most ogres, Bragdor is a bully. As long as he 
feels that he has the advantage over his opponents, 
he gladly bashes them away with his huge club. 
Consider giving Bragdor an advantage on his next 
roll after a round in which he deals 10 or more 
points of damage.
If the PCs gain Bragdor’s respect, either by 
reducing him to one-half or fewer of his hit points 
using physical attacks or by causing at least 15 
points of damage from spell attacks, the ogre 
changes his tactics. He backs away from his foes 
toward the most tactically favorable position, using 
full defense while calling out for parley.
It is up to the PCs whether they parley or not. 
If PCs attack, Bragdor fights his way to one of the 
doorways and defends himself there, fighting to 
the death if no other option is available; he only 
makes the parley offer once. If the PCs accept his 
parley offer by lowering their weapons or verbally 
agreeing to it, Bragdor looks around warily before 
lowering his club.
The PCs may, if they choose, talk with the ogre. 
With his newfound respect for the PCs, he is happy 
to engage in conversation and even apologizes 
for any PCs that were injured or killed. Bragdor is 
capable of relating the details of the journey to the 
dungeon, the name of the orc leader (Orghar), the 
history and state of relations between the orcs and 
the other humanoids, as well as the sudden appear-
ance of various strange beasts that attacked every-
one. The exact details of such a conversation are left 
to the GM. Given the ogre’s rather simple mind, 
he is incapable of giving specific details on such 
things as directions or anything beyond simple 
impressions of the beasts (caped bats, big rodents, 
stinging flies).
He knows that Orghar has become more evil 
and violent in recent months? Years? How long 
has it been, he wonders. But he doesn’t know the 
source of this evil. Bragdor remains extremely 
scared of Orghar; the orc’s concentrated malev-
olence left a deep impression. Whenever talking 
about Orghar, Bragdor checks over his shoulder 
to see if the orc is nearby. He tries to avoid saying 
the name out loud, worried it might summon him, 
and performs odd, superstitious little tricks with his 
fingers, warding off the orc’s evil eye. 
If explicitly asked about Longtail, Bragdor has 
trouble remembering who it was, and the PCs 
may have to jog his memory with a description. 
Even then, all he can share is that the “rat-man” 
has been gone for some time. Bragdor cannot 
make the connection between Longtail’s absence 

 46
and the appearance of the beasts in the dungeon 
on his own.
Once the PCs and Bragdor are done talking, 
they may wish to leave. He will not accompany 
them under any circumstances, stating that it 
would not be a good idea if he was seen with them 
because “Orghar might get mad.” 
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
Bragdor surprises the PCs, and no parley is allowed. 
To decrease the challenge of this encounter, reduce 
Bragdor’s hit points total — he was injured from a 
previous fight.
A23 . PILLARS OF ILLUSION 
The doors to this Room are open. 
This room is even larger than the previous one, 
though these four large pillars seem to be made of 
something other than stone. There is a soft hum, 
clearly coming from the corners.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The Room appears empty, and the pillars 
are completely non-descript. This is deceiving as 
the pillars are capable of generating major image 
effects. This is not evident, however, unless some-
one casts detect magic on them, at which point they 
radiate an elusive magical aura. What that means is 
the caster can tell there’s magic here, but it is un-
clear what kind and just how much. The magic itself 
is disguising its power.
Should the magic be uncovered with further 
study, the caster knows it is illusion magic. Creating 
an image requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check. If successful, the creature can create 
a major image that acts exactly as the spell, but only 
in the Room.
If Bragdor in Room A22 has been dealt with, this 
room is a safe place to rest.
Encounter Condition: Haunted
Tactics: Destroying the pillars destroys the magic.
This room was, at one time, an archive for the 
creatures who built this place. These pillars are 
magical repositories for memory. As such, the PCs 
can use them to piece together recent events in 
the region, assuming they can attune to the pillars. 
This requires a DC12 Intelligence (Arcana) check or 
a DC14 Wisdom check. Once attuned, the PCs can 
command the pillars to show their stored memo-
ries–scrolling forward and backward through them 
as they choose. PCs can generate illusions on their 
own. If the PCs spend at least 30 minutes in the 
room, the pillars begin to create soundless illusions 
revealing angels and demons inside the prison. 
Nothing specific beyond a demon being escorted 
by angels, for instance.
Another illusion shows the appearance of Long-
tail and Orghar and their contentious relationship, 
though it does not reveal their names. There’s the 
image of Orghar fighting reptilians and another il-
lusion of fiendish creatures coming through cracks 
in the “air.”
Gamemasters are welcome to give other sound-
less clues about Region A.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: N/A
A24 . PILLARS OF SILENCE 
The door to this Room is open. 
Four pillars dominate the corners of this 
large room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Total quiet exists in this Room courtesy of 
the permenent silence radiated by the pillars. These 
effects are identical to the spell of the same name 
except that the effect is limited to this Room. No 
sound can be generated within the Room and no 
sound passes through the Room, so that sounds 
made out in the hall do not penetrate through 
Room A23 and vice-versa. Casting detect magic on 
the pillars reveals a faint illusion aura.
Encounter Condition: Safe 
Tactics: Destroying the pillars destroys the magic.
Treasure: N/A

A25-A36 . THE MAZE 
The “Maze”, as the humanoids call it, is a mystery. 
Perhaps its maddening design kept prisoners from 
finding the surface. Whatever its purpose, the tight 
quarters, countless doors, and winding halls were a 
perfect reminder of home for this particular tribe of 
troglodytes. 
Orghar had enough tactical acumen to realize that 
dozens of orcs could get bogged down in the “Maze” 
and thus, except for a small force to take Room A25, 
the orcs avoided the area during their final assault 
on the reptilians; Orghar planned to deal with the 
troglodytes later. Although the orcs’ surprise attack 
managed to drive the troglodytes from Room A25, 
the orcs were themselves soon overrun and forced to 
retreat into the “Maze’’ by a large swarm of fiendish 
darkmantles that Longtail had released. Currently, the 
troglodytes hold the eastern Rooms in their grasp, 
having fought off the fiendish darkmantles in the 
narrow halls. They await whatever comes next. 
Due to the close quarters and the effects of the 
troglodyte musk, this is a dangerous area for even 
a well-prepared party, especially near Rooms A31 
through A34. Before having the PCs enter, thoroughly 
study this section of the dungeon. 
The doors in the maze portion, that is, the doors 
between hallways, are all open unless otherwise indi-
cated. Doors between hallways can open in either di-
rection; the decision is the GM’s. Note that any action 
that takes place within the hallways of the maze itself 
will be referenced in the description of the Room that 
is closest to the action.
A25 . PILLAR ROOM 
All doors to and from this Room are open. 
A giant pillar, some 10 feet in diameter and rising 
from floor to ceiling, dominates this room. Defaced 
images cover every inch of the column, leaving no 
clue as to what they might have once been. Several 
open doorways lead out of the room, but they 
were obviously of little use to the orc corpses that 
litter the floor. Several bodies of reddish, leathery, 
octopus-like creatures are scattered about, one still 
attached to an orc’s head.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: The images of the pillar are beyond 
recognition, horribly defaced. The seven orcs are 
remnants of Orghar’s strike force sent to take this 
Room, killed by the swarm of fiendish darkmantles 
that flooded through the area. They learned too 
late that the extraplanar beasts are quite capable of 
opening doors. Examining the orcs shows that all of 
them have lolling tongues and bulging eyes or bro-
ken necks. They were clearly attacked by the fiendish 
darkmantles. 
Currently, eight fiendish dire rats root through 
the remains for choice pieces.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions
Tactics: Having followed the fiendish darkmantles in 
the hopes of picking up scraps, these fiendish dire 
rats are busily gorging themselves and have disad-
vantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect 
the PCs’ approach.
The moment the PCs are detected, the fiendish 
dire rats take up a defensive posture, arched backs, 
hackles up, and hissing, but they do not attack 
unless provoked. They are not interested in the 
PCs and would rather have the easy meal that is 
already provided than fight with a new foe. As long 
as the PCs leave the fiendish dire rats alone, the 
rats reciprocate, going back to their meals and only 
occasionally hissing a warning in the PCs’ direction. 
The PCs should recognize the signs of an animal 
defending its territory, but if not, allow them a DC 
12 Intelligence (Nature) check or DC 14 Wisdom 
(Survival) check to understand the situation. 
The PCs can move about the Room as long 
as they avoid the fiendish dire rats. If a PC gets 
within 10 feet, a fiendish dire rat gives a warning 
snap of its teeth. If a PC gets within 5 feet, the dire 
rat attacks. 
If it comes down to combat, the fiendish dire 
rats defend their territory, fighting as best they 
can. Individual fiendish dire rats retreat or flee 
if reduced to one-half hit points (or fewer). The 
remaining fiendish dire rats retreat if three or more 
of their number are killed. These rats do not pursue 
fleeing PCs, being more than happy to feast on the 
dead orcs.

 48
Treasure: In addition to the arms and armor (rusty 
scimitars, old hand axes, a cleaver, a punch dagger, 
a pair of sharp stilettos, a small shield, and a suit 
of oversized studded leather armor), PCs can find a 
few items of interest on the orcs with a successful 
DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check — a small 
block of hack silver (a chunk of silver from which 
pieces are cut to pay for items; worth 37 sp); a gold 
nose ring (6 gp) threaded through an orc’s nostril; 
a small leather bag with three pieces of lapis lazuli 
(12 gp each); a set of well-worn ivory knucklebones 
(3 gp); a silver and gold bracelet with images of 
dolphins (75 gp); a small, bright golden feather 
woven into one orc’s hair (actually a Quaal’s Feather 
Token (whip)). 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the fiendish dire rats fight to the death. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, the PCs 
surprise the fiendish dire rats.
A26 . THE NARROW ROOM 
The door to this Room is open. 
Two naked orc corpses lie in the back of this long 
and narrow room, obviously the victims of the oc-
topus-like creatures. The room is otherwise empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: These orcs were forced to retreat to this 
Room when the fiendish darkmantles attacked and 
were killed for their efforts. They bled out slowly 
from their wounds. Their weapons and armor were 
stripped away by troglodytes, except for one crude, 
unbalanced greataxe that was too heavy to carry 
away. The troglodytes, finally able to effectively 
repay the orcs, hacked up the corpses in a show of 
petty vengeance.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs are here for more than 10 minutes, 
roll a random encounter. Under no condition is this 
Room a safe place to rest.
Treasure: One of the orcs has a crude treasure map 
tattooed onto his back. It does not look like any 
place the PCs recognize, but the GM is encouraged 
to have it lead somewhere if the PCs ever escape 
this dungeon.
Scaling: N/A 
A27 . STORAGE ROOM 
The door to this Room is open. 
Several shovels and picks lay against one corner 
of the wall. A corpse, an orc by the look of it, lays 
in the other corner, a flying octopus attached 
to his head.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Although the PCs may at first assume 
that the fiendish darkmantle is feeding on the orc, 
this is not the case. A successful DC 10 Wisdom 
(Perception) check or simply walking up to the 
corpse reveals a dagger stuck in the beast’s head. 
Out of desperation, the orc stabbed at the fiendish 
darkmantle with his dagger, killing the beast and 
himself. The orc still wears his scale armor, a battle 
ax at his side.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the characters attempt to remove the fiend-
ish darkmantle, or the dagger, from the orc’s head, 
the orc lurches to his feet. The prolonged effects of 
fiendish contamination bring him back from the 
dead as a ghoul of some sort. He attacks immedi-
ately. The orc-ghoul uses the ghoul stat block but 
starts with half the standard hit points and can-
not use the claw’s action. The transformation was 
interrupted by the PCs. Should the orc-ghoul kill 
or eat a PC or another creature, it is immediately 
restored to full health and gains the ability to use 
the claws action.
If Turag is with the party, the ghoul attacks 
him first.
Treasure: Aside from the armor and battle ax, the orc-
ghoul has a pouch with seven bloodstones (30 gp 
each). Any PC that takes a moment to examine the 
dagger or succeeds at a DC 13 Intelligence (investi-
gation) check notices that it is of fine quality and is, 
in fact, a silver dagger.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the ghoul’s armor class, armor, attack bo-
nus, and damage by 2. To decrease the challenge of  
this encounter, the orc doesn’t reanimate, irrespec-
tive of the PCs’ actions.

A28 . THE WHIMPERER IN DARK-
NESS
An orc corpse lies in the hallway just before the door, 
another victim of the fiendish darkmantles. If the PCs 
attempt to open the door, read the following. 
Pushing against the door, you sense resistance.
If the PCs push harder, read the following.
When you push a little harder, the door moves 
slightly before moving back towards you as if 
there is resistance from the other side. Was that a 
whimper you heard?
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The door is being held closed by Turag, 
an orc that managed to survive the fiendish dark-
mantle swarm by seeking refuge in this Room even 
as his fellow orc was being killed right outside the 
door. He is barricading the door by jamming the 
point of a kobold spear under the bottom and hold-
ing on for dear life. 
The PCs can force open the door by succeeding 
at an opposed Strength check against Turag (Turag 
has advantage on the check due to his Strength and 
the leverage the spear provides). But Turag cannot 
hold out forever. He loses advantage after five rolls 
(should he succeed that long). Turag whimpers all 
the while the PCs try opening the door.
Once the door is forced open, Turag retreats 
to the northwestern corner, grasping his battleaxe 
and trying to look as threatening as possible, even 
though he is shaking with fear. A DC 8 Wisdom 
(Insight) check reveals that the orc is clearly in no 
condition/mood for conflict.
If the PCs attack Turag, he goes down fighting 
(see tactics). If, on the other hand, the PCs make 
any friendly overtures, the orc falls to his knees, 
drops his battleaxe, and begins pleading with the 
PCs to help him escape.
Although this exchange should be role-played, 
the GM can resolve this through a DC 14 Charisma 
(Persuasion) check, with advantage if none of the 
party are reptilians or extraplanar creatures. If Bo-
yikt (Room A69) and his kobolds are accompanying 
the PCs, the kobolds attack Turag. Even if the check 
fails, Turag does nothing more than continue to try 
and hold off the PCs by looking as threatening as is 
possible in his current state; he only attacks if he is 
attacked. 
If the PCs agree to help the orc, he is incredibly 
relieved and grateful, throwing himself at his rescu-
ers’ feet and in general being subservient. Although 
he is still an orc, Turag is clever enough to know 
that, at least at this moment, the PCs are his only 
way of making it out alive and will do what he can 
to help them; he plays up the role of the servant 
to the maximum. He’s obsequious, eager to help, 
and always offering strange bits of proverbial orcish 
wisdom such as:
 
A dead badger in your sack is better than a live 
one in your trousers
 
Might as well kill the bastard now than regret not 
killing them later
 
The best way to catch a goblin is firmly by the 
throat.
The PCs could gain an NPC retainer out of this. Con-
versely, if a character has recently died, someone 
can play Turag for a while.
Naturally, this is largely lip service, and Turag 
avoids doing any actual work (especially fighting) 
unless absolutely necessary to defend himself or if 
he is threatened with abandonment or bodily harm. 
What Turag does should the PCs encounter a group 
of his brethren or a powerful antagonist Turag 
might feel inclined to throw his lot in with is up 
to the GM. Having some reliable comic relief in a 
campaign is always a good idea. Turag’s experiences 
in the region might be a useful way of imparting 
information the PCs otherwise miss. Of course, 
having a beloved NPC suddenly turn traitor is a 
dramatically effective move too. Do whatever suits 
your campaign best. 
If the PCs will not help, Turag accepts the judg-
ment with a shrug and returns morosely to his cor-
ner. The orc does not say anything to, or respond to 
anything from, the PCs from that point on. How-
ever, once the PCs leave the Room, Turag stealthily 
follows them, dogging their steps just out of range 
of any light sources. He is determined to follow the 
only chance he has at salvation. Even if caught at 
this game, Turag does not give it up unless the PCs 
kill him. If confronted about his actions, he whines 
and pleads ad nauseum, making a series of increas-
ingly implausible claims about his various talents. 

 50
Turag can relate the general events of the orc 
entry into the dungeon and their battles against 
the reptilians. He has no idea where the beasts hail 
from; he only knows that his small band of warriors 
was suddenly attacked by a huge swarm of leathery, 
flying, octopus things. Once in this Room, Turag 
took safety (he won’t mention the part about barri-
cading it against his fellow orcs) and was somehow 
missed in the excitement.
Turag cannot tell the PCs much of anything 
about the dungeon itself. Being a simple warrior he 
did what he was told and did not bother with the 
details. The previous combats with the reptilians 
are a blur of Room-to-Room combat and he has no 
actual recollection of the routes. As a result, Turag 
can in no way serve as a guide to the PCs as he 
does not know anything, and “everything looks the 
same anyway.” That doesn’t mean he won’t claim to 
be able to guide them if he curries favor.
Asking the orc about Longtail receives little 
response. He only saw the “rat-man” once or twice 
and then only when he was talking with Orghar. 
He has not seen the “rat-man” in some time and 
has no idea what he might be up to. Turag does not 
make the connection between Longtail’s absence 
and the appearance of the beasts in the dungeon 
on his own.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Cover
Tactics: If the PCs attack Turag, he fights to the death 
as best he can in his shaken state (consider him to 
have 2 levels of exhaustion).
If he joins the PCs, Turag stays out of combat, 
letting the PCs do all the work. He defends himself 
if attacked, while crying for help. If threatened by 
the PCs, Turag actively engages in combat to save 
his own skin, and then only if a PC fights beside 
him; he will stop the moment he is able. At no time 
will Turag risk his life to save or help a PC unless he 
feels the PCs will kill him if he does not.
Turag is a covert coward, however. He tries to be 
near combat sufficiently to claim involvement but 
not so much he might actually become involved. 
Afterward, he regales anyone who’ll listen with all 
the ways he aided the party, not-so-subtly hinting 
their victory was really due to his assistance.

A29 . CASUALTIES 
The secret door to this Room has been wedged open 
with rusted equipment and orc bodies.
Close to a dozen orc bodies lie in various places 
about the room, along with an equal number of fly-
ing octopus creatures. Several chairs and tables are 
also present, no doubt scattered during the battle.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Close to a dozen orc bodies lie in various 
places about the room, along with an equal num-
ber of the flying octopus creatures. Several chairs 
and tables are also present, no doubt scattered 
during the battle: Once used as a marshaling hall, 
the Room is presently empty except for the bodies. 
However, once the PCs have been inside the Room 
for two rounds, a fiendish rat swarm enters the hall-
way leading to this Room from the southern door 
and heads for the Room in search of more prey. If 
the PCs spend less than two rounds in the Room 
or simply look inside and leave, the wave enters the 
hallway while the PCs are still in it.
Large, hungry, emboldened fire ants feed on the 
bodies. Consider making them into a swarm that 
fights the PCs if the PCs encroach on their meal.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The fiendish rat swarm has been tracking 
the PCs since picking up their scent in Room A25. 

51
Although primarily scavengers, this wave is actively 
hunting for live flesh. 
As the wave enters and rolls down the hall, allow 
the PCs DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) checks where 
appropriate in order to note its arrival. 
The fiendish rat swarm’s tactics are straight-
forward: it sweeps into Room A29 and covers the 
maximum number of PCs in its 10-ft. by 10-ft. area. 
The fiendish rat swarm fights to the death, pursu-
ing fleeing PCs and tracking them by scent if they 
get out of sight.
If the PCs spot the wave in time, they can push 
closed the door to Room A29, using their bodies to 
block the door and prevent the wave from entering. 
The wave batters unsuccessfully against the door 
for four or five rounds before all becomes still. If 
the PCs open the door at any time thereafter, the 
wave rushes through, having waited in silence for 
the PCs to do just that. 
Clever PCs might think to look under the door 
or might succeed at a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) 
check and notice the wave still waiting outside. 
In that case, the wave eventually moves off down 
the hallway to lurk in the shadows at the western 
end, waiting for the PCs to open the door and step 
out — at which point the swarm rushes down the 
hallway to attack. 
Treasure: Along with the usual orc arms and 
armor, a careful search of the orc bodies reveals 
a few spoils with a successful DC 12 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check — a battleaxe with the runes 
of the manufacturer engraved in the blade. This is a 
battle axe and is the work of the renowned dwarven 
weaponsmith, Dorin Steelforge; a hunk of amber 
(11 gp); a necklace of teeth of various kinds (no 
value); a length of red silk ribbon tied in an orc’s 
hair (dirty beyond cleansing and thus no value); 
three silver earrings in one orc’s ear (8 gp, 10 gp, 
and 17 gp respectively); a small ivory carving of a 
lion (25 gp); a punching dagger embedded in one of 
the fiendish darkmantles.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the secret door crushed to rubble so the 
PCs cannot easily block the entrance. To decrease 
the challenge, reduce the hit points of the fiend-
ish rat swarm to one-half prior to the start of the 
encounter and/or allow it to occupy only a 5-ft. by 
10-ft. area.
A30-A36 . SICK AND TIRED
The hallways and Rooms north of Room A30 and west 
of and A36 are the home of the troglodytes. PCs that 
enter the area are automatically considered poisoned 
the entire time they are within the area from the 
strong concentration of troglodyte musk that per-
vades the area. 
They must also succeed on a DC 11 Constitution 
save when within the hallways or Rooms A31, A35, 
and A36. On a failed save, the PC is nauseated (un-
able to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do 
anything else requiring attention; only a single move 
action per turn is possible) for 1 minute, after which 
time they continue to be poisoned for as long as they 
are in the area but can no longer be nauseated. Be-
cause of the massive concentration of musk, there is 
no need to roll for reactions to the musk of individual 
troglodytes while in this area.
As the PCs pass through this area, they notice a 
number of fiendish darkmantle corpses (roughly one 
every 10 ft.) the troglodytes killed as they retreated 
down the hall.
The only way to eliminate the sickening effect is to 
leave the area (either go south of Room A29 or east 
of Room A36), at which point the sickening effect 
remains for another 1d4 rounds.
There are a number of options for characters 
wishing to counter the smell. A rag dipped in vinegar 
(found in Rooms A5, A70, and A79), or alcohol, and 
worn as a mask negates the smell as it hits the PCs 
faces, thus eliminating the penalty. A magic-user with 
a spell like Gust of Wind can be used to dispel the 
noxious musk in a room, while more reckless PCs 
might try and burn it out.
The GM should be open to creative methods to try 
and overcome, or at least mitigate, the effects of the 
troglodyte musk.

A30 . OPEN ROOM 
The door to this Room is open.
A near-naked troglodyte lies in the comer, stran-
gulation evident on its features. Next to him lies a 
flying octopus creature, its body torn apart.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The dead troglodyte was one of three on 
guard in this Room when the fiendish darkmantles 
struck. His partners managed to retreat to Room 
A31 and warn the troglodytes there while he fended 
them off. He was easy prey. The others assumed he 
died, but didn’t stick around to find out.
If the PCs turn over the body, they find an ornate 
tattoo covering the troglodyte’s back, from neck to 
ass. The tattoo is the symbol for war in the troglo-
dyte’s language. It is a symbol for protection as well 
and may have conferred magical defenses on him.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: A well-worn and crude spear lies next 
to the troglodyte. He possessed very little. Not 
even armor. 
Scaling: Consider having the tattoo leap from the 
troglodyte’s body to a brave warrior who examines 
the body. It permanently grafts to his body and 
confers a +1 AC bonus.
A31 . A NOT-SO-TASTY MEAL 
The doors to this Room are open. 
The bodies of two troglodytes lie on the floor, ob-
viously suffocated to death. Stirges suck whatever 
blood remains in their desiccated corpses.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: These troglodytes met their fate as the 
fiendish darkmantles swept through the area. The 
fiendish darkmantles are long gone, having pushed 
on to the western end of the “Maze.” Currently, 
eight fiendish stirges are taking advantage of the 
situation and draining the corpses dry.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises
Tactics: The fiendish stirges are busy feeding and are 
thus distracted (disadvantage on Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks). They do not notice any lantern/
torch light until it falls upon them. Although they 
are feeding, the fiendish stirges are not particularly 
thrilled with the quality of troglodyte blood and 
gladly welcome a chance to feast on something 
tastier, namely the PCs. 
Once the fiendish stirges spot the PCs, they take 
to the air to attack, spreading their numbers out as 
evenly as possible. Should the PCs gain surprise, 
they do not have time to mount a smart offensive 
and fight chaotically. 
The fiendish stirges, like the PCs, suffer from 
the troglodyte musk in the area and are consid-
ered poisoned.
Although the fiendish stirges are hungry they 
are not suicidal and any fiendish stirge reduced to 
one-half its hit points or fewer flies back to Room 
A30 and from there to the east, gladly leaving its 
fellows behind. If at any time the odds are even 
or there are more PCs than fiendish stirges, the 
remaining fiendish stirges flee.
Because the fiendish stirges have already been 
feeding on troglodyte corpses, they are not hungry 
and only drain 5 hit points each from the PCs. Once 
full, they fly off to digest their meals.
To complicate matters, one of the fiendish 
stirges is semi-translucent and is harder to hit. All 
stirges either sharing this stirge’s space or adjacent 
to it function like mirror images of the stirge. In 
addition, it is more connected to its fiendish energy 
and explodes with vile ichor and blood when killed, 
dealing 1d6 acid damage to all creatures within 5 ft.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the fiendish stirges be hungry enough to drain 
20 hit points from a victim. To decrease the chal-
lenge of this encounter, have each fiendish stirge 
only capable of draining 5 hit points from a victim.
A32 . TORTURE CHAMBER 
The door to Room A32 is trapped. Pulling the door 
open releases some inexplicable radiant energy 
located underneath it. The radiant energy expands 
from a holy sigil drawn on the floor just under the 
door. When the door is opened, the energy spreads, 
hurting everyone of evil intent.
The trap is reset when the door is closed. Nothing the 
PCs do can permanently disarm the trap.

53
 '
Radiant Energy Trap: Radiant light explodes out in a 60 
foot cone from the sigil, searing all those of non-good 
alignment. DC 15 Dexterity save to avoid. On a failed 
save, the creature takes 5d4 radiant damage and is 
blinded for 1 minute, or half damage on a success-
ful save and is not blinded.
Read the following once the PCs open the 
secret door.
This room belies the standard, featureless rooms 
of the Region. Something, or someone, has trans-
formed this large cell into a torture chamber. 
Several sets of wrist and ankle shackles are pinned 
into the stone walls. Dried pools of blood collect 
below each set, underlining the macabre nature of 
the room. Given the smell in the air, and the sheen 
to some of the pools of blood, it’s seen recent use. 
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was converted into a tor-
ture chamber over the years, though it is unclear 
who made this alteration and when. The shackles 
are crude, pinned into the wall with rough pig 
iron spikes. 
The Room has not been entered in some time. 
And while the hallway is subject to troglodyte musk, 
the Room itself is free of the odor. All of this may 
lead to questions from the PCs.
Tactics: Despite the atmosphere, the Room is an 
excellent place for the PCs to rest.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this trap, have 
the radiant energy damage all non-good characters. 
To decrease the challenge of this trap, have it reset 
after one hour.
A33-A34 . THE AMBUSH 
The following description covers the hallways and 
alcoves south of Room A33 including locations A 
and B. It also examines the tactics of the troglodytes 
defending the area. This is a complicated encoun-
ter. Remember the PCs, along with any other living 
non-troglodytes, are considered poisoned while in 
this area unless they have taken suitable precautions. 
Read the following carefully before proceeding.
Remember that the PCs, along with any other living 
non-troglodytes, are considered poisoned while in 
this area unless they have somehow managed to take 
precautions.
 
All four of the doors in this area are closed but not 
locked. 
 
The southern door is ajar. 
 
Having withstood the initial assault by the fiend-
ish darkmantles, the remaining troglodytes 
have prepared themselves as best as they can for 
subsequent attacks by placing six of their number 
in readiness for any additional threats (two each at 
location B and two behind the southern door).
Read the following text once the PCs near location A. 
Signs of battle are evident, as several of the flying 
octopus creatures have met their end in these hall-
ways. Their corpses have been cut open and their 
entrails line the floor. The smell of musk permeates 
the air, indicating someone must have escaped 
the fight.
Initial Attitude: Hostile (Initial) or Indifferent (after 
PCs retreat)
Encounter: Over a dozen fiendish darkmantle corpses 
have had their tentacles and bodies sliced open. The 
resulting mess of blood and organs makes the floor 
intentionally slippery. PCs moving through the area 
must succeed at a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw the 
moment they step into location A. Failure causes 
them to slip and fall prone in a bloody mess.
Even if a PC avoids slipping, the noise made by 
moving through the coagulated blood and squishy 
organs is overheard by the troglodytes hiding at 
location B unless the PCs take specific actions to 
avoid this.
Should the PCs attempt to move quietly, have 
them make DC16 Dexterity (Stealth) checks to see 
if they succeed. PCs using light sources (except 
for candles) are automatically detected before they 
reach location A. 
Two troglodyte warriors hide in the darkness in 
each alcove — east and west. These locations are 
marked with a “B”; both troglodytes occupy a single 
square). Although they blend in as well as they 
can, the fact is they have nowhere to hide and are 
thus easily spotted by anyone who looks into either 
alcove and succeeds at a DC 8 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check.
The remaining troglodytes hide behind the 
south door, ready to pounce. From here, they keep 

 54
an eye on the hallway. They are much harder to 
spot, requiring a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Given the tight quarters in this area, the 
troglodytes realize the importance of these alcoves. 
The moment they become aware of movement 
through location A, they ready themselves. Due to 
their desire for surprise, the troglodytes at location 
B cannot warn their compatriots hiding behind 
the door of the PCs moving in darkness (those not 
using light sources but making noise at location A); 
if those two do not hear the PCs then they cannot 
react during the surprise round. All troglodytes 
notice any light sources in the hallway.
Unless the PCs have a way of knowing where the 
troglodytes are, or are especially cautious, the trog-
lodytes gain one surprise round before initiative is 
rolled. The moment a PC enters the square be-
tween the two alcoves one of the troglodytes from 
each alcove takes a 5-ft. step and attacks with both 
troglodytes gaining a flanking advantage. The other 
troglodytes behind the door use the round to move 
down the hall (if they are not aware of the PCs 
when the troglodytes in the alcove attack then they 
cannot move until the first normal combat round), 
one behind the other, and hem the PC in position; 
they cannot attack until the following round.
Once combat begins, the troglodytes hold their 
positions with three of them engaging the PC 
caught between the alcoves (the two in the alcoves 
receiving flanking bonuses) and the other three 
providing backup for any troglodyte that falls. Al-
though they secrete their musk, the smell is already 
so bad that it has no further effect on the PCs.
Knowing that they are trapped, the troglodytes 
fight to the death. They do everything they can to 
stop the PCs from reaching the wounded in Room 
A34. Given the chance, the troglodytes push the 
PCs back onto the darkmantle corpses, knowing 
the ground is slippery. They flank without exposing 
themselves and go for deep leg wounds when pos-
sible. During the surprise round, consider giving 
the troglodytes sneak attack bonuses (1st level).
Given recent history, the troglodytes consider 
anyone that is not a troglodyte an enemy and attack 
to kill, giving no quarter. Any attempt to negotiate 
falls on deaf ears.
If the PCs retreat, the troglodytes do not pur-
sue, realizing they would be giving up a significant 
advantage by doing so. Since the rather desper-
ate troglodytes recognize that it was not orcs or 
beasts attacking them, allow a DC 16 Charisma 
(Persuasion) check if the PCs speak draconic (with 
advantage if no troglodytes were wounded or killed 
during the initial ambush), and attempt a parlay 
after retreating.
If Turag (from Room A28) is with the PCs and the 
troglodytes notice him, they demand to take him 
as a prisoner in exchange for information. Turag, 
of course, is against this plan but turns even more 
sniveling if the PCs appear to agree to an exchange. 
If Turag fought against the troglodytes, there is no 
chance of parley, and they focus their energies on 
killing the orc. The PCs are seen as allies and also 
dispatched without mercy. 
If parlay is successful, the PCs can speak to 
Yrkak, the troglodyte cleric from Room A34, though 
they are not past the alcoves. The lead troglodyte 
fetches him instead. The troglodytes share their 
own personal stories of the Region, but precious lit-
tle concerning Longtail and his plans. Yrkak recalls 
that when he last heard of Longtail the “rat-man’’ 
was heading to the east.
If the parley fails, the troglodytes leave the PCs 
alone as long as they do not return. In no way do 
the troglodytes join with the PCs. They are busy car-
ing for the wounded at the moment and enjoy their 
tactically sound position. Should the PCs render 
aid, they are most appreciative and offer them the 
acid flasks from Room A34.
Once the troglodyte warriors are healthy, the 
group attempts to leave the area. 
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
change two of the troglodytes to incensed berserk-
ers. Their claw and bite attacks do two addition-
al points of damage, and the first time they are 
reduced to 0 hit points, they make a Constitution 
saving throw. On a success, they stay standing with 
two hit points remaining. To decrease the challenge 
of this encounter, remove the two troglodytes 
behind the door. They are inside Room A34, and 
wounded instead.

A33 . TROGLODYTE LIVING 
QUARTERS
The door to this room, as are all the doors in this 
area, is open. 
Several troglodytes lie in a fetal position on reed 
mats, otherwise this room appears to be empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: There are a total of six dead troglodytes 
here, having been arranged in the proper burial 
positions by their cleric (see Room A34). There are no 
other living troglodytes in the Room. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A

Scaling: N/A
A34 . TROGLODYTE LIVING 
QUARTERS
The door to this room is open (as are all the doors in 
this section). 
Some badly wounded troglodytes lie on reed mats. 
Several others sit and sulk. One of them looks older 
and wiser, tending to the injured. In the south-
eastern corner is a collection of orc weapons, some 
armor, a pile of clothes, and a sack. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: There are a total of seven wounded 
troglodytes (hp 8, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0) within this Room. 
They are casualties of the fiendish darkmantle 
assault and are being tended to by Yrkak, a troglo-
dyte cleric.
Three of the wounded are incapacitated and at 0 
hit points, and the other four warriors are fatigued 
(2 levels of exhaustion, cannot use multi-attack) as a 
result of their recent action and wounds.
Note: If the PCs rest somewhere after the ambush 
before entering this Room, the troglodytes have 
had time to heal a little bit.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Yrkak is busy doing what he can for the 
wounded warriors and has already used his allot-
ment of spells to fight the fiendish darkmantles. If 
the PCs have killed the warriors in the hall, the trog-
lodytes see no chance for peace. The four wounded 
warriors engage the PCs immediately.
There is a chance for the PCs to negotiate here, 
but it is slim.
Yrkak kills the three disabled warriors (taking 
three rounds to perform the coups de grace), rather 
than having them fall into enemy hands. He makes 
a prayer to his god as he does, granting him advan-
tage on his next three die rolls after this. The mercy 
killings Yrkak carries out prove to be a mistake, 
however. In 1d4+1 turns, the dead warriors return 
to life as ghouls and proceed to attack the nearest 
target — whether troglodyte or PC. They’ve been 
inflicted with the same fiendish contamination as 
the orc the PCs might have encountered earlier. 
Should these ghouls somehow remain in the dun-
geon for a month or more, they gain the fiendish 
template as well.
Once Yrkak has finished with the three dis-
abled warriors, Yrkak joins any remaining war-
riors in combat, throwing the acid flasks at the 
strongest PCs. If the PCs have rested before en-
tering the room, he has his full complement of 
spells restored.

 56
Everyone fights to the death.
Treasure: Yrkak has an amber holy symbol of his god 
(100 gp) on a leather thong around his neck, a jav-
elin, a potion of healing (which he is saving for the 
worst), an oil flask, and 3 acid flasks.
The troglodytes have collected a number of scav-
enged items from some of the dead orcs. There are 
some suits of leather armor, some clubs, and axes. 
All of it is crudely made, but valuable in a pinch 
should the PCs be running low on supplies.
There’s also an orc pack that no one has gone 
through yet. It contains two bottles, 12 feet of 
scratchy rope, a halfling boot with a special lode-
stone inside, special wine in a wineskin, and a jar 
filled with toenails. The bottles contain a disgust-
ing alcoholic beverage that doubles as a cure light 
wounds potion. Drinking it requires a Con check 
(DC 14). If the PC fails, he throws up the contents 
and the potion is wasted. Otherwise, it works nor-
mally, but tastes horrible.
The lodestone compass always points north, 
except when around magical areas, in which case it 
just spins.
The wineskin is well made and looks custom. 
It contains a delicious human wine that was once 
worth roughly 100 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the wounded troglodytes be fully function-
al (they are still wounded but not exhausted) and 
increase their hit point totals by 4 each. In addition, 
Yrkak has not used his 2nd-level spell slots. To de-
crease the challenge of this encounter, make all the 
troglodytes exhausted and the disabled troglodytes 
don’t return to life.
A35 . OUTER CHAMBER 
This standard secret door is locked with a good lock 
(DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check) in the lower 
left corner of the door (DC 14 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check). The lock is part of the door and cannot 
be attacked separately. The door may only be locked 
or unlocked from the outside. Once the door is un-
locked, it may be opened in the usual manner. 
As you push open the door, a shriveled and partly 
clothed skeletal body falls into the passageway.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This is the body of an orc soldier, impris-
oned in this Room by his fellow soldiers when his 
madness overtook him. He ate most of his own 
flesh, as can be seen by the tusk marks etched into 
his bones. A broken sword lies next to the door, its 
blade snapped.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Propped into the southwestern corner is 
a broken repeating light crossbow, and a smashed 
hooded lantern (no oil).
Scaling: N/A
A36 . MAGAZINE 
The secret door is trapped to release a swinging block 
that hits anything within the doorway when the door 
is pushed open from Room A35. There are actually 
two such blocks, one for each side the door can be 
pushed in on. Only one can be triggered at a time 
due to the construction of the trigger mechanism 
which relies on the door opening into Room A36 
to operate. The hidden bolt bypass for each block is 
located just inside the door and using it requires that 
the door open slowly in order to access the locking 
mechanism just inside the doorframe. Pushing the 
door closed resets the trap. 
 '
Swinging Block Trap: +5 to hit one target. On a hit, 
deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage. DC 15 Wisdom 
(perception) check to find, DC 13 Dexterity (Thieves’ 
Tools) check to disarm.
Once the PCs open the door, read the following.
Several weapons, as well as barrels and cases, sit in 
a haphazard fashion within this room. They have 
clearly been ransacked, with most of the contents 
missing or strewn about the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was a storage Room for munitions 
and supplies. Orghur’s orcs have had their way with 
the contents; however, they left behind little.
Encounter Condition: Drafty, Extreme Cold, Safe
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: A small barrel of 88 crossbow bolts balances 
in one corner. Although there are racks to hold over 
20 polearms, currently only three spears are here. 
The cases have been smashed open and emptied of 

57
their contents. A small cask of oil (5 gallons) rests on 
top of the barrel.
Crumbled and wedged behind the barrel is a 
crude troglodyte tapestry. It is painted with various 
shades of blood and ichor, creating a monotone 
image of their tribe’s origin story: as the troglo-
dytes walk up from the divine river in a line, with 
the first bringing gifts to an already crowned king 
and queen. 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of the trap, 
raise the attack bonus of the trap to +8. To decrease 
the challenge of this trap, reduce the damage done 
by the stone block to 2d6.  
A37 - A40 . THE QUAD
Four large Rooms encompass A37 through A40, 
serving as ancient workshops. Although most of the 
tools are gone (having been taken by any number of 
humanoid races), the large furnaces and tables are 
still in place. 
Mostly empty, the area currently serves as a resting 
place for several fiendish beasts that have formed 
a convenient fellowship. Over the years, Achsyyx 
and other fiendish creatures have lured creatures 
here as food.
A37 . TOOLSMITH WORKSHOP 
The door to this Room is open and secured with a 
metal hook that holds the door in place, preventing it 
from accidentally closing.
 Several large workbenches are arranged in a 
haphazard fashion in this room. An unnatural light 
is cast across the floor and walls, with crooked 
shadows breaking the monotony. A familiar un-
ease sets in.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent or Hostile
Encounter: Fiendish darkmantles, rats, and stirg-
es have made their home here. The PCs can see 
from the doorway that the room is a nest for them, 
though it is unclear how many total monsters live 
here. Shadows and the scale of the Room make it 
difficult to discern what is what. This gives all of the 
creatures inside a huge advantage, as they can all 
see in darkness.
Roll 1d6 when the PCs enter the room to see the state 
of the creatures and the number present.

pounce from behind.
While their tactics are not complicated (see be-
low), the gang’s makeup determines what the PCs 
see and hear.
Five workbenches show signs of heavy use under 
layers of dust. Various tools lay about the workshop, 
all of them either broken or in poor repair.
Encounter Condition: Safe, Soft Cover
Tactics: Combined, the darkmantles, rats, and stirges 
are a formidable threat to any PCs not expecting a 
three-pronged attack from the darkness.
In general, the darkmantles cast the room 
into darkness, the stirges puff themselves up to 
look bigger before swooping down, and the rat 
swarms bite at the feet and legs of the PCs sur-
rounding them.

 58
The darkmantles fight cleverly and do not let 
themselves get hurt. If they do, they fly up to the 
ceiling and try to disappear into the darkness. The 
rat swarms fight to the death, having no sense of 
themselves as individuals. If the stirges are wound-
ed, they flee to one of the other workshops. All of 
them are opportunistic fighters, going after the 
weakest PCs.
Keep track of which monsters go where (Room 
A39 or Room A40). They may ambush or face off 
against the PCs again later.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the number of each monster by 1 and add 
two fiendish dire rats. To decrease the challenge of 
this encounter, reduce the number of each monster 
by 1 (minimum 1).
A38 . WEAPONSMITH WORKSHOP 
The door to this Room is open and secured with a 
metal spike that has been driven into the ground to 
prevent the door from being closed. A DC 15 Strength 
check is required to pull the spike out of the floor.
Several large workbenches are arranged in a 
haphazard fashion in this room. A large furnace 
sits unlit in the northeastern corner. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: There are a total of eleven workbenches in 
this Room, all of them dust-covered and showing 
signs of heavy use. The furnace is functional, but 
unless the PCs have fuel with them, it cannot be 
fired up. Various tools lay about the Room that, if 
gathered together, make a set and a half of artisan 
tools (weaponsmith).
Upon searching the Room, the PCs find words 
scrawled in common in the dust of one workbench. 
“Fire trap. Beware.” The message was written by a 
human adventure (Room A99), and refers to the 
burning hands trap in Room A46, though the PCs 
won’t know this.
If the PCs can find a way to secure the door, this 
is a safe place to rest.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Consider rolling for a random encounter 
when the PCs enter, but not while they rest.

A39 . DESTROYED WORKSHOP 
The door to this Room is open and secured with an 
iron spike that has been driven into the wall to pre-
vent it from being closed. A DC 15 Strength check is 
required to pull out the spike. 
The workbenches in this room have all been de-
stroyed; all that remains is a furnace resting in the 
southwestern corner.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Whoever cleaned out this Room de-
stroyed everything with a sledgehammer, including 
the furnace. The mess is just the right place for 
eight fiendish dire rats.
Creatures fleeing from Room A37 may be found 
here as well.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Conceal-
ment, Hazardous Footing 15
Tactics: The fiendish dire rats rummage through the 
morass in the Room, trying to put together a nest 
in the furnace from the choicest bits. Although they 
are busy, they are still animals chewing away at 
bugs and filth. Regardless, one of them is likely to 
have an eye on the door while the others eat. It does 
not matter which. Sneaking up on the dire rats is 
difficult, especially if the PCs use a light source.
Whether or not the dire rats gain surprise, the 
rodents spread out to limit how many PCs can get 
through the doorway. The rest take defensive posi-
tions. Although they are defending their newly won 
home, these rodents are not eager to die and will 
flee if three or more of their number are killed.
Somewhere along the northern wall is a hole in 
the wall the size of a small dog. The dire rats can 
fit through it, one at a time, if they need an escape 
route. They might also use this to get into the hall-
way and then around to the door.
Treasure: A thorough search of the rubble reveals 
a bone hand (species unknown) wearing a mag-
ical signet ring. The ring hums and glows when 
the wearer is hungry. Once it is worn, it cannot 
be removed, without a remove curse spell. The PCs 
also find a small leather sack that has been chewed 
through. A few silver coins are still inside the sack, 
though it cannot be repaired.

59
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add three fiendish dire rats. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, remove two fiendish 
dire rats.
A40 . DESTROYED LABORATORY
The door to this Room is partially open, hanging by 
one hinge as the result of the explosion that ripped 
through this laboratory. The door blocks passage for 
Medium creatures (although Small creatures can 
squeeze through) and requires a DC 15 Strength 
check to open fully.
This room was obviously devastated by an explo-
sion. Scorch marks score the walls and whatever 
furniture once adorned the place is in shards. Here 
and there you can make out what appears to be 
a table or the leg of a stool, but otherwise the 
destruction is complete. 
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was a laboratory that was destroyed 
during a failed experiment involving fire evocation. 
The entire laboratory was virtually vaporized and the 
door was knocked off its hinge. 
The entire floor is covered in slivers of wood, 
chunks of stone, pieces of glass, and bone shards 
that halves movement and give disadvantage on 
Stealth checks. All of the debris is scorched in some 
manner and the entire place still smells of the 
smoke from many years ago. The remnants of a 
furnace sit in the northwestern corner, the explo-
sion reducing it to little more than a pile of rubble 
about the height of a man’s knee. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The floor is covered in debris. Sifting 
through the trash takes hours to find anything. The 
furnace, despite its almost total destruction, is a 
more promising area to search and any PC that suc-
ceeds at a DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
finds a short sword that looks almost unmarked by 
the devastation. This is a +1 short sword that was be-
ing prepared to receive further enchantments when 
the research detonated.
GMs may allow the PCs to place one 1st-level 
enchantment or transmutation spell into the sword, 
completing the ritual. However, this requires a DC 
17 Intelligence (Arcana) check to figure out what 
they were doing, as well as a DC 20 Arcana check to 
complete the ritual.
If it succeeds, such a spell would be permanent-
ly infused into the blade. The spell is then stored 
inside the blade to be cast once per day as a 1st-lev-
el wizard might cast the spell. Sleep, for instance, 
could be cast once per day by the sword, regardless 
of who wielded it.
Gamemasters may find this ability too powerful 
and instead give it 20 charges, in which case the 
spell eventually ends.
Scaling: N/A
A41 .-A45 . KOBOLD STRONGHOLD
Rooms A41 through A45 mark the borders of a kobold 
stronghold. This area was the first target of the orc’s 
assault. As the battle in this area reached its climax, 
a wave of extraplanar beasts joined the fray. Even a 
last-second alliance between the kobolds and orcs 
could not stop the onslaught. Currently a number of 
fiendish giant beetles and snake swarms explore the 
area, looking for scraps and nesting places.
Note: The fiendish giant beetles and snakes work 
together right now because there is enough food to 
go around. As soon as the food is gone, they will turn 
on each other.
Also Note: After Room A45, it is quite possible for 
the PCs to make navigation choices leading them 
north to Region E. If the characters choose to head in 
that direction, make sure the PCs have some means 
of reaching level 4. Whatever you need to do. Place 
a secret door map in between and let the PCs gain 
some XP, or just have them wake from a rest with 
an additional level, if needed. Alternatively, let them 
experience the first encounter in Region E and flee 
when it becomes clear they’re outmatched. 
Because this is the only area where fiendish beetles 
and snakes are found, it has its own random en-
counter chart.

1
The sound of nearby heavy breathing and 
panting is followed by a distant howl. When 
rolled again, the howl gets closer.
2
A dead kobold or orc lies in the hallway, 
recently murdered and chewed upon by 
rats... or something else. But the body 
wasn’t fully consumed. Why? When rolled 
again, the face and hands are the only parts 
that have been eaten.
3 – 8
Nothing. When rolled again, add +1 to the 
roll. This bonus is cumulative.
9–13
A swarm of writhing fiendish snakes 
approaches, turns, and disappears into the 
darkness. When rolled again, the snakes 
turn into smoke and evaporate.
14–16
Two fiendish giant beetles feed on the 
remains of a fiendish darkmantle. They stop 
eating once the PCs approach. When rolled 
again, there is an additional beetle, but they 
feed on something else from the area. This 
effect is cumulative.
17–20The PCs stumble upon an illusion.
A41 . KOBOLD GUARD POST 
The door to this Room is open and damaged.
Two dead orcs and four dead kobolds lay amidst an 
overturned table and broken stools. The bodies have 
started to decompose, their features gnawed upon. 
Their faces are unrecognizable and most of the 
fingers are gone.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This was a guardpost for the kobolds that 
occupied this area. The guards here were tasked 
with guarding the approach of anything from the 
“Maze:’ Breaking through the kobold defenses in 
Room A45, Orghar sent a squad of orcs through the 
western tunnel to deal with them. The corpses that 
lay here are the result of that skirmish.
Currently, three fiendish giant scarab beetles 
scurry along the floor and walls, feeding upon 
the bodies.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The fiendish beetles take a defensive stance, 
but do not immediately attack. The PCs may or may 
not recognize their behavior as a bluff. If not, allow 
them to make a DC 10 Wisdom (Nature) check to 
understand the situation. The fiendish beetles are 
not interested in combat and, if the PCs leave them 
alone, the beetles continue to feed without incident.
If the PCs attack, the fiendish beetles try to 
flee back to Room A44. If necessary, they fight to 
the death, but they would prefer to look for open-
ings to flee.
Treasure: Other than the standard arms and armor 
and the table and stools, one of the kobolds has 
some gold wire (5 gp) wrapped decoratively about 
his horns. In addition, there is an ordinary dagger 
driven into the tabletop with an agate in its pom-
mel (15 gp). 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
double the number of fiendish beetles and have 
them attack the PCs rather than flee. To decrease 
the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish 
beetles flee the moment they detect the PCs.
A42 . KOBOLD LIVING AREA 
The door to this Room is broken and off its hing-
es. Some kind of battering ram was used to break 
in the door.
Nearly a dozen orc and kobold bodies lie in this 
room along with a couple of the flying octopus 

61
creatures. The bar behind the door has been 
snapped in two and lies on the ground. Stools, reed 
mats, and blankets are strewn over the place along 
with what were probably the personal possessions 
of the kobolds who made this their home.
Initial Attitude: Hostile/Unfriendly 
Encounter: The kobolds and orcs fighting in this 
Room were surprised and overwhelmed by the wave 
of fiendish snakes that rolled through the area. 
And although the kobolds and orcs quickly banded 
together, it was too late.
Currently, two swarms of fiendish snake swarms 
pick out the choicest morsels among the numerous 
corpses, though the PCs would see it as one mas-
sive writhing mass of snakes. There are other snake 
swarms in the area, all of them getting their fill of 
the meat that comes off the corpses the easiest.
Some of the bigger snakes push through orifices 
and hollow portions of the torsos. They even feed 
on some of the dead darkmantles. The rhythmic 
consumption of flesh continues unabated, unless 
the PCs intervene.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Dis-
tracting Noises
Tactics: The fiendish snake swarm knows there are 
more snakes in the area. 
If the PCs attack, or get too close, one fiendish 
snake swarm flees to Room A44, leading the PCs 
past the fiendish rat swarms active there if they are 
able. If not, they fight and hope to force an opening 
that will allow them to flee. Only if no other option 
exists do they fight to the death. 
The sounds of combat attract the attention of 
the fiendish snake swarms in Room A44, and they 
rush to investigate the noise. They arrive in 1d3+1 
rounds with the other swarm.
If the PCs keep their distance, the swarms keep 
a wary eye on the PCs, but eventually return to 
feeding. Should the PCs get too close, though, 
fighting begins.
Note: There is only one entrance/exit in the Room. 
If the swarms intend to flee or get help, they must 
squirm past the PCs. Conversely, the GM can add 
holes in the walls big enough for the swarms to 
pass through and into the hall.
Treasure: Aside from several small stools and a dozen 
reed mats and blankets, the personal possessions of 
the kobolds have been strewn over the floor. They 
hold no value to the swarm and have been pushed 
aside. Some of it may have even been swallowed by 
the snakes.
PCs require a thorough Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check (DC 16) to locate any of the following 
items among the general litter and bodies — a 
kobold sized flute carved from a small thighbone 
(2 gp); a set of 26 polished stone playing pieces 
and game board (4 gp) stolen from a caravan; a 
tarnished, silver drinking cup with a dwarven in-
scription stating “Gretta’s Cup” (5 gp); a set of nine 
rough carvings made from ivory depicting various 
swamp denizens (17 gp total value); several of the 
kobolds are wearing horn coverings made of gold 
(in the shape of a cylinder and worth 3 gp each; a 
total of 8); eleven gems of low value (10 gp each) 
found in the pouches of three kobolds. 
Searching for treasure can leave the PCs dis-
tracted (disadvantage on Perception checks) during 
the arrival of the fiendish snake swarms from 
Room A44. 
Scaling: To increase the challenge, have the fiend-
ish snake swarms attack the PCs the moment they 
enter. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, 
have both swarms flee to Room A44 as soon as the 
PCs arrive.
A43 . KOBOLD CHIEF'S  
LIVING AREA
The door to this Room is open. 
The smell of blood in this room is close to over-
whelming. Kobold and orc dead, along with an 
almost equal number of the flying octopus crea-
tures, lie strewn about the room. A couple of large 
feline bodies can be identified in one of the corners. 
A small sea of drying blood coats the floor like a 
torn carpet.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was Borryn’s, the kobold chief ’s 
quarters and it was here that the battle between the 
orcs and kobolds reached its climax. Even as both 
sides inflicted heavy casualties on each other, the 
fiendish darkmantles fell on them and a three-way 
battle was joined during which all the humanoids, 
including Borryn perished. Their hasty alliance 

 62
managed to inflict some serious casualties on the 
fiendish darkmantles, leaving room for the fiendish 
snake swarms to move in.
So thick is the carnage in this Room that any 
creature moving across the sticky floor must suc-
ceed at a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw every time 
they move more than 5 ft. on a turn or fall prone 
among the viscera (disadvantage on Stealth checks 
due to the noise made when moving through the 
sticky blood). PCs who fall are partially coated with 
blood and gore. Given the carnage in the place, 
not even the fiendish dire rats have ventured 
into the Room.
Because of the massive carnage, it is impossible 
to tell what the Room once contained. A broken 
table, along with seven small stools, are scattered 
throughout the area, as are ten reed mats and at-
tendant blankets. The remaining items, mostly ko-
bold personal items that had been stored in sacks, 
are scattered about the Room amongst the bodies. 
Encounter Condition: Decrepit, Hazardous 
Footing 15
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The sheer damage done to the area and 
the sheer mess makes locating any small valuable 
items a chancy proposition; the bodies still have 
their usual arms and armaments. Most items are 
crushed or so drenched in blood that they are 
almost unrecognizable. Still, determined PCs may 
search (DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check) for 
the following items - a silver ring set with a moon-
stone on an orc’s hand (105 gp); six sets of the gold 
kobold horn caps (5 gp per each cap for a total of 60 
gp); an electrum earring in a kobolds ear (3 gp); a 
spear that lays near Borryn; a blue coral necklace (6 
gp) torn from the neck of an orc; a gold pendant in 
the shape of a tree (25 gp) around a kobolds throat; 
a pair of fine leather boots (50 gp) on the feet 
of an orc. 
An additional item of interest is a large chest sit-
uated in the southwestern corner of the Room that 
has an orc corpse slumped across it. This was the 
kobold chieftain’s personal chest and is locked with 
an average lock (DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools)); it 
is not trapped. It contains a bolt of purple silk (10 
square yards; 100 gp), a plain gold circlet (25 gp), 
five sacks of copper pieces (523 cp total), two sacks 
of silver pieces (147 sp total), one sack of gold pieces 
(92 gp total), a small pouch of platinum pieces (17 
pp total), and two pouches of gems (21 total gems 
of 4d4 gp in value). 
Note that searching for treasure can leave the 
PCs distracted (disadvantage on Perception checks) 
during the arrival of the fiendish rat swarms from 
Room A44. 
Scaling: N/A
A44 . KRENSHAR STABLES 
Both doors to this area are open. To the west is an 
opening devoid of a door.
This description assumes the PCs approach from 
the west. If they enter the Room from the southeast, 
ignore the “devoid of bodies” line.
This open area is divided by several walls into 
smaller individual spaces. The ceiling is extremely 
high as well, disappearing into the darkness. Straw 
is scattered across the floor, with animal dung 
throughout. The area is eerily devoid of bodies 
given the carnage in other rooms, though the 
smell of death is present. The sounds of something 
ominous can be heard around one of the many 
dividing walls.
Note: This is a complicated encounter.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Currently, there are a number of fiendish 
creatures in the Room, keeping to their respective 
places but on the verge of attack.
Two fiendish snake swarms wait in the north-
eastern corner for the fiendish rat swarms to leave 
the near center of the Room. Meanwhile, three 
fiendish darkmantles cling to the ceiling, some 80 
feet in the air.
This Room was used by the kobolds to stable 
their krenshar mounts. The kobold and mounts 
attempted to hold this area in the face of the orc 
onslaught but succeeded only in getting killed. 
Bloated maggots and pus-filled centipedes feed on 
the corpses, especially since the rats and snakes are 
waiting to feed. 
These waves followed a fiendish darkmantle 
swarm that had been released by Longtail and 
came to this Room directly from Room A108 via the 
one-way secret door in the western wall (see Room 
A108 for a complete description). Although the PCs 

63
may well decide to explore the eastern hallway, the 
nature of the secret door to Room A108 prevents 
them from entering Longtail’s chapel (unless they 
have the tools to chip through solid rock).
Should the PCs investigate, they will find two 
dead krenshar, one in the northwestern portion and 
the other in the southeastern portion, and two dead 
kobolds in the doorways in the corner. It is possible 
the PCs have never seen anything like these crea-
tures before. They look like deranged cat wolves 
without ears and spikey hair.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: All three groups are on constant guard 
against one another. They’ve been locked in a stale-
mate for days, waiting for the other to make a mis-
take. The presence of the PCs throws this balance 
into disarray, though. Some of the creatures will 
turn on the PCs, and some will turn on each other.
If the snake swarm from Room A42 has already 
summoned the snake swarms here, they are gone 
and the rat swarms have scattered to various cor-
ners of the Room. In this case, the PCs are left to 
face the rats and darkmantles at the same time.
If the snakes haven’t fled, or there are more 
snakes here from Room A42, the rat and snake 
swarms turn on one another, though some turn on 
the PCs as well. Should the PCs try to take advan-
tage of the infighting, the swarms stop fighting one 
another and fight the PCs.
The fiendish darkmantles wait for the perfect op-
portunity to ambush anything that moves, whoever 
is weakest.
In all, this encounter is an orgy of violence that 
should consume a lot of PC resources.
To make matters worse, Longtail may send 
Achsyyx from Room A103 if he hears the commo-
tion. If the PCs are 3rd level or higher, there is a 3 
in 20 chance for Achsyyx to appear after the combat 
is over. Additionally, there is a 1 in 20 chance that 
Longtail is with him. See Rooms A103 and A104. If 
they do arrive, however, they are likely to fall back to 
a safe position after a few rounds of fighting. They 
are only here as a scouting operation.
Additionally, the fight may proceed long enough 
to draw a random encounter.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge, add one more 
fiendish rat swarm and one more fiendish dark-
mantle. To decrease the challenge of this encoun-
ter, remove all of the fiendish darkmantles, but 
give the PCs the impression that something could 
be up there.
A45 . BARRICADED HALLWAY 
All the doors in and out of this hallway are open and 
partially damaged. They will never lock again. 
The bones of two large felines and a pair of kobolds 
are strewn about the hallway. Their clothing is torn. 
Rat carcasses litter the hallway as well. Centipedes 
and worms burrow through the remains. Makeshift 
barricades and battlements are nothing but splin-
tered wood now. But what was once an important 
front line is nothing now.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Protruding from the skull of the larger 
kobold is a crude, oversized knitting needle. It was 
improvised as a weapon during the fight by an orc 
and left there. The kobold weapons were stolen and 
taken back with the surviving orcs.
This Room was under constant patrol and de-
fense by two kobolds and two krenshars when the 
orcs attacked. Arriving simultaneously from both 
the east and west, the orcs slaughtered the kobold 
guards, sustaining no casualties themselves and 
leaving the bodies as a message to the others. The 
fiendish rat swarms came to feed on what re-
mained, having their way with the corpses, but they 
too died when orcs returned to retrieve their dead.
Now, maggots and vile-looking centipedes 
worm through the flesh of the dead, just like in 
Room A44.

A46-A56 . NO MAN'S LAND
Covering Rooms A46 through A56, this core portion 
of the Region was not claimed by the orcs or rep-
tilians and served as neutral ground — when the 
alliance was held. It was simply a pragmatic matter to 
deem the area free of hostilities, lest everyone perpet-
ually have knives to their figurative throats. 
Although some parts of the area did see heavy 
fighting — no treaty is perfect — large parts of this 
area were left alone for a long time. A number of un-
discovered secrets, traps, and treasures remain.
A46 . WORKSHOP 
The western door to this room is locked, but simple 
enough to pick, or break open with a DC 16 Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) or Strength (Athletics) check. 
The southeastern door to this room is closed and 
trapped. Draconic writing on the door reads “Dan-
ger. Do Not Enter.” The doorway is trapped with an 
automatically resetting burning hands trap. The trap 
activates the moment any creature opens the door to 
Room A46. It shoots down from the ceiling in a cone 
shape, striking the square in front of the door on 
both sides. Because the vent is built into the archway, 
this trap is nearly impossible to spot. 
 '
Burning Hands Trap. Deals 3d6 fire damage in a 
15-foot cone. Creatures take half damage on a 
successful DC 8 Dexterity saving throw. DC 25 Wis-
dom (perception) check to find, DC 16 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check to disarm. Automatically resets when 
the door closes.
Read the following once the PCs open the door.
Although this room is now empty, you can all but 
guess at its previous purpose. A complete forge 
sits in one corner. A large workbench, along with 
two stools, dominates the center, while there are 
numerous hooks and nails on the wall, indicating a 
place where tools were once kept. A hallway leads 
on past this area.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was at one time a workshop. The 
place was cleaned out, but the forge couldn’t be 
moved. Although covered with dust, the forge is 
still functional if fuel is found.
There is a 3 in 20 chance of finding a fiendish 
fire mephit trapped in the furnace.  Silver-inscribed 
runes keep the mephit here. If the runes are bro-
ken, cracked, or somehow erased, the mephit es-
capes or returns to its home plane (GM’s choice). If 
the fire mephit is antagonized with water or liquids, 
it erupts in a ball of expansive flame, much like the 
trap in this Room.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: Assuming the PCs survive the trap or bypass 
it, this is an excellent Room to rest. 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the trap damage to 5d6, and the likelihood 
of a fiendish fire mephit being present to 7 in 20. 
To decrease the challenge of this encounter, reduce 
the trap damage to 2d6, and allow the fiendish fire 
mephit to grant one minor boon if it is freed.
A47 . LABORATORY
Several tables are pushed up along the sides of this 
room, along with a trio of stools. 
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was a magical laboratory. Unlike the 
one in Room A40, this one did not sustain any ma-
jor damage. The valuable equipment was cleaned 
out, but a couple of items were left behind. 
PCs examining the tables can note discoloration 
and burn marks from the use of various chemicals 
during the experiments. A DC 10 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) check of the Room reveals several piles 
of glass shards from broken beakers and contain-
ers. Bare-foot creatures have avoided the Room for 
this very reason.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises or Haunted
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: A PC willing to search (DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check) through the glass shards is 
rewarded with a small, flawed diamond (500 gp).

65
More importantly, the owner of the lab created 
three hiding places for some of his lesser creations.
The first is a small metal box, about 4 inches in 
length, 4 inches in width, and 2 inches in height, 
that attaches under one of the tables and is found 
relatively easily with a DC 11 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check. 
This box is trapped with a poison blade holding 
greenblood oil weakened with age. The razor-sharp 
blade releases when the box is opened, slicing 
across the box opening and cutting into flesh. A 
PC that shakes the box hears small objects rattling 
within. Unfortunately, this box is a red herring and 
contains only a few pebbles. 
 '
Poison Blade Trap. +7 to hit, one target within 20 
ft. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage 
and must succeed on a DC 8 Constitution saving 
throw or suffer 1 point of Constitution damage for 
24 hours. A creature immune to poison is immune 
to this effect. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check 
to find, DC 11 Dexterity (Thieves’ Yools) check 
to disarm.
A second hiding place is behind one of the rocks 
of the furnace. The mechanism is actually a flat 
piece of rock attached to a metal flap that is lifted 
to gain access to the space behind; it is revealed 
by a more difficult DC 18 Investigation check. This 
hiding place is also guarded by a spring-loaded 
punching dagger blade that flies out the moment 
the rock flap is lifted, punching itself into the face 
or chest of the person opening the door. The blade 
is coated with greenblood oil that has lost much of 
its potency. 
 '
Punching Dagger Trap. +7 to hit one target. On a 
hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage and must 
succeed on a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or 
suffer 1 point of Constitution damage for 24 hours. 
A creature immune to poison is immune to this 
effect. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 
11 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to disarm.
Located in the hollow space behind the mech-
anism are three arcane scrolls — magic missile, 
guidance, and flaming sphere. 
The final location is the most difficult to find 
(DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check) and is 
actually a hollow stool leg that contains a wand of 
acid arrow (17 charges). The wand gives no clue as to 
its function and identify only reveals the command 
word (bahris-kyh). If the PCs detect magic, the wand 
radiates magic, but no school can be discovered.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
restore the potency of the greenblood oil poison. To 
reduce the challenge, remove the poison.
A48 . COLLAPSING  
ENERGY FIELD 
The door to this area is closed and has draconic writ-
ing on it that warns “Danger. Do Not Enter.”
A large, shimmering ruby-red crystal about the 
height of a human floats in the center of the cham-
ber some three feet off the ground. The ever-present 
energy of both good and evil can be felt stepping 
into the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The ruby red crystal is the remnant of 
an energy field that once held a minor devil. It lost 
its primary function when the fiend escaped, but 
it still has enough energy to be dangerous should 
any person or object disturb its surface. The kobolds 
never touched it, sensing something dangerous 
about the stone.
The shimmering is actually a result of the slow 
ebbing of the field’s energy. Disturbing the energy 
field’s surface in a physical manner, be it through 
touch, using a pole, throwing a stone, etc., caus-
es the protective field to collapse in on itself and 
release the remaining energy in a 20 ft. radius all 
around the ruby. This release causes 3d4 points of 
force damage to all within the radius. Those caught 
in the blast can attempt a DC 12 Dexterity saving 
throw to take only half damage. There is no way to 
disarm the energy field. 
Encounter Condition: Drafty, Safe (if the PCs leave 
the ruby alone)
Tactics: The first time a PC speaks within earshot of 
the crystal, a devilish laugh echoes off the energy 
field. The sound pierces through the quiet of the 
area, alerting all the nearby Rooms that some-
one is here.
Treasure: N/A 

 66
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the force damage to 4d6. To decrease 
the challenge of this encounter, reduce the force 
damage to 2d4 and the radius to 15 ft.
A49 . THE LONG HALLWAY 
All the doors leading into this hallway are open. 
The length of this room extends beyond the edge 
of your light source. Here lies an orc corpse, there 
rests a dead kobold, and over there, a flying octo-
pus, with three of its tentacles severed, lies limp 
against the wall. Bones and other bits against 
another wall. The lengthy chamber is a miasma of 
corpses and debris. Scuffles have obviously been 
happening here for a while.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The key to controlling Region A lies in 
controlling this hallway, as it affords access to the 
rest of the dungeon. Orghar made it one of his key 
objectives when planning the orc assault. Although 
they were officially neutral, the kobolds realized the 
significance of this hallway, as well, and always kept 
a guard force nearby. Although numerically supe-
rior, the orcs had difficulty controlling the hallway 
due to the presence of Boyikt, a kobold wizard, and 
his brother Borryn. However, as with the battle in 
the kobold stronghold (Rooms A41 through A45), 
the sudden appearance of extraplanar beasts ended 
the fight in a way neither side anticipated.
Numerous dead lie in the hallway, including 
orcs, kobolds, a couple of krenshar, fiendish stirges, 
fiendish darkmantles, and even some fiendish dire 
rats (exact numbers up to the GM). Otherwise, the 
hall is strangely empty.
The smell is nearly as bad as the musk in the 
northwest corner of the region.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Given the importance of this place and the 
numerous paths for access, the GM should roll 
for Random Encounters while the PCs are in the 
Room. One roll when the PCs enter and another 
just before they leave is ideal, although there can 
certainly be more.
These encounters need not be hostile, though 
some creatures will be shocked to see humans 
(and their ilk) in the dungeon. Some might even 
have questions.

A50 . KOBOLD GUARD POST 
The doors to this Room are open. 
Shackled to the wall in the southwestern corner is 
the skeleton of a kobold, standing over a reddish 
and green slime. The skeleton moves and twitches, 
kicking harder when someone approaches, but it is 
no use. The slime bubbles and gurgles, mimicking 
the pattern of your footsteps. 
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Although neutral by agreement, the 
kobolds kept a regular group of guards here. When 
the orcs attacked, the guards joined the battle in the 
hallway (Room A49).
Both the skeleton and slime radiate necro-
mantic magic.
Boyikt used his magic to turn some of the dead 
kobolds into skeletal warriors to join the fight. This 
one refused to stay down and they had to shackle 
it to the wall. The slime at his feet is the brain his 
skull once housed, now dissolved into a bloody goo. 

67
Should anyone cast dispel magic onto the brain, it 
returns to the shape of a kobold brain.
PCs investigating the Room have a chance to 
spot a metal plate trigger in the floor at the north-
west corner. When pressure is applied and kept on 
the plate, a loud click can be heard. When pressure 
is released, the click is heard again. This turns off 
and turns on the hallucination trap in Room A97. 
It wouldn’t take more than a few pounds of weight 
on the plate to keep the trap turned off. PCs won’t 
know what it goes to, but they will know it does 
something.

A51 . "THE COFFIN"
The door to this Room is closed. The smell here 
is as bad as the musk in the northwest corner of 
the Region.
Several skeletons of varying sizes lie about the 
room, rags hanging off their bones. The smell is 
almost unbearable, forcing you to cover your nose.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Given the Room’s isolation, it is ideal for 
body disposal. All manner of humanoid and beast 
has been thrown here over the centuries creating a 
distinct pile of bones and rotting flesh.
A large stone grind wheel has been turned over, 
but closer inspection shows it was used to grind 
bone years ago. Rust and decay have rendered it 
less than useful.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: There is a 1 in 20 chance of encountering a 
pair of kobolds or orcs disposing of a body while 
the PCs are present. They are not ready for a fight 
and may just want to step away, unless the PCs 
press for combat. There is an additional 1 in 20 
chance of a fiendish rat swarm having a meal. If 
neither of those events happens, there is a 3 in 20 
chance of a fiendish snake swarm present in the 
body pile, though it finds no need to attack unless 
necessary. There is plenty to eat.
Treasure: Some bone dust lies on the ground. 
Enough can be gathered to be used to create pro-
tection circles and the like as a powerful material 
component. A DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
reveals this information to a wizard or warlock. If it 
is used in this manner, it doubles the duration of 
the protection circle.

A52 . SECRET THRONE ROOM
The door to this Room is open. 
This large room has a simple throne carved from 
stone situated near the eastern end. Bits of chain 
and iron rings hammered into stone unleash a 
sense of dread. The taste and smell of something 
fiendish permeates the air. The sounds of groans 
and soft crying can be heard, but no one is there. It 
is as though the walls themselves are in pain.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: It is unclear who altered this Room and 
used it for evil, but minions were tortured here for 
the viewing pleasure of whosoever sat upon the 
throne. Sharp-eyed PCs can pick out numerous 
large rust-red stains on the floor (DC 14 Wisdom 
(Perception) check), the blood of those exe-
cuted here.
The throne is non-descript, having an almost 
alien appearance to the thrones of human kings. It 
has been hewn from a single piece of rock — just 
the right size for a dwarf or similar-sized creature. 
Two red gems are cut into the backrest, like eyes 
staring back at the PCs. Shadowy forms inside 
the gems enhance the creepiness of a parei-
dolic headrest.
There is a definite unease about this cursed 
throne. The vile deeds perpetuated by its owner 
have warped the stone into something evil and 
hateful. Any living creature who touches the throne 
is subject to the curse and must succeed at a DC 14 
Wisdom saving throw (rolled in secret by the GM). 
If the save fails, the cursed creature is afflicted with 
confusion but does not notice the change. If the 
save is made, the PC is still cursed but aware that 
something strange has taken place.
The PC is not aware of the curse at first and acts 
outwardly normal. However, anytime the PC is in a 

 68
stressful situation, such as combat or trying to per-
form a skill check quickly, the confusion surfaces.
Roll on the following table the first round that a 
PC is confused.
D20BeHavior
1-5
Attack the nearest ally (for this purpose, a 
familiar counts as part of the subject’s self )
6-7
Become nauseated (unable to attack, cast 
spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything 
else requiring attention. The only action 
such a creature can take is a single move 
action per turn)
8-13
Cower (take no actions, –2 penalty to Armor 
Class and loses his Dexterity bonus)
14-18
Flee away from the area at the top pos-
sible speed
19-20
Twitch uncontrollably (–2 penalty on attack 
rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and 
ability checks)
The confused condition passes the moment im-
mediately thereafter or when a stressful situation 
passes. Note that the curse can afflict any number 
of creatures and can be countered just like the spell 
bestow curse.
Otherwise, the curse lasts for a number of days 
equal to 16 minus the PCs Wisdom score at the time 
of the curse (minimum two days).
The painful sounds emanating in the room grow 
louder the longer the PCs remain. Tormented spirits, 
though not manifesting as threats, still live within the 
blood, chains, and walls. They will remain here forever 
until a cleric or other holy person casts a spell that 
can release them. Even something as simple as bless 
might do it.
PCs who get too close to the chains and iron rings 
find themselves grappling with animated chains. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the Wisdom saving throw DC to 17. To re-
duce the challenge of this encounter, the curse lasts 
only one day.
A53 . WESTERN GALLERY
Rooms A53 and A54 share the space, though encoun-
ters are slightly different.
The southern door in the hallway is open. Read the 
following description once the PCs have moved down 
the hall and turned west. 
A number of skeletons from a range of creatures 
hang on the walls spaced equally apart, iron spikes 
visible below their bones. More bones dot the floor, 
spread out and broken.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: After the demons broke out, hundreds of 
years ago, they took over portions of the dungeon 
in a mad orgy of violence. For a time, Room A53 
served as a “gallery of torture.” During its time, the 
walls held the mounted corpses of a number of 
creatures from drow to duergar and every human-
oid in between. Since then, time has reduced the 
corpses to skeletons making it more difficult to 
identify the individual species of each.
The exact composition of the bodies is up to 
the GM; any humanoid up to Large size is present. 
Given the limited encounters that the PCs of levels 
1 to 3 have had with humanoids, they probably can’t 
identify the various creatures, although such things 
as an ogre, an orc, a dwarf, an elf, a halfling, etc. 
might be familiar.
Once complete, a number of the skeletons are 
missing such things as a head, an arm, a leg, etc. 
Casting animate dead on these bones produces truly 
disturbing skeletons.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions or Haunted
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: Some personal effects might be found 
among the bones, but nothing of immediate value. 
Bracelets, rings, dull knives, earrings, costume 
jewelry, and combs (for instance) are among the 
various items strewn around the room.

A54 . EASTERN GALLERY
Rooms A53 and A54 share the space, though encoun-
ters are slightly different.
The southern door in the hallway is open. Read the 
following description once the PCs have moved down 
the hall and turned east. 
A number of skeletons from different creatures 
hang on the walls spaced equally apart, iron spikes 
visible below their bones. More bones dot the floor, 
spread out and broken.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Identical to Room A53 in shape, this 
Room houses the more unusual skeletons of the 
collection, such as mummified lamia, and the 
rotted carcass of a two-headed wolf-dog-creature 
(exact composition is up to the GM) all mounted on 
iron spikes.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises or Haunted
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: A half-suit of bone armor hangs from an 
iron peg. It is made for a larger-than-average hu-
man but provides armor protection like chain mail.

A55 . GUARD ROOM 
The door to this Room is closed.
Pieces of broken furniture and a dirty floor indicate 
someone once lived here. A single broken bed lies 
near the center of the room. Rubble and rags have 
been piled up in the northeastern corner. The smell 
of unwashed feet and disgusting food linger in the 
air. One can almost imagine orcs still living in here.
Initial Attitude: Varies 
Encounter: Behind the rubble is a near-dead orc (1 
hp), who was left behind during the last retreat 
through here. The other orcs assumed he was dead 
when he didn’t respond. Rather than leave their 
friend out in the open, they left him behind the 
rubble. They took his weapons and personal effects, 
however, leaving him with pants and boots.
How he escaped the notice of the fiendish crea-
tures nearby is anyone’s guess.
The orc has numerous wounds and a dented 
skull. If the PCs are able to heal him and bring him 
back, he has amnesia. He doesn’t even know his 
own name. He does not speak Common and may 
not be able to communicate with the PCs. The orc 
will not join the PCs and will run the first chance 
he gets. If forced to help, he will pretend to be an 
ally before running into the dungeon when they are 
not watching.
Stats are not provided for this orc. If the PCs 
choose to kill him, the fight is over quickly.
Encounter Condition: Deep Darkness
Tactics: Four rounds after the PCs have been in the 
Room, four hungry fiendish darkmantles enter 
looking for a quick meal. They immediately turn 
the Room dark with their aura and then descend 
to feed. They fight desperately and to the death in 
some depraved fashion. They make hungry, gnash-
ing noises that impart disadvantage to the PCs 
during the first round of combat. 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the orc turn on one of the PCs in a fit of fear 
and panic. He tries to steal an item and run away 
with it or bash someone from behind with a rock. 
To reduce the challenge of this encounter, reduce 
the number of fiendish darkmantles to three.
A56 . GUARD ROOM
The door to this Room is closed.
A broken table lies upturned against one wall, while 
a heavy wooden chest leans against the table. The 
walls and floors are non-descript, though there are 
dozens of tally marks cut into one wall. Along the 
floor are various, tiny torn pieces of paper.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room served as the home of a guard 
captain, but any functioning furniture was cleaned 
out during a regroup and retreat. The table was left 
alone as it had no value. The chest was left because 
it holds a special trap.
The chest contains a silver dagger wrapped in 
the skin of a darkmantle. The skin has been care-
fully cut from the organs, stretched, and made into 
a wrap, or small cloak. It’s unclear of its intend-
ed purpose.

 70
 Once the skin is unraveled a glyph of warding 
is exposed. The glyph of warding (explosive runes) 
affects only the character holding the skin, dealing 
5d8 lightning damage and forcing the character 
to scream in pain. A successful DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw halves the damage and the character 
does not scream. The dagger is not affected by the 
spell.wwwScattered on the floor are tiny shreds 
of paper, perhaps from a journal or log. Whatever 
was written on them was in another language, and 
few full words remain. PCs may attempt to piece 
it together, revealing a kobold letter detailing the 
mind-numbing work of being a guard.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: N/A

increase the saving throw DC of glyph of warning 
by 2. To decrease the challenge of this encounter,

A57-A77 . EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE
Both the reptilians and orcs avoid the area covering 
Rooms A57 through A77 and the hallways in between. 
Almost destroyed in the heavy earthquakes that dam-
aged the entire complex, the area is unstable. Chunks 
of the ceiling lay everywhere, making it an easy place 
to hide in but a difficult place to maneuver through. 
When the occasional tremor rumbles through this 
portion of the complex, it causes more dust, dirt, and 
rocks to fall from the ceiling, giving the entire area a 
sense of imminent annihilation; no creature willingly 
makes its home here. 
That is not to say that there are not currently some 
residents. Extraplanar scavengers roam the area hop-
ing to find an easy meal. A handful of reptilian refu-
gees also hide in the area, hoping to escape notice. 
The unstable and damaged condition of the area 
creates an interesting tactical situation for the PCs 
and any creatures that rely on land movement. The 
rubble that is strewn everywhere hampers movement 
throughout the entire area; each square moved costs 
double. The rubble also prevents any land-based 
charges or running throughout the entire area. Final-
ly, any land-based attempts to Stealth are rolled with 
disadvantage due to the rock and grit underfoot.
Note: Major tremors in this Section have the 
potential to collapse parts of tunnels, sections of 
Rooms, block doors, etc., making it even more diffi-
cult to move through the area or even get out at all. If 
a door or passage is blocked by rocks, it requires 1d20 
minutes to clear the space for a Medium creature to 
squeeze through.
A57 . NEARLY EMPTY ROOM
The door to this Room has been wedged partial-
ly open by the earthquake and requires a DC 18 
Strength check to force it completely open.
Darker than most rooms, rubble and dust cover the 
floor. Squinting your eyes, you can see a small boot 
sticking from behind a stack of rocks.
Initial Attitude: Varies
Encounter: This Room appears empty, but if the PCs 
investigate they find the boot is on the foot of a hal-
fling near death. The halfing is hiding from nearby 
creatures and hoping for some kind of intervention.
The purpose of this encounter is two-fold. 
One, this is a chance for the PCs to meet an NPC 
who may or may not join the group. Two, if a PC 
has died, this halfling could be their replacement. 
Therefore, the name, class, and gender of the hal-
fling are left for the gamemaster to define.
If the halfling remains an NPC, he/she/they 
slipped into the dungeon by accident a few weeks 
ago and snuck around in the dark avoiding the 
dangers. The halfling doesn’t know where the major 
factions are in this area, but might be able to draw 
a crude map of earthquake hallways.
The halfling knows there are nearby monsters 
and speaks quietly. The halfling is also slathered 
in some kind of oil and musk that is reminiscent 
of skunk and lavender. It is strange, but not over-
whelming. It conceals his/her/their scent from the 
nearby rats.

71
Encounter Condition: Tremors 14
Tactics: Allow any creatures or random encounters 
(perhaps prep them after this) in Rooms A58, A60, 
A61, and A62 to roll Wisdom (Perception) checks at 
advantage opposed by a Stealth check by whoever 
opened the door to Room A57.
Should the PCs decide to kill the halfling, the 
combat is over in seconds, but the creatures in 
Room A58 definitely hear it without requiring a roll.
Note: If the PCs have already dealt with the 
other monsters, ignore the concerns about noise. 
though the halfling may be more ready for the 
group in such a case.
Treasure: The halfling carries a wineskin, two more 
days of rations, a perfume bottle with oily perfume, 
a torch, some rope, and a personal weapon. If the 
PCs have already made a level or two before arriving 
here, the weapon is magical.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
place a small hole in the wall between Rooms A57 
and A58. Something might come through when 
the PCs least expect it, or the creatures in Room 
A58 already hear the PCs coming. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, do not allow the nearby 
creatures an advantage of any Wisdom (Percep-
tion) checks.
A58 . FIENDISH MEPHITS 
The earthquake forced both doors off their hinges. 
They lay on a pile of rubble just inside the doorway. 
The western one is far worse than the eastern one, 
which acts as a semi-barrier to entry.
This rubble-strewn room appears to have an exit; 
you can make out the top half of a door in the 
wall across from this doorway. Darkness and dust 
shroud the contents as strange shadows dance on 
the walls.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This Room is filled with rubble. Parts of 
the ceiling have given way, collapsing inward, along 
with dirt and granite. There appears to be three 
fiendish darkmantles among the rocks near the 
center of the room. However, they are exceptionally 
difficult to distinguish from dust, dirt, and boulders 
(DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check).
Also hiding amongst the rocks is a fiendish dire 
rat. It waits to feed on whatever falls into its lap. It 
is not aggressive, but will defend itself.
Encounter Condition: Poor Footing 4
Tactics: The well-camouflaged fiendish darkmantles 
are, in fact, fiendish steam mephits wearing the 
hides of dead darkmantles. Most likely, the mephits 
gain surprise and can move and attack before the 
PCs. They roll initiative separately, acting as unique 
individuals. The mephits wait until a PC is within 10 
ft. to attack, throwing off the dead skin onto the PC, 
and then taking action.
The first mephit casts misty step (which lasts 
for 1 minute) and teleports to behind the PCs, the 
second mephit uses its steam attack, and the third 
mephit flies into melee range with an exposed PC, 
using its claw attack. Mix it up round after round, 
after this.
Treat the mephit’s use of the darkmantle skin as 
a ranged attack, at advantage. If a mephit hits, that 
character is blinded until an action is spent remov-
ing the skin. If the attack fails, the skin falls to the 
ground with no effect.
The fiendish dire rat only fights if it needs to, 
helping the mephits flank if the opportunity arises. 
The mephits tolerate the rat and vice versa, though 
they turn on one another if the need arises, most 
likely after the fight is over.
The rubbled floor creates uneven footing for the 
PCs meaning any Dexterity check or saving throw 
is made with disadvantage. This does not affect the 
fiendish steam mephits, nor the fiendish dire rat.
Misty step works up to 30 feet, so one of the 
fiendish steam mephits can teleport just out-
side the door or to the other side of the Room if 
necessary.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter 
add two fiendish dire rats and have them en-
gage the PCs aggressively. To decrease the chal-
lenge, remove the darkmantle skins from two of 
the mephits.
A59 . CLOSET 
The earthquake caused the lintel above the door 
to collapse. As a result, the door requires a DC 15 

 72
Strength check to open, which causes the lintel to 
collapse further, like a falling block trap.
 '
Falling Block Trap. +7 to hit one target (whoever 
opened the door). On a hit, the target suffers 3d6 
bludgeoning damage. DC 12 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check to find, DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check 
to disarm.
 Once the door is opened, read the following text. 
Peering through the narrow juncture, you can see a 
number of opened chests lined against one wall of 
this small room. 
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The Room contains four opened and 
emptied wooden chests of varying sizes and qual-
ities and one closed one. Some torn sacks lie on 
the floor as well. Some soiled blankets remain from 
when someone used this Room to rest. Metal shav-
ings and chipped stone lie inside one of the chests, 
where someone has sharpened a blade.
Inside the closed chest is a warlock’s familiar, a 
cat. During a fight, the cat hid in the chest and it 
snapped shut. He’s been in there for days, unable 
to get out. The warlock is presumed dead, but 
is actually alive in Room A99. The cat’s name is 
Gypsum, though it’s a cat so it won’t respond to the 
name anyway.
The PCs are welcome to take the cat with them, 
though the cat still behaves like a cat despite its 
high intelligence. Should the PCs attempt to com-
municate with the cat (using empathy, magic, skills, 
etc.), they must succeed on a DC14 Intelligence 
(Arcana) or a DC14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) 
check. If they offer the hungry Gypsum some food, 
this check is made at advantage. If they win Gyp-
sum over, the cat quickly comes to understand their 
objectives slightly better and tries to attach itself to 
a magic-user, preferably a wizard (or someone who 
can take on an animal companion).
Should the GM approve, a PC may always cast 
find familiar on the cat, adding it to his retinue. And 
should the party find the warlock (Nylinn) in Room 
A99, he will probably want his cat back.
Once the Room is cleaned up, this is a safe place 
for the PCs to rest, especially with only one way in. 
It is even possible to rig up a pulley, using a rope, 
to enable the fallen lintel to be raised and lowered 
from within quite easily–negating the need for a 
Strength check each time the PCs wish to enter. 
With a little thought, the PCs could turn this into 
an effective outpost for themselves.
Encounter Condition: Safe, Tremors 10
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: Amidst the debris on the ground are a few 
soiled blankets and shards of metal. PCs succeed-
ing at a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check find 
a torn bag filled with 16 gp and a chipped eye agate 
(55 gp). This eye agate belonged to the now-miss-
ing wizard.
All of the chests have long since been looted.
There is one of interest, however. On a DC14 
Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) 
check, a false bottom can be discovered in one of 
the chests. Beneath the false bottom is a portal 
connecting this chest to one of the other empty 
chests in Room A67. Any item of small size passed 
through this portal ends up in the chest in A67 and 
vice versa. This magical effect is permanent, and 
the distance between the two chests has no impact 
on how effective it is. Clever PCs can likely think of 
dozens of ways of making use of this connection. 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools) DCs of the falling block trap to 20 
and increase the damage to 3d6. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the Intelligence (Investigation) 
and Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) DCs to 12 each and 
reduce the damage to 1d6.
A60-A63 . SOLITARY CELLS 
These small cells are near-identical. The door to each 
is closed, but there is a locking bolt on the outside. 
The PCs may deduce that these were holding cells for 
something.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Due to their narrow construction, these 
former cells have managed to escape the damage 

73
suffered by the rest of this area. Each cell contains 
a series of crude graffiti depicting orcs triumphing 
over their foes, bullying troglodytes, and crushing 
kobold skulls beneath their feet. They contain little 
essential information, but if the characters take 
some time to study them, they gain advantage 
on their next Intelligence (History) or Intelligence 
(Investigation) check related to the orc presence in 
the region.  
The doors to these cells are fully functional.
There is a 3 in 20 chance of finding the rem-
nants of an extraplanar creature’s remains under 
the rubble.
Encounter Condition: Drafty or Stagnant Air, Safe
Tactics: N/A

A64 . SOLITARY CELL
The door to this Room is locked with a bolt on this 
side. Opening the door is easy enough, but the PCs 
may ask first, “What is locked inside?”
A rotting dead orc lies on top of a pile of rubble. 
The earth below is ruptured, and viney plants grow 
up around the rubble wherever it can reach. Some 
of the plant life has tangled around the rotting 
corpse, begging the question: how long has the orc 
been dead, and how fast do the vines grow?
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Captured and killed by the kobolds, this 
orc sorceress was thrown into this cell and locked 
inside after being strangled. To be sure she could 
not come back and harm them, the kobolds locked 
the cell from the outside.
The plants in this cell grow faster because of the 
magical nature of the orc. She continued to exude 
magical energy, even in death, drawing the plants 
closer to her. In time, the vines will eventually ani-
mate the orc, and she will return as a revenant with 
some druidic powers.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The shin bones of the orc have come loose 
from the flesh and cartilage. Since the orc was a 
sorcerer, the bone has some magical properties. 
But to what end? The GM is encouraged to allow 
the PCs to get creative with it if they clean it up and 
study the bone.
Scaling: N/A 
A65 . SOLITARY CELL
The door to this Room is open.
Pushing open the slightly open door, you see 
another cell filled with rocks and destruction. 
Rubble piles up, cracking the stonework. Exposed 
dirt beneath the floor shows signs of viny plants 
growing through the cracks. And with plant life 
comes insects.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly 
Encounter: As the PCs stay longer in the Room, more 
and more insects climb up the vines. This may not 
be noticeable at first, but eventually the floor will 
be filled with bugs. Every manner of bug. After 15 
minutes, enough bugs will appear to form a fiend-
ish insect swarm.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs stay too long, the swarm burrows 
its way into their boots and bites at their feet. If the 
PCs leave, the swarm eventually finds them an hour 
later. If the PCs defeat this one, another swarm 
shows up in one week’s time.
For some inexplicable reason, the swarm cannot 
see/sense elven characters, who become immune to 
the swarm’s attacks. This should not be evident for a 
few rounds of combat.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a second swarm, three rounds after this one 
appears. To decrease the challenge of this encoun-
ter, allow the PCs Wisdom checks to notice the 
swarm forming one round before it attacks.
A66 . PRISON 
All of the doors to this Room are open.
The floor is covered in rubble. Wood and linen 
lie crushed under hundreds of pounds of stone. 
Centipedes and other bugs feed on whatever they 
can find, turning on one another as well. A dead

dire rat lies on its side, bloated stomach exposed to 
the elements and being eaten from the inside out 
by insects.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Everything is buried under rubble that 
comes up to the average human’s waist. Although 
this Room reveals nothing of interest, it is the gate-
way to the vault at Room A67.
The PCs must clamber across the top of the 
rubble to reach any of the numerous doors in 
this Room. Doing so requires a successful DC14 
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
A failure results in 1d3 falling damage as the char-
acters tumble down, shredding hands, knees, and 
dignity. The PCs only need to make this check the 
first time they attempt the rubble.
The walls here are unstable and it is possible for 
the PCs to cause a wall to collapse inward. If they 
are clumsy or dash around the Room without a 
care, have the wall collapse on someone.
 '
Collapsing Wall Trap. Creatures in a 15-ft. cube must 
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 
bludgeoning damage. Creatures that succeed take 
half damage. DC 14 Investigation check to find, DC 
16 Strength check to disable.

A67 . PRISON VAULT 
The door to this Room is partially open. Rubble 
blocks the doorway except for a narrow 1-ft. wide 
opening. Inside, magical darkness eats up most of 
the light.
Though the door will not budge, you can see into 
the room from the doorway. The darkness of this 
room becomes evident. While you can see the edges 
of the room from your torchlight, the light only 
barely reaches. It is as though the darkness was 
swallowing the light.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was once a prison vault for items of 
minor importance. Magical darkness stops light 
from traveling too far or illuminating the details. 
Any check related to sight suffers disadvantage on 
the roll. Dispel magic will not negate this magical 
darkness, and a light spell is only a temporary fix.
A Small creature or smaller can crawl through 
the opening without a problem. A creature of Medi-
um size must succeed at a DC 19 Dexterity (Acro-
batics) check to pass through the existing opening. 
A Large creature or larger cannot pass through.
Attempts to widen the opening require caution. 
A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
reveals that the entire thing will collapse unless 
properly shored up and also how to go about doing 
so. If these skills are not available, then treat the 
threat of collapse as a falling block trap.
 '
Falling Block Trap. +7 to hit one target (whoever 
opened the door). On a hit, the target suffers 3d6 
bludgeoning damage. DC 12 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion check to find, DC 16 Strength (athletics) check 
to disarm.
 Widening the opening properly requires 1d6 
hours. Attempts to widen the opening without the 
benefit of a successful check results in the entire 
thing collapsing and burying the entire doorway 
under rubble, causing the damage stated in the 
trap description above. Ironically, doing so creates 
an opening large enough for a Medium creature 
to crawl through near the top of the doorway. The 
vault itself is in good shape, having been well de-
signed. There are a total of 5 chests in the vault, all 
of them open.
Encounter Condition: Tremor 18
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: One of these chests is the sister Telepor-
tation Chest to the first one, found in Room A59. 
Determining which requires a DC14 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check. Beyond this, all of the chests 
are empty except for one that holds a small black 
silk bundle about 1 ft. long. This bundle contains 
five metal batons with a continual flame spell placed 
on the tip. Although not designed as a weapon, they 
can be used as such in an emergency (treat them 
as clubs).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the attack bonus of the falling block trap to 

75
+9 and the damage to 5d6. To decrease the chal-
lenge, reduce the damage to 2d6.
A68 . COLLAPSED GUARD POST 
The door to this Room is partially open. Rubble 
blocks the door, and a DC 14 Strength check is re-
quired to push it open. The PCs can smell smoke and 
burned flesh coming from inside.
The smell of smoke and charred flesh fills the air. It 
is not suffocating, but smells awful. Although there 
has been a partial collapse of the ceiling, which has 
crushed much of the furniture that was once here, 
there are still three chairs in one piece. Two bodies 
lie burned to a crisp along one wall.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was a guard post a while ago, 
but the furniture was left behind when the ko-
bolds retreated south. The chairs are unremarkable 
and made for creatures with shorter build. There 
is a weapons rack behind the door, holding four 
rusty spears.
A pair of kobold bodies lie burned, having died 
from disease — most likely the mold from one of 
the earlier Rooms. The kobolds set fire to the bodies 
to kill any infection.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The spears, despite being dusty, are 
fit for use. 
Scaling: N/A
A69 . RESERVE BARRACKS 
The door to this Room is open. 
Large portions of the floor of this room are strewn 
with rubble. The numerous cracks in the walls do 
not suggest much safety. Rows of dark wooden 
bunk beds, most of them damaged by the rubble, 
give some clue as to what this area was used for.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: As a former reserve barracks, this area was 
emptied of anything of interest when the previous 
occupants left. The bunk beds are clearly designed 
for humanoids. 
Currently Boyikt, the kobold wizard (and broth-
er of the dead kobold leader Borryn), four kobold 
warriors (hp 14, 9, 8, 8), and a krenshar occupy the 
Room. Having escaped the orc assault and the 
subsequent attacks by the extraplanar beasts, the 
kobolds have sought refuge. They have regrouped 
and sometimes send scouts out for a way out of 
the dungeon. Presently, four kobold foot soldiers 
have taken the route south and then east in search 
for an exit. 
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Cover
Tactics: The kobolds always have one of their number 
along with the krenshar stationed near the door 
keeping an eye, ear, and nose out on things. PCs 
using light sources are quickly spotted, and even 
those moving silently and in darkness cannot es-
cape the krenshar’s scent ability. The remaining ko-
bolds have built an impromptu fort by piling stones 
in the southeast corner of the Room, sectioning off 
a 10-ft.-by-10-ft. region. This provides three-quar-
ters cover and advantage on Dexterity saving throws 
and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. 
Once the krenshar and/or kobold guard spot 
an enemy, the two retreat back to a small blind 
near the fort gaining half-cover. The kobolds hope 
that danger passes them by and remain silent. 
If this does not work, they ambush their enemy 
with surprise.
While waiting to see what develops, Boyikt 
prepares magic missile as a held action while the 

 76
remaining kobolds prepare their slings as held 
actions. The kobolds attack with their slings the 
moment the first PC steps through the door while 
Boyikt casts his magic missile. The krenshar holds its 
scare ability in readiness should the PC attempt to 
advance into the Room.
Once the opening shots have been fired, the 
combat can go any number of ways. If the PCs wish 
to shoot it out with distance weapons and spells, 
they can take advantage of the cover offered by the 
doorway, the rubble, and the beds. In general, this 
provides half cover. If they choose to charge at the 
fort they find the going across the rubble-strewn 
floor slowed (the rubble is considered rough ter-
rain) while being subjected to Boyikt’s area effect 
spells. The kobolds continue to fire their slings 
while the krenshar makes use of its scare ability; the 
physically smaller kobolds avoid physical combat 
whenever possible, only using their spears when 
the krenshar resorts to its natural weapons.
Boyikt holds his spells in reserve for critical mo-
ments. He picks off weakened PCs with ray of frost 
and acid splash, but holds his area of effect spells 
such as color spray and sleep until he can get maxi-
mum effect out of them. One particular combina-
tion is to cast mirror image when the PCs get too 
close, and then vampiric touch to keep the enemy 
guessing which image cast the spell. He might also 
cast animate dead on a fallen krenshar.
The well-prepared kobolds are a strong chal-
lenge to the PCs and if combat can be avoided it 
should be. The kobolds are paranoid, afraid of ev-
erything that moves and for this reason they attack 
any non-kobolds that come into the area. However, 
that does not mean they are unwilling to negoti-
ate. After all, their situation at present is less than 
comfortable given not only the monsters roaming 
the dungeon but also the instability of this area. If 
the PCs choose to negotiate, either before combat 
starts or even after, Boyikt listens.
Boyikt’s attitude is indifferent for the purpose of 
resolving any Charisma (Persuasion) checks con-
cerning a cooperative arrangement once hostilities 
cease. If Turag (Room A28) is with the PCs, impose 
disadvantage on the Persuasion check. Although 
the exchange should be role-played rather than 
relying on dice. If the PCs manage to establish 
rapport with Boyikt then he demands an exchange 
of information.
Boyikt can relate his experiences concerning the 
battles with the orcs and the coming of the ex-
traplanar beasts. More importantly, Boyikt believes 
the beasts are coming from the northeastern Re-
gion of the dungeon, and he suspects that Longtail 
is behind the appearance of the creatures, although 
how precisely that came about is a mystery. He can 
tell the PCs about the secret door to Room A108. 
The kobolds discovered it while they were securing 
their area but were unable to open it (let the PCs 
come to the conclusion that it is a one-way door on 
their own as Boyikt only knows they could not get 
the door open).
Although he is free with information, Boyikt has 
no intention of joining the PCs to face Longtail. He 
has a healthy dose of respect for the wererat sorcer-
er and has no intention of going to the place where 
he suspects all those beasts came from. If the PCs 
say that they are looking for a way out, Boyikt and 
the kobolds may become convenient allies of the 
PCs, but only if Turag is not with the party (Boyikt 
cannot be persuaded to change his mind on that 
point and, in fact, wants the orc dead before mak-
ing any deals).
If the kobolds do accompany the PCs, they insist 
on being treated as equals. Of course, Boyikt is 
smart enough to realize that if the PCs are really 
heading for a showdown with the wererat (heading 
east is a strong clue), then he and the kobolds part 
ways with the PCs. 
In combat, the kobolds’ preferred tactics are to 
engage from a distance and gang up on opponents 
whenever possible; fighting alongside the PCs, they 
prefer to let the PCs do the close-quarters fighting 
while they pepper the opponents with sling stones, 
rushing in to attack and finish off weakened foes.
Being trained in teamwork, the kobolds work 
closely with the PCs and coordinate their attacks 
with them. They help out the PCs to the best of 
their ability, although always with an eye to their 
own safety, and expect the same from the PCs. 
Boyikt is a decent tactician and is especially adept at 
using his spells to the best effect. However, he will 
always try to hold a spell or two in reserve (usually 
sleep and mirror image) just in case the alliance with 
the PCs goes sour. In a worst-case scenario, he uses 
his scroll of tiny hut to escape the PCs for as long 
as possible.

77
Whenever the kobolds are on the move, one 
kobold warrior and the krenshar take the lead 
acting as scouts and they suggest the same if they 
are traveling with the PCs. Once the scouts have 
spotted something, they sneak back to the remain-
ing kobolds and report the situation. The kobolds 
prefer to avoid combat when possible and sneak by 
opponents rather than face them. PCs that insist 
on fighting everything they see find the kobolds 
leaving them.
If facing combat, the kobolds set up an ambush 
in the most favorable location — one that restricts 
the movement possibilities of their foes while 
allowing the kobolds to concentrate their missile 
fire and using the krenshar’s scare ability to prevent 
any enemy rushes at their positions. Because of 
the krenshar’s good movement rate, they use the 
creature as bait to lure extraplanar beasts into a 
prepared ambush whenever possible.
Treasure: The kobolds have nothing to spare. Not 
even food. They might have some orc weapons they 
were able to scrounge, but even healing potions 
have been used to keep them alive. If the PCs kill 
all of the kobolds, they find Boyikt’s spell book and 
scroll, along with some of the trapmaking parts the 
kobold warriors have scrapped together. If the PCs 
are especially kind to any of the warriors, he shares 
a trinket with one of the PCs — a pebble that stays 
warm all the time. He personally uses it when he 
makes soup. Another kobold may share some of his 
edible mushrooms that he keeps in a warm sack.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the kobolds place trip wires across the floor, 
requiring a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to cross 
the Room without tripping and falling prone. To de-
crease the challenge of this encounter, have Boyikt 
ready sleep instead and make parlay a more obvious 
approach to the encounter.
A70-A77 . THE RUBBLE
While still a subset of a larger Section, these eight 
Rooms are daily uninhabited and ravaged by the 
earthquake. Only a few of these Room possess any-
thing of value as well. Random encounters are rare 
here, and most of the area has already been picked 
through. As such, the descriptions are fairly repetitive. 
GMs are encouraged to mix up the contents of the 
Rooms by dropping non-fiendish vermin here and 
there. None of these Rooms are safe to rest in.
A70 . LIVING QUARTERS 
The door to this Room is open.
 Rubble covers the floor and spills out into the hall-
way. A partially collapsed archway across from the 
door appears to give access to the room beyond.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The earthquake damaged this Room rath-
er heavily, and the rubble is piled at least knee-high 
everywhere. The archway to Room A71 has partially 
collapsed, although there is still enough space for a 
medium creature to duck through.
A tall but crude voodoo doll effigy has been left 
behind. It is made of leftover wood, bones, and orc 
hair, shaped into something awkward. Nails have 
been driven into the face and stomach of the doll, 
while burn marks cover its hands and feet.

A71 . QUARTERS 
This room is slightly less damaged than the pre-
vious one, and you can still see portions of what 
must have been a bed peeking out from under the 
rubble piles.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This is another abandoned living area. 
The bed, although identifiable, is completely ruined. 
The remnants of a kobold war party ritual remain. 
There are bowls of coagulated blood, some candles, 
tied sticks, and colored chalk dust all around the 
ground. A severed orc hand stands out among the 
mundane items.

Treasure: If the PCs spent 15 minutes searching the 
Room, they eventually discovered a clay jar with six 
orc eyes inside. All of the eyes are discolored. The 
eyes have started to rot.

A72 . FOUNTAIN ROOM 
The eastern door from the hallway is open. The west-
ern door leading to Room A21 is closed and trapped 
(see Room A21 for trap description).
Chunks of rock of varying sizes create an almost 
mountainous terrain in this large and long room. In 
the center, a crushed fountain rests. Whatever was 
in the fountain is long gone.
 Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Rubble fills the Room in numerous piles. 
Medium-sized creatures and smaller can pick their 
way through but must use a full action to move 5 
feet in any direction, including diagonally. Note that 
this is not a “5-ft.” step and thus provokes attacks of 
opportunity.
The basin/fountain that sat in the Room was 
crushed during the earthquake. The water was 
clean, and divine fish swam inside. Both are gone 
now. Even the meditation mats that circled the 
fountain are gone to the ravages of time.
There is still a faint holy energy about the place, 
however. This is a good place for a cleric to pray but 
not a safe place to rest.

A73 . MAKESHIFT BARRACKS
Both doors to this Room are open. However, while 
the door from the hallway is perfectly normal, the 
doorway leading to Room A74 is trapped with a 
resetting color spray trap (see Room A74). 
The top of a slightly dented but intact censer peeks 
out from the rubble in this otherwise empty room.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This large Room was yet another of a 
series of makeshift barracks for the orcs, but the 
rubble made living conditions difficult. They moved 
on to the east but fought off more fiendish crea-
tures along the way.
A censer was left behind by its previous occupants as 
it was too big to carry. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The censer is about 4 ft. high and weighs 
180 lbs. It is made of wrought iron with an uncov-
ered bowl at its top. Bas relief designs cover the 
censer, revealing a very pricey item. The whole item 
would fetch a handsome price (250 gp) from a col-
lector if the PCs could carry it out of here.
Scaling: N/A
A74 . SLEEPING CHAMBER 
The secret door between A74 and A75 is readily iden-
tifiable by a line of over a dozen iron spikes that have 
been driven into the space between the door and the 
door sill. The wedged spikes increase the Strength 
check required to open this door to 27, making it 
all but impossible to do so, especially from Room 
A75. Each spike is wedged in tight and requires a DC 
23 Strength check to remove, although having the 
proper tools (such as a sledgehammer and a pry bar) 
grants advantage to the check.
The southern door leading to this Room is trapped 
and activates the moment any creature touches the 
door. A DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a 
round nozzle above the door, which might alert the 
PCs that this is a trap. The color spray covers the 
doorway as well as a cone-shaped area 15 ft. into 
Room A73. 
 '
Color Spray Trap. Creatures in a 15-ft. cone must 
succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be 
blinded for 1 minute. DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to find, DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
to disarm.
This room is covered with dust and rubble. You can 
make out stained and faded images on the walls. 
Mold and decay climb the walls from wet spots in 
the walls’ deepest creases. You hold back a cough as 
your torchlight dances off the walls.

may notice (DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check) a 
glint in the rubble. Digging, they can discover a 
crushed gold and lead goblet amid splinters of fur-
niture. The goblet is worth roughly 20 gp if melted 
down. Inside a false bottom of the goblet lies a 
small, thin, rusted key.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
allow a Random Encounter after the trap triggers. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the DC to notice 
the trap by 2.
A75 . ASSISTANT QUARTERS 
The secret door between A74 and A75 is readily iden-
tifiable by a line of over a dozen iron spikes that have 
been driven into the space between the door and the 
door sill. The wedged spikes increase the Strength 
check required to open this door to 27, making it all 
but impossible to do so, especially from Room A75. 
Each spike is wedged in tight and requires a DC 
23 Strength check to remove, although having the 
proper tools (such as a sledgehammer and a pry bar) 
grants advantage to the check.
The north and south doors to this Room are open. 
The damage seems minimal in comparison to the 
other rooms in the area. There is, however, loose 
rubble on the floor. A number of skeletal, rust-red 
rodents scurry from your light.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Sniffing their way through the rubble 
are several dozen weak fiendish rats. They are part 
of a fiendish rat swarm, but not enough to be a 
major threat. Yet. They are what remains of the rats 
in Room A76.
Encounter Condition: Fog 10
Tactics: The fiendish rat swarm is spread out over 
both Rooms as individual members search for their 
own hiding places in the rubble. The moment the 
PCs’ presence is detected, the fiendish rats in Room 
A75 run to Room A76. Three rounds later, a fiendish 
rat swarm flows from Room A76 and attacks.
This process starts the moment the PCs are de-
tected, either through a light source or through the 
rodents’ scent ability (30 ft. to detect presence, 5 ft. 
to pinpoint location). Once the fiendish rat swarm 
is formed, it pursues the PCs mercilessly, fighting 
until it is destroyed.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add three fiendish dire rats. To decrease the chal-
lenge of this encounter, have the fiendish rat swarm 
be only at half strength (half hit points and cover-
ing only a 5 ft. by 10 ft. area; all other stats remain 
the same).
A76 . ASSISTANT QUARTERS 
There is a secret door between Rooms A76 and A77. 
A DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the door, 
but a DC 20 Strength check is required to open it. 
The earthquake has made the door easy to spot but 
wedged it against the wall. 
The northern door to this Room is open. 
This room is slightly damaged. Only a smattering 
of rubble dots the floor of this massive room. Two 
relatively intact beds and a small table remain.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Sniffing their way through the rubble are 
several scores of weak fiendish rats. They are part of 
a fiendish rat swarm, but not enough to be a major 
threat. The rest of the swarm is in Room A75.
The beds, really just pallets with legs, are rub-
ble-covered, and one is cracked. The small table 
is intact. Inside the desk is a letter, written in an 
ancient form of elvish, which the PCs may or may 
not be able to decipher. It details the contents of 
the cells (Rooms A60 through A65), though the 
contents of those Rooms are long gone.
Encounter Condition: N/A

A77 . EXPERIMENT ROOM 
There is a secret door between Rooms A76 and A77. A 
DC 14 Perception check reveals the door, but a DC 20 
Strength check is required to open it. The earthquake 
made the door easy to spot but wedged it against 
the wall. 
The northern door to this Room is open.
This large room shows some signs of deteriora-
tion but looks to be relatively intact. Skeletons of 
various sizes hang limply from a number of mana-
cles that are attached to the wall in various places. 
More skeletons lie on the floor, their legs shackled 
via a chain to a large iron spike that has been driv-
en into the center of the floor. A small lockbox lies 
against the southeast corner. It has been smashed 
open and some of the wood is rotted.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was once used to study the 
effects of magic on anything and everything. The 
unfortunate would be shackled to the walls or 
shackled to the spike in the center of the floor, and 
various spells would course through the victim’s 
body. PCs that examine the walls or floor see a 
number of scorch marks as well as places where the 
floor is cracked or melted. 
Any intelligent creature that touches any of the 
manacles, chains, or the spike in the center of the 
floor must succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom save or fall 
prey to the emotional remnants that still haunt 
this Room. Those who save see fleeting images of 
torture in their minds for one round, but otherwise, 
nothing happens. Those who fail the saving throw 
are paralyzed for 2d4 rounds as the anguish of 
those who died in this Room floods through them. 
The entire experience is so powerful that it leaves 
the creatures shaken (disadvantage on attack rolls 
and ability checks) for 1 hour afterward. Animals 
and beasts can sense the emotions in this Room 
and do not willingly enter it. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The lockbox is unusually heavy and radi-
ates transmutation magic. Anyone examining the 
box sees remnants of an old book, now covered in 
mold. Instinct tells the PCs the book is over 200 
years old. The book is written in common, though 
by a simpleton. It is filled with records of the exper-
iments that were conducted here. GMs are welcome 
to detail just how grotesque the experiments were 
and what those effects would be on the reader.

A78-A99 . THE WIDENING GYRE
The convoluted hallways and strange locations of 
Rooms A78 through A99 show the celestial’s dedi-
cation to traps within traps within traps. Building 
corridors where they were not needed, erecting secret 
doors to areas of no relevance, and planting traps to 
fill the emptiness, they befuddled and confused the 
prisoners of this dungeon for centuries. 
The lack of logic and straightforward access made 
this Section a prime location for the treasure-hunting 
activities of the humanoids, who braved its twisting 
corridors and hungry traps in search of the gold 
promised to them by Longtail. After all, who would 
build something as convoluted and trap-ridden as 
this without having something to hide?
It was in this area that the tenuous alliance be-
tween the orcs and reptilians faltered as search teams 
stumbled upon other search teams, and neither side 
could truly tell who had the rights to which Rooms. 
The situation was not helped by the fact that entire 
search teams from both sides were wiped out by 
traps, naturally leading each side to believe that the 
other had killed them.
Currently, the area is home to large numbers of 
extraplanar beasts who are competing for the right to 
establish nests in the area. As Orghar and a few orc 
survivors huddle in a small Room, the orc war lead-
er’s mind slowly disconnects from reality. Finally, the 
lizardfolk guides have found temporary shelter (Room 
A96) in their search for an escape.
A78 . ANTECHAMBER 
The door to this Room is open.

81
Rotting barrels, crates, sacks, and some archaic 
tools fill the space. There seems to be no rhyme or 
reason for how things are stored. It’s as though 
a child stocked the room. A mixture of moisture 
and dust fill the room inexplicably. Bare footprints 
trace around the room in a meandering pattern. A 
hallway in the center of the opposite wall shows 
the way out.
The hallway leading to Room A79 is trapped (see 
Room A79).
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: There are dozens of small barrels (vine-
gar), crates, and sacks in unorganized piles. Most 
of them have been torn open (the barrels have their 
tops staved in, the crate boards torn away, and the 
sacks have been ripped open, some of their con-
tents spilling onto the ground). The humanoids ex-
plored this area and then reorganized it as though 
they were moving in.
Along the eastern wall is a rack filled with archaic 
tools too large for human hands. They defy logic. 
Some look like pliers, and others like drills, but not 
anything humans would conceive of.
If the PCs rifle through the contents, they find 
that the barrels contain vinegar (still good), the 
crates contain various discarded and rotted cloth-
ing, and the contents of the sacks are now lost to 
the mold.

A79 . TRAPPED PRISON CHAMBER 
There are two mouths to the hall between Rooms A78 
and A79 — north and south. The hallway is trapped at 
both ends with scorching ray traps. These traps trig-
ger the moment a creature enters the hallway from 
Room A78 and again as they exit into Room A79.
Piles of dust and burnt bones hint at something 
unusual. A dead giant rat stands at the first mouth 
opening. Down the hallway, a pile of clothes grabs 
your attention.
If either Turag or Boyikt are with the PCs, they can 
warn them about the traps. Whether they choose to 
do so is up to them. Regardless, they will not enter 
the hallway between the Rooms.
 '
Scorching Ray Trap. Three rays of flame attack up to 
three targets within 10 ft. +6 to hit, 2d6 damage per 
ray. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) to notice, DC 20 
Intelligence (Arcana) to disarm. Automatically resets 
after 1 round.
Once the PCs have moved past both traps, read 
the following text.
A series of iron bollards jut up from the stonework 
floor in a haphazard pattern. Some bollards have 
been shackled. Others have sigils and glyphs etched 
into them. One radiates a faint green glow. The 
room feels evil and unnerving...
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: Numerous demonic creatures were once 
shackled here. Over the years, they have escaped 
into the nearby Regions or been destroyed by 
particularly fearsome wardens. The bollards once 
contained powerful magic to keep the demons in 
check, but that has faded. Evil energy persists where 
abjuration magic once stood.
PCs with empathic powers may be able to read 
what has happened here. Don’t ask for a roll; just 
provide the characters with feelings, intuition, and 
visions of the past. 
Encounter Condition: Smoke
Tactics: Once inside, this Room is a chilling but safe 
place for a short rest. No random encounters hap-
pen here. The denizens know better than to tempt 
the traps.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have each trap fire 4 rays each time they trigger (the 
rays can fire at different targets). To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, replace the scorching 
ray traps with burning hands traps, which deal only 
2d4 points of damage.
A80 . FIENDISH STIRGE NEST 
Note: This is a very difficult encounter, even for a 
3rd-level party. PCs are encouraged to back down if 

 82
their numbers dwindle. Gamemasters are encour-
aged to keep some stirges in reserve if too many PCs 
start to die.
Four extinguished and broken furnaces, one in each 
corner of the room, look out onto a floor littered 
with splintered wood. A large number of the flying 
bloodsuckers are hopping about the room. In the 
center of the room, a pale green aura fills an area 
about 18 inches across.
Even before the PCs arrive at the doorway, they 
hear the flapping and calling of the fiendish stirge 
swarm in this Room. The door to this Room is open 
and secured with a large iron spike that has been 
driven into the ground to prevent the door from be-
ing closed. A DC 18 Strength check is required to pull 
out the spike.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This area was once a workshop, destroyed 
years ago by escaped prisoners on a rampage. 
Currently, a large swarm of fiendish stirges has 
gathered here to make its home among the broken 
benches and empty furnaces. They sensed the evil 
here to be welcoming.
Encounter Condition: Safe (once the stirges are gone)
Tactics: There are a total of 20 fiendish stirges in this 
Room, making all manner of noise as they hop 
about, fighting each other for the ideal nesting 
place amidst the rubble. Due to the cacophony, the 
fiendish stirges have little chance of succeeding at 
a Perception check (they have disadvantage on the 
check) to hear or spot the PCs. However, any light 
source grabs their attention.
The fiendish stirges here are hyper-aggressive 
as they fight for dominance amongst themselves. 
Although they may notice the PCs, the fiendish 
stirges are not interested in pursuing them outside 
of the Room, so unless the PCs enter the Room, the 
fiendish stirges leave them alone. However, if the 
PCs enter the Room, the fiendish stirges attack. The 
easiest way to handle this is for the GM to divide 
the Room into quarters and assume that five or 
six fiendish stirges respond to the PCs whenever 
they enter one of the quarters while the remainder 
squabble amongst themselves. 
The same method is also used for area effect 
spells cast by the PCs or their allies. Whether the 
spell does harm or not, an area effect spell gets a 
response from the fiendish stirges that are in the 
area. If a spell covers only one quadrant, then only 
the five or six fiendish stirges within that quadrant 
respond. If it covers two quadrants, the 10 to 12 
fiendish stirges in those quadrants respond. How-
ever, unless the spell covers the entire Room, even 
if cast in the center no more than 10 to 12 fiendish 
stirges should respond. 
If the PCs remove the spike from the stone and 
close the door, the fiendish stirges are effectively 
trapped in the Room. Simply exiting the Room 
ends the encounter, and the stirges will even-
tually die.
No matter how many fiendish stirges attack, 
they seek out their own individual targets, prefer-
ring not to share their meal with anyone; the GM 
should spread the fiendish stirges out among all 
the available targets as evenly as possible, doubling 
up only when necessary. Because they are defend-
ing their territory, these fiendish stirges fight to the 
death, pursuing fleeing PCs out of the Room but 
not out into the hallway. 
Treasure: Resting on the floor, in the center of the 
Room, is a gold ring. It glows pale green and hums 
softly (if the PCs get near it). It is a ring of warmth, 
corrupted by the magic of the dungeon. It radiates 
a small degree of warmth at all times (whether or 
not it’s worn), and its presence here makes this 
Room hospitable. However, should a PC touch the 
ring, every stirge in the Room senses the distur-
bance and attacks.
The ring has no negative side effects other than 
the glow, which cannot be controlled, and casts a 
permanent light spell with a 1-foot radius.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
divide the Room in half instead of quarters (mean-
ing 10 fiendish stirges respond to an invasion of 
territory or a spell cast into each half ). To decrease 
the challenge of this encounter, the fiendish stirges 
are not hungry. They can only drain 5 hit points 
each, instead of the usual 10.
A81 . ORC GUARDS 
The door to this Room is presently open. Two orcs 
are on continuous duty in the doorway of this Room 
keeping an eye out on the hallway to the north and 
the secret door to the west. Both the secret door and 

83
the hallway door directly to the north of the doorway 
to A81 are closed.
The orc pair more than likely spot any approaching 
PCs, and close the door in response. The two hold the 
door closed as best as they can.
Read the following description when the PCs 
near the door.
A sturdy door stands before you. If you’re not 
mistaken, you just saw it move. Listening carefully, 
you think you hear voices inside.
The door does not lock, so an opposed Strength 
check is required to push the door open against the 
two orcs holding it closed. If the PCs get inside, read 
the following.
Nearly a dozen orcs stand, lean, and sit around 
the room that disappears into the darkness beyond 
your torchlight. Some are clearly wounded, others 
stand at the ready to fight off your entrance. On 
the floor is a large summoning circle of some 
kind, drawn in salt or something similar. Candles 
surround it, but they are not lit.
If the PCs have seen the table in Room A20, this 
drawing looks familiar to them. The drawing on top 
of the table is a crude version of this one, redrawn 
from memory. Orghar saw it in Longtail’s books, and 
he, in turn, tried to recreate it here, thinking it would 
help them all escape.
Initial Attitude: Hostile; Varies
Encounter: Orghar personally led the attack on Room 
A49 intent on establishing orc control. Meeting with 
surprisingly stiff kobold resistance, the orcs never 
noticed the emergence of the extraplanar beasts 
from Room A103 until it was too late. Forced to re-
treat, Orghar and his warriors fought their way back 
to Rooms A81 and A82, incurring horrific losses 
along the way. The door was battered by darkman-
tles and other creatures, rendering the lock useless.
There are a total of eight orcs (hp 18, 14, 13, 13, 
12, 12, 11, 10) in this Room, plus a berserker (hp 32), 
who is second in command to Orghar (Room A82). 
They are all that remains of Orghar’s clan, most of 
them still injured from the fighting. The health-
iest take turns standing guard, while waiting for 
Orghar’s leadership.
The orcs just want him to lead them from this 
forsaken place. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Two orcs stand guard near the doorway at 
all times. One keeps an eye out on the secret door 
to the west, the other one on the northern hallway 
door. Utterly spooked by the carnage that they 
witnessed, the moment either of those doors open, 
the orcs raise the alarm, close the door, and hold it 
from the inside. The berserker stands behind them 
but does not help hold the door.
The orcs know someone is coming and cannot 
be surprised, but it is unlikely the PCs are surprised 
either. There is a moment of shock when the orcs 
realize they are not fiendish creatures or kobolds. 
After the PCs push their way into the Room, 
both guards (the healthiest ones) and the berserker 
occupy the area around the doorway. The berserker 
meets the largest PC at the doorway.
The other orcs, wounded, take a round to get 
to their feet and ready their weapons. One orc 
runs to Room A82 to alert Orghar. The rest fight 
to the death — having nowhere left to go — but 
do not pursue fleeing PCs. If there is time and/
or the PCs take too long getting to the door and 
into the Room, the berserker quaffs his potion of 
bull’s strength.
Since the orcs hold their position within the 
Room, there is no immediate conflict unless the 
PCs attack. As such, the PCs can attempt to parley 
at any time. If they do not start a parley, a standoff 
begins. Eventually, the orcs will get gruff with the 
PCs and demand that they leave. Or worse.
If Turag is with the PCs, there will be questions 
(on both sides), but he encourages everyone to 
make peace. He hopes to rejoin his brethren and, if 
necessary, betray the PCs.
After enough time passes, Orghar arrives and 
demands someone speak. Though the orc attitude 
is initially hostile, the orcs are actually indifferent 
toward the PCs. Who are they anyway? Why are they 
here? This attitude remains even if Boyikt and his 
kobolds and/or Turag are with them.
Orghar’s goal for his group is survival, most 
likely by leaving the dungeon as quickly as pos-
sible. The PC’s presence indicates some hope in 
this regard. Regarding his own life, he does not 
care anymore.
If the PCs suggest an alliance, Orghar sudden-
ly comes to life. Seeing this as a challenge to his 

 84
power, the clan head dismisses talk of an alliance. 
Instead, he orders an attack on the PCs. How this 
situation evolves depends on how the PCs have 
acted and how the orcs perceive them.
If the PCs are obviously injured or in some way 
act inexperienced or unsure, the orcs do as Orghar 
commands, and a full-scale battle to the death be-
gins. If the PCs have the orcs’ respect, the warriors 
stand there unsure of themselves.
This vacillation angers Orghar. Calling up his 
rage, he attacks the PCs. Some of the orcs join 
the fight; others do not. Orghar has no intention 
of losing the leadership of the clan and fights to 
the death.
If the PCs kill Orghar, the remaining orcs 
propose an alliance with the PCs. The strongest of 
the remaining orcs suggests they work together to 
escape the dungeon.
While the orcs will work with the PCs and even 
battle alongside them, they do so with plans of 
eventually betraying their allies. As long as they 
fight the beasts, the orcs are highly motivated to 
do their part, but when facing anything else, they 
mind their own safety and let the PCs carry the 
brunt of the fighting.
If Boyikt is with the PCs, he encourages the PCs 
to attack along with his troops and finish the orcs 
off. If the PCs refuse, he baits the orcs, perhaps 
even casting a spell into the doorway, in an effort 
to start a fight. However, he does not engage the 
orcs while they have the tactical advantage. PCs 
can attempt to defuse the situation as they see fit, 
but the kobold wizard has a hostile attitude to-
wards any suggestions of an alliance with the orcs. 
Feel free to assign positive modifiers to attempts 
at Charisma (Diplomacy) checks with the kobold 
wizard if the PCs have saved the life of Boyikt 
or his kobolds. There is no way to convince the 
kobold wizard to ally with the orcs; either the PCs 
give up this idea of an alliance with the orcs, or the 
kobolds leave. If the PCs are foolish enough to try 
to stop the kobolds, the kobolds fight.
If Orghar arrives and there is a fight already in 
progress, he joins the combat with gusto, gaining 
an advantage on all rolls during the first round 
(the ring he wears drives him to kill, even in his 
defeated mental state). However, his malaise takes 
over two rounds later, in which he suffers one 
disadvantage on his first roll and one disadvantage 
on another roll the following round. Unless he sees 
some hope in the fight, Orghar eventually lowers 
his ax, gives up, and lets the PCs win, whatever that 
looks like in your game.
If Orghar dies while the others fight, the healthi-
est orc screams out with a battle cry, declaring him-
self the new clan leader. The rest accept until the 

85
battle is over and then fight amongst themselves 
for leadership.
This is most likely a bloodbath.
Treasure: Collectively, the orcs carry maybe 15 gp in 
various denominations, some trinkets, and their 
weapons. They have no magic, and only the ber-
serker possesses a potion, which he most likely has 
already drunk.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add four fully healed orcs or two berserkers. To de-
crease the challenge of this encounter, the orcs (not 
the berserker) are shaken.
A82 . ORGHAR'S SOLITUDE 
The door to this Room is open. Whether the PCs 
negotiate or fight their way past the orcs in Room A81 
to get to this point, the text is the same. 
A smaller room lies mostly barren, with floor mats, 
blankets, and some general adventuring gear 
strewn about the floor. Dirty candles have been 
knocked over and snuffed out.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This is Orghar’s private chamber. He is 
head of the clan of orcs that followed Longtail to 
the dungeon. Having watched virtually all his clans-
men die at the hands of the extraplanar beasts has 
caused his mind to drift.
Orghar is tall and powerful. Even for an orc, 
he stands half-a-foot taller than most. His face is 
a maze of scars, showing his experience in battle. 
Perhaps his prowess could be questioned, but his 
survival rate cannot. His left eye is missing, re-
placed with a glass eye that doesn’t match. It gives 
him a slight advantage when attempting to intim-
idate someone. There are tattoos all over his arms 
and neck, one for each battle he has won.
No longer interested in anything, he spends 
his time in this Room, lost in private reverie. He is 
morose and expects to die at any moment. His clan 
thinks he is dreaming up a plan for escape, but he 
has truly given up.
Orghar’s reputation within the clan is so great 
none of his clansmen attempted to replace him, 
even though he has led his clan to its demise and 
is exhibiting signs of mental illness. They have that 
much respect for him.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: One way or the other, Orghar has made it to 
Room A81 before the PCs find this Room.
Treasure: Orghar’s ring is a plain, unadorned circlet. 
It fits any finger perfectly. 
Orghar’s Ring: (Ring, Very Rare, Doesn’t Require 
Attunement)
While wearing the ring, your alignment changes to 
the next in sequence (so Lawful Good would be-
come Lawful Neutral; Neutral Good would become 
Neutral; and so on). You gain advantage when mak-
ing a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimi-
date) check against and with an evil creature. 
Scaling: N/A 
A83 . HOLY ILLUSORY FIRE 
The smell of burnt flesh and leather hangs heavy 
in the air.
This smell is part of the illusion. The door to this 
Room is closed and trapped; a fiery elemental-type 
creature is painted on the door. Describe it however 
you like to the PCs, as they’ve probably never seen 
one before. A fire spell triggers the moment a Tiny or 
larger creature touches the door. A large glyph signals 
the presence of the trap, however.
 '
Fire Trap: Fire erupts in a 10 ft. radius. Creatures in 
the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw or take 3d6 (illusory) fire damage or half on a 
successful save. DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check 
to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. 
DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) to disbelieve.

 86
Once the door is open, read the following.
The lighting inside the room is strange. There is a 
gray-blue glow coming from somewhere, but it is 
unclear where the source is. The ceiling, floor, and 
walls of the Room are covered in a thick layer of 
burnt slime. Embedded in the far wall is the imprint 
of an angelic shape, like a fossil cracked out of a 
stone. A simple, colorless glass sphere rests atop a 
stone pedestal in the center of this room.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The temperature of the Room is extreme-
ly hot, though this is an illusion. Characters spend-
ing too much time here suffer 1d4 damage (no 
save). Repeat this as often as necessary.
Turag and/or Boyikt do not trust this area of 
the dungeon. While they do not know this Room, 
they lost enough allies in this area that they will not 
enter. They will adamantly refuse, going so far as to 
fight a PC not to enter this Room.
A one-foot-diameter glass sphere rests atop an 
ornate pedestal. Glyphs and sigils cover the edges 
and legs. The glass appears to have something fiery 
inside, though it is blurry and unclear. It does not 
look humanoid but rather ghostly. Should a PC 
touch the sphere, the fire revenant inside ignites 
the PC’s hand and escapes into their body.
Encounter Condition: Extreme Heat, Smoke
Tactics: The PC appears to be on fire, but this is an 
illusion. The fire revenant is just a trickster spirit. It 
cannot harm the PC, but the PC will not know that. 
Each round, they will make contestsed Wisdom 
checks to see who controls the PC’s body for one 
turn. This continues until the PC has won three 
contests in a row or the PC is knocked unconscious.
Regardless, the revenant then escapes and dissi-
pates into steam. If the sphere is left in the Room, 
the fire revenant returns in one week. If the PCs 
take the sphere with them, it is extremely warm and 
heavy and makes for a nice centerpiece. Maybe it’s 
worth something.
Once the PCs have had a chance to rest, they 
realize the illusory fire damage isn’t real, and all 
of it heals, except for any damage the PCs dealt to 
one another.
Treasure: A careful examination of the angelic im-
print on the wall reveals a silver coin in the angel’s 
hand. It can be pried from the wall and taken as a 
fire token. Once removed, the coin feels thin and 
brittle. It is a one-use casting of fireball (6d6). The 
PCs won’t know exactly what it does until they flip/
hurl the coin.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
allow only half the damage to heal after a rest. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, allow the 
PCs to use the glass sphere to summon one fire 
elemental one time.
A84 . GREEN ICE 
The door to this Room is closed and cold to the 
touch. Anyone pushing open the door suffers 1d4 
cold damage. No save. Once the door is open, read 
the following.
The lighting inside the room is strange. There is an 
amber glow coming from somewhere, but it is 
unclear where the source is. The ceiling, floor, 
and walls of the Room are covered in a 
thin layer of translucent green ice. A 
simple dark gray box rests atop a 

87
stone pedestal in the center of this room. Two dead 
orcs lie at the foot of the pedestal.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The temperature of the Room is extreme-
ly cold. Characters spending too much time here 
suffer 1d4 damage (no save). Repeat this as often as 
necessary.
A one-foot-long dark gray stone box rests atop 
the ornate pedestal. Glyphs and sigils cover the 
edges and legs. The box has soft rounded edges, 
and it seems to devour both heat and light. The 
inside of the box is laced with cultivated yellow 
mold that bursts in a 10-ft. cloud when the box top 
is lifted.
 '
Box of Yellow Mold. A cloud of poisonous spores 
bursts forth. All living creatures within 10 ft. must 
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save or suffer 1d6 
points of immediate Constitution damage for 24 
hours. After 1 minute, they must succeed on the 
same save to avoid a further 2d6 points of imme-
diate Constitution damage. Creatures reduced 
to 0 Constitution die immediately. DC 16 Intelli-
gence (Investigation) check to find, DC 13 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools) check to disarm.
Note that even if a PC succeeds at the first 
check, he is still required to make the second save.
The lid of this box is weighted, so it always drops 
back down to close unless it is held open.
If either Turag and/or Boyikt are with the party, 
then either one of them can warn the PCs about 
the box (though the dead orcs should be warning 
enough). Whether they choose to do so, especially 
Turag, is another story.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: One of the keys the PCs found elsewhere 
in the dungeon opens the box without setting 
off the trap.
Treasure: A +2 ritual dagger rests inside the box. It 
cannot be held by evil or chaotic characters, how-
ever. Well. It can. But it does not confer a magical 
bonus to them.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
remove the dead orcs. To decrease the challenge of 
this encounter, reduce the damage of the mold to 
1d4 and 2d4.
A85 . SLEEP TRAP 
The southern door to this Room is closed and pulses 
with static electricity. Anyone pushing open the door 
suffers 1d4 lightning damage. No save.
The western door to this Room is closed and coated 
in a thick gray slime and some blood.
Once either door is open, read the following.
The lighting inside the room is strange. There is a 
purplish glow coming from somewhere, but it is 
unclear where the source is. The ceiling, floor, and 
walls of the Room are splattered with blood, fur, 
and bits of skin. An ivory tusk, less than a foot 
long, rests atop a stone pedestal in the center of 
this room. Two blackened pigs lie on the floor, guts 
splayed out, the bodies covered in maggots and 
flies. Oddly, there is no odor.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: There are two fiendish panthers resting 
in a corner of the Room. But the Room is so dark 
it has to make them out against the purple light 
(DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check). They have not 
touched the dead pigs and will not eat them.
On the pedestal is a tusk (see treasure). Should 
anyone touch it, a flare trap and sleep trap go 
off simultaneously — though the sleep trap only 
affects the PC touching the tusk. Whether the PCs 
successfully save against these trap effects or not, 
the flare negates the use of darkvision and low-light 
vision for 15 minutes.
 '
Flare Trap. Creatures within 20 ft. must succeed on 
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1 
minute. Trap resets after 1 round. DC 18 Wisdom 
(Perception) check to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Ar-
cana) check to disarm.
 '
Sleep Trap. Roll 7d8 to determine how many hit 
points of creatures this affects. Creatures within 
20 ft., starting with the creature with the lowest 
hit points, fall unconscious if the total roll exceeds 
their current hit point total. Each time a creature 
is affected, subtract their hit point total from the 
remaining pool before affecting the next creature.
Turag and/or Boyikt know nothing about these 
traps, but they have seen this Room configuration 

 88
before. They may or may not warn the PCs and defi-
nitely do not enter the Room.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), 
Concealment
Tactics: After the sleep trap triggers, the fiendish 
panthers spring into action and attack whoever is 
left standing, gaining surprise on the first round. 
Assuming, of course, the PCs didn’t spot the pan-
thers earlier.
Although aggressive, these fiendish panthers 
do not fight to the death. Being reduced to 50% 
or fewer starting hit points is enough to make a 
panther flee.
If healthy, the panthers pursue fleeing PCs.
Treasure: The tusk is carved with faint, archaic runes 
and shaped like a weapon, complete with pommel. 
It is a dagger of venom, radiating faint necromancy, 
and is evil, though it cannot be thrown like a nor-
mal dagger of venom.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add darkness to the trap that triggers one round 
after flare. In addition, having never seen the Room 
before, Turag and/or Boyikt consider the Room 
safe. To decrease the challenge, remove the sur-
prise round.
A86 . REFUSE ROOM 
The secret door at the end of the western hallway is 
easy to find, as the smell of garbage seeps through 
the cracks in the door. It rotates on a central pintel 
but is rather wide when opened. 
There is no door to this Room. The smell starts long 
before the PCs reach the doorway.
A bubbling mass of garbage covers most of the 
floor. The smell is unbelievably bad. Here and there, 
the handle of a broken tool or piece of furniture 
peeks out from the morass. Rotting matter is 
everywhere. Dead rats can be seen on top of the 
trash. The sounds of rats under the surface can 
also be heard.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This place is a refuse heap and, except 
for a 15-ft.-by-10-ft. area in front of the hallway, is 
filled knee-high with garbage. The bubbling of the 
garbage is caused by three fiendish rats swarms (hp 
18, 16, 13) moving beneath the filth. 
The smell is bad enough to require a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw as the PCs approach the 
Room. Failure indicates that the PC is considered 
poisoned while within range of or inside this Room 
(the poisoned condition lifts 1d4 rounds after exit-
ing the area).
Any PC spending more than a single round in 
the Room is also subject to catching an airborne 
variant of filth fever.
 '
Filth Fever. DC 11 Constitution save. On a failure: 
in 1d3 days, Dexterity and Constitution are each 
reduced by 1d4 until the disease is removed. Repeat 
save every 8 hours. Filth Fever ends after three con-
secutive successful DC 11 Constitution saves.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The fiendish rat swarms are busy rooting 
through the garbage and have a tough time notic-
ing the PCs (disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks), especially since the strong garbage smell 
completely masks the PCs’ odor from the rodents’ 
scent ability. Of course, once the PCs are noticed, a 
general squeaking alarm echoes as rat waves rush 
out from the garbage.
The fiendish rat swarms vigorously defend the 
trash pile and chase the PCs out of the Room if 
they flee.
The swarms flow over the adventurers, covering 
as many PCs as possible in their 10-ft.-by-10-ft. 
area. Only one fiendish rat swarm may cause dam-
age to a given PC each round, even if he is within 
the space occupied by two swarms; there simply 
isn’t enough space.
In addition to the smell and the disease, the gar-
bage signals an additional danger. Over the years, it 
has been outgassing, and given the tepid nature of 
the air in the dungeon, this gas has been building 
up. The churning of the fiendish rat swarms has 
released this gas, which represents a great hazard 
at this point. Any open flame (such as a torch or 
spell such as burning hands) that enters the area 
ignites the gas. This creates a non-magical 5d6 
fireball that covers the entire Room plus the first 10 
ft. of the hallway (Dexterity saving throw, DC 15 for 
half damage). 
PCs without the scent ability have trouble 
distinguishing the smell of gas from the smell of 
garbage unless they succeed at a DC 18 Intelligence 

89
(Nature) check or a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check. Any creature with the scent ability can figure 
out that gas is present. Note that just because a PC 
notices the gas does not mean that the fire hazard 
becomes evident. 
Treasure: A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals 
a +1 longsword among the debris, should anyone 
be brave enough to dig into the trash, though this 
risks disease again.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a fourth fiendish rat swarm. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, decrease the fireball 
damage to 3d6.
A87 . SECURE PRISON 
The door to this Room is closed and trapped with two 
traps. The first trap is a scything blade trap. Pushing 
the door open releases the blade, which is located 
on the interior wall next to the doorframe, so that it 
swings down and cuts the hand of anyone pushing 
open the door. A hidden bolt near the top of the door 
can be slid into place to block the blade from falling 
(DC 15 Wisdom check to find). A counterweight resets 
the trap the moment the blade has finished its path 
of travel.
 '
Scything Blade Trap: +6 to hit, one target, 3d8 slashing 
damage. DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.
The second trap is a lightning trap that triggers 
whenever a Tiny or larger creature crosses the thresh-
old. The lightning strikes down from the lintel to 
the floor and can affect only the creature within the 
doorframe at the time of the triggering.
 '
Lightning Trap. Deals 5d8 lightning damage. Crea-
tures take half damage on a successful DC 15 
Dexterity saving throw. DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to find, DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana) check to 
disarm. Resets after 1 round.
Any humanoids with the PCs are unable to 
tell about the exact nature of the traps. They can 
share with them the fact that it is more than likely 
trapped. If they so choose.
 Once the PCs open the door, read the following. 
This was clearly a prison cell at one time — shack-
les everywhere — and then refurbished as an 
armory. The large room is home to a number of 
weapons mounted on the wall. From polearms to 
swords, from axes to bows, the collection seems to 
be missing nothing. In addition, a number of suits 
of armor also hang about the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: N/A
Encounter Condition: Drafty
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: The weapons themselves are actually well 
taken care of and can be put to use immediately. In 
addition, each weapon is etched in both dwarven 
and giant runes, providing the origin and name of 
the weapon. The weapons are considered unique 
masterpieces worthy of gifts to kings. Depending 
on how much treasure the PCs have amassed so 
far, the GM should consider making one or two 
items magical.
The following arms and armors are readily avail-
able (each item appears only once).
Tailored for a Derro: Studded leather armor, buckler, 
short sword, repeating light crossbow (a light cross-
bow without the loading tag), and a vial of green 
blood oil hanging from a chain on the crossbow.
Tailored for a Drow: chain shirt, light shield, rapier, 
hand crossbow, a vial (single dose) of Drow poison 
hanging from a gold chain that, in turn, hangs 
from the chain shirt. 
 '
Drow Poison. On a hit, the target must succeed on 
a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be rendered 
unconscious for 1 minute. At the end of 1 minute, 
the affected creature can repeat the save. On a fail, 
the creature is unconscious for 24 hours.
Tailored for a Duergar: chainmail, heavy shield, war-
hammer, light crossbow.
Tailored for a Dwarf: scale mail, heavy shield, war axe, 
short bow.
Tailored for a Human: chainmail, medium shield, 
longsword, light mace.
Tailored for a Kobold: leather, spear, sling.
Tailored for an Orc: studded leather armor, fal-
chion, javelin.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the lightning trap to 7d8. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, decrease 
the damage of the lightning trap to 3d8.

A88 .-A93 . THE LAIR 
The rather large chambers from Room A88 to A93 
were used as everything from living quarters to 
prison dens to workshops. Although the humanoids 
freely explored these areas, they were considered 
too large by either side to defend properly and were 
generally left alone.
The presence of a community is still obvious. The 
accumulated debris of years of occupation litters the 
floor (disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in 
these Rooms), and the sharp eye can make out non-
sense graffiti. 
Currently these Rooms are proving an attractive site 
to a large swarm of fiendish darkmantles; the flying 
beasts find the open spaces a pleasure to be in. Each 
member has selected an area and only leaves it to go 
hunting in the dungeon.
If any of the orcs from Room A81 are with the PCs, 
they are all too familiar with the area, having retreat-
ed through. They gladly and ferociously attack any 
fiendish darkmantles they encounter. 
A88 . LAIR ENTRANCE 
Both doors to this Room are open. 
The floor of this large room is covered with debris, 
and settled dust coats everything. Three hulking 
shapes can be seen in the darkness on the other 
side of the room.
Should the PCs take their eyes off the beasts in this 
Room, they notice:
Footprints cut through the dirty floor, indicating 
someone was here recently. Someone without 
shoes. They came in from the south and exited 
through the door in the north. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Three fiendish axe beaks currently occupy 
this Room. They entered through the opposite door 
from the PCs a few moments ago. In addition to 
the axe beaks, include any creatures that may have 
retreated from Rooms A89 and A90.
Once the PCs move further into the Room, they 
notice a couple of orc corpses lying against the op-
posite wall. They would have been food for the axe 
beaks, but now they have the PCs to contend with.
Encounter Condition: Concealment
Tactics: The fiendish axe beaks are in an uneasy truce 
with each other and keep a wary eye out. Because of 
this, they do not work as a team and roll initiative 
separately. 
Although aggressive, these fiendish ax beaks do 
not fight to the death. There are two exits, so it is 
easy for one to make an escape if/when reduced to 
half hit points. They do not respond to the sounds 
of combat in Room A89 or Room A90, but should 
they retreat into Room A89, they join the fiendish 
forces there.
If the PCs retreat, the fiendish ax beaks do 
not follow.
If the PCs attempt to close the doors in this 
Room, the fiendish ax beaks are quite capable of 
opening them again. 
Treasure: A DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
reveals a tattered sack wedged into a corner of 
the Room and covered with dirt. It is filled with 23 
small polished gems, each worth about 5 to 10 gp 
each. They are the treasure of a kobold who hid 
them from the rest of the humanoids, but he never 
returned for them.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two fiendish darkmantles waiting to drop on 
wounded PCs. To decrease the challenge of this 
encounter, remove one fiendish ax beak.
A89 . ANCILLARY LAIR 
Both doors to this Room are open.
The floor of this large room is covered with dust 
and debris. Dead flying octopi litter the floor. A 
trio of wild boars feed on the carcass, treating it 
like a toy. Other large pieces of meat are scattered 
around the room. Two large rats feed on something 
in the corner.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: Three fiendish wild boars and two 
fiendish dire rats make their home here. They have 
made their way down from Room A103, killing and 
replacing darkmantles as they go, and now feed 
on the dead.

91
Rotting, dismembered orc corpses and dead 
fiendish darkmantles indicate there was a fight 
here. And either the boars were in on the fight, or 
they are enjoying the leftovers.
Encounter Condition: Concealment, Cover
Tactics: No one is looking for a fight. They have 
plenty to eat, but all of the fiendish wild boars take 
a defensive stance when the PCs enter. The plans of 
the dire rats are not immediately known. They wait 
to respond to the PC’s actions. Anything overtly ag-
gressive sends the fiendish dire rats to the opposite 
doorway, joining forces with whoever is in Room 
A88 or Room A89.
The wild boars charge on the first round of com-
bat, gaining an advantage on their attack and 
damage rolls.
Treasure: Searching through the decaying orc corps-
es, the PCs find 15 sp, a whetstone, four hatchets, 
and a preserved plum in a dirty sack. It is unclear 
how the plum has not rotted yet. Is it magical?
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one additional fiendish wild boar and have 
them fight aggressively. To decrease the challenge 
of this encounter, remove the dire rats.
A90 . LARGER HORRORS 
Both doors to this Room are open. 
Debris and dust cover this abandoned room. Some 
furniture or crates were here once. It is unclear. All 
of the wood has been smashed beyond recognition. 
Four wolves with black fur tug and pull at the 
remains of a recently deceased kobold. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: In addition to the wolves, include any 
creatures that may have retreated from Rooms 
A88 and A89. 
Three fiendish darkmantles and dire rats are 
dead on the ground, obviously killed a while ago. 
But the kobold’s body is fresh, and the wolves 
want that.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Though playing tug of war with the kobold 
corpse, these fiendish wolves work as a team in 
battle, circling around a single enemy if they can. 
They are not timid and are unlikely to run. They 
gain advantage on any fear-based saving throw 
and work with any creatures that retreated into 
this Room.
The largest wolf performs a special trip attack on 
the second round of combat, attempting to get the 
largest PC on the ground. This is a special grapple 
requiring a contested Strength check, which the 
fiendish wolf gets a +3 on. If successful, the PC falls 
prone, and another wolf can attack him.
If the trip attempt fails, the wolf does not 
try it again.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two additional fiendish wolves who perform 
the special trip attack on round one at advantage. 
To reduce the challenge of this encounter, remove 
one wolf and/or have retreating creatures continue 
through the north exit.

 92
A91 . THE STRONG SURVIVE 
All of the doors to this Room are open.
This is a complicated encounter with numerous 
creatures. Some retreating creatures may have made 
it here. GMs may want to scale this encounter back, 
regardless, or suffer numerous character deaths.
This is an extremely large chamber. Although debris 
covers the floor, several areas of higher traffic are 
visible from the numerous doors that lead in and 
out of this room. Numerous shapes can be seen 
through the haze of the room, the smell unmistak-
able and fiendish.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This is the largest and most centrally 
located Room in this part of the dungeon. Accord-
ingly, numerous fiendish creatures are here, trying 
to get their bearings, having just come through the 
gateway in Room A103.
Orc and kobold bodies litter the floor, along with 
numerous darkmantles, rats, stirges, and an out-of-
place goblin who stumbled in here from Region B.
Slightly bewildered, several fiendish creatures 
are here. One fiendish owl bear, two fiendish ax 
beaks, three fiendish wild boars, three fiendish 
darkmantles, three fiendish stirges, and four 
fiendish dire rats present, in addition to any re-
treating creatures.
The darkmantles and stirges hide in the ceiling 
rafters above, waiting for their opportunity. A DC 15 
Wisdom check is required to spot them.
Encounter Condition: Concealment
Tactics: The PCs cannot possibly surprise the crea-
tures in this Room if they fought in Room A90 
beforehand. Retreating monsters will alert them of 
combat. However, they are still confused and fight 
at disadvantage on the first round.
The fiendish owl bear is already wounded and 
covered in blood. It stands in the center of the 
Room, surveying who or what to attack first/next. 
The fiendish ax beaks keep their distance from the 
owlbear, keeping their eyes on the entering PCs. 
The two fiendish wild boars are already feeding on 
carcasses alongside the fiendish dire rats.
The fiendish darkmantles are wounded from 
a previous fight and wait on the ceiling for an 
opportunity to feed. The fiendish stirges, while not 
wounded, are hungry and waiting for their moment 
to strike. These two creatures are the most likely to 
retreat north or west if things get too hairy.
Because of the scale of this encounter, it is 
broken down round by round, assuming specific 
creatures are alive that long. All creature types roll 
initiative separately.
On round one, the owl bear attacks a nearby 
wild boar. The ax beaks close the gap with the PCs 
but do not attack. The boars charge the first PC, 
attempting to take them down. The dire rats retreat 
to a safe corner and wait.
On round two, the owl bear turns its attention 
to the PCs, charging into the fray as if someone has 
used magic on it. The ax beaks attack whoever is 
closest while the wild boars push through the party. 
If a PC has been separated and exposed, one of the 
darkmantles and two of the stirges attack. At the 
end of the round, one of the darkmantles bathes 
the room in darkness, regardless.
In round three, the owl bear fights the closest 
thing it can find. The same goes for the ax beaks 
and boars. All of the darkmantles descend on who-
ever is weakest. The stirges do not hesitate to mob 
a single PC.
On round four, whoever is left standing contin-
ues to fight.
On round five, monsters start to retreat. Anyone 
with less than half hit points makes a run for it. 
They most likely head west, but the dire rats know 
of the food in Room A92 and retreat there. If any 
PCs have fallen, the boars and rats are the first to 
feed on their bodies. The stirges want fresh blood.
Treasure: There is likely to be some coinage among 
the dead bodies but little else of value. The gob-
lin wears a necklace with a key-shaped pendant 
on it. It is unclear what it goes to, but nothing in 
this Region.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two more fiendish dire rats. To decrease the 
challenge of this encounter, remove all of the fiend-
ish stirges.

93
A92 . NOWHERE TO HIDE
The door to this Room is open. 
The floor of this L-shaped room is covered with 
the usual debris, including bone, blood, and broken 
weapons. The number of dead bodies indicates this 
was a final holdout for the orcs, who took many 
creatures with them.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was the final holdout against 
the fiendish creatures. Whatever remained of the 
orcs died here, their bodies chewed on by their ene-
mies. If the fight in A91 becomes too much, the PCs 
or the fiendish creatures may fall back here.
One of the dead orcs died of disease and 
shows no sign of battle wounds. His gear remains 
untouched, though perhaps still affected by the 
black mold.
Encounter Condition: Fear 12
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: N/A 
A93 . ANNEX
The door to this Room is open. 
The melted body of two flying octopus creatures 
lie in the doorway. They are splayed open and still 
warm, as though the fight just happened. Beyond, 
the area appears to have been a ready room. Bro-
ken arrows, spear tips, discarded swords, and the 
like lay scattered across the dirty floor. The smell of 
dank air and sweat lingers as though the room is 
still crowded with orcs and other humanoids.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Boyikt (Room A34) killed these fiendish 
darkmantles with a flaming sphere during a costly 
battle before he retreated north. The rest of the bro-
ken weapons were part of Longtail’s mustering of 
forces before marching on the chapel. These events 
did not happen at the same time.
The Room is filled with a number of potential 
storylines, including a troglodyte who is still in 
hiding or a lost kobold who doesn’t want to fight 
anymore. The details are left to the GM’s discretion.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The Room is a great place for illusions, bad 
memories, and more fiendish creatures to explore. 
Keep the PCs guessing.
Treasure: A thick lump of unprocessed copper ore lies 
wedged into a corner next to a small shovel. It looks 
as though someone was trying to chip away the 
copper from the rock to no avail.
Scaling: N/A
A94 . ISOLATED ROOM 
The door to this Room is closed. Bright light shines 
from under the door.
As you open the door, the sound of silence reso-
nates. The Room is ablaze with a bright light that 
seems to come from nowhere. Your lids cannot 
bear the light, and you squint to almost blindness 
to shield your eyes. Blurry figures form inside the 
room. They wave their arms? Legs? It is hard to 
discern what is happening.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This Room was used as an isolation 
chamber. The sound dampening and bright magical 
light were seen as methods of punishment. While 
sound does travel through the Room, it is slow and 
never louder than 40 or 50 dB.
Once the PCs’ vision clears up, they can see 
a tense standoff between the three figures: two 
kobolds and an orc stare at one another, no one 
daring to move. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The humanoids are ready to throw down but 
turn their attention to the PCs, who may or may 
not be a threat. If the PCs start a fight, the orc and 
kobolds join forces against the party. Otherwise, the 
humanoids do not strike first.
If a fight does break out, everyone attacks at 
–2 penalty, plus any sunlight penalty their spe-
cies suffers.
There is an opportunity to talk things out, how-
ever. And while the orcs and kobolds will not join 
the PCs, they are happy to talk things out rather 
than fight. They are just so damned tired.
Treasure: N/A

 94
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one more orc and one more kobold. To de-
crease the challenge of the encounter, have the orc 
standing over the bloody bodies of the kobolds.
A95 . THE LONG ROOM 
The door to this Room is closed.
This long room appears quite empty except for the 
lone chest at the far wall and a single orc corpse 
lying next to it. The smell indicates the orc has been 
dead for some time. Something has chewed away 
at the bottom of his boots and feet. Along the back 
wall is a freshly painted mosaic in a crude style. It 
shows a town on fire with numerous little people 
running around.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: While the door is perfectly safe, and the 
chest is too, the ceiling above the chest is not. The 
actual trap is a scorching ray trap that activates the 
moment a Tiny or larger creature approaches within 
5 ft. of the chest.
 '
Scorching Ray Trap. Three rays of flame attack up to 
three targets within 10 ft. +6 to hit, 2d6 damage per 
ray. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) to notice, DC 20 
Intelligence (Arcana) to disarm. Automatically resets 
after 10 minutes.
Encounter Condition: Fog 10
Tactics: If any humanoids are with the PCs, they have 
heard of the long Room with the lone chest. While 
they don’t know the chest is empty, they can, if they 
choose, warn the PCs of the trap.
Treasure: The chest is unlocked and empty. A thor-
ough search reveals a false bottom filled with nu-
merous gold and silver coins from a dozen different 
empires. There are over 100 gp worth of coins, but 
they are worth even more to a collector.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of the trap, add an-
other ray to each triggering of the trap. To decrease 
the challenge of the trap, change the scorching ray 
to a burning hands trap.
A96 . LIGHT AND LIZARDFOLK 
The door to this Room is closed and warded with 
a fire trap. It was placed on the door by Slissth, the 
lizardfolk druid, and triggers the moment someone 
opens the door. The trap is designed to alert the 
lizardfolk and give them time to prepare for intruders 
rather than kill anyone. 
 '
Fire Trap Deals 3d6 fire damage in a 5-foot radius. 
Creatures take half damage on a successful DC 10 
Dexterity saving throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
to disarm.
Read the following text once the PCs open the door.
Something scrapes across the ground as you push 
open the door. To your surprise, you see light within 
this room, not the flickering light of a torch but 
a solid, steady light. And the ominous sound of 
something moving...
If the lizardfolk have had time to prepare, read the 
following.
A hot, fiery green sphere lights up in front of you, 
catching some of you ablaze.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent 
Encounter: The reason for the scraping noise is a 
couple of rocks that have been wedged against the 
door for precisely this purpose. The rocks slow the 
opening of the door (it takes one full round to open 
the door after the discharge of the fire trap), and 
they also provide a warning to the room’s occupants 
in case the fire trap is somehow bypassed. 
The two lizardfolk are the guides that led Long-
tail’s expedition to this dungeon. They rest here 
while weighing their options. Although they resist-
ed entering the dungeon, they were forced to do so 
when the fiendish wererat refused payment. Once 
inside, they were trapped like all the rest.
The duo initially kept to themselves, living on 
the fringe of the reptilian settlement as the other 
humanoids explored the place. When the conflict 
broke out between the troglodytes and orcs, the 
lizardfolk sided with the troglodytes out of necessi-
ty. However, they were of limited use given their re-
liance on light and were fortunate not to be killed. 
With the appearance of the beasts, the duo sought 
their escape from this Region as quickly as possible 
and recently made their way here.
Both lizardfolk wear continual flame pendants, 
which are the lizardfolk’s most vital possession. 

95
Without them, they would be unable to navigate 
their way through the dungeon.
Encounter Condition: Soft Cover
Tactics: Both Kalhiss and Slissth are sitting across 
from the doorway, and as soon as they hear sounds 
in the hall, they prepare themselves. The odds of 
hearing anything beyond the closed door are slim 
(disadvantage to the lizardfolks’ Perception checks 
due to the door and distance), but they definitely 
hear the discharge of the fire trap (unless it was 
disarmed).
If time permits, Kalhiss readies his bow and 
holds an action triggered by the first creature that 
comes through the door while Slissth casts flaming 
sphere (green-colored) and rolls it toward the door-
way. Slissth stops the flaming sphere in the doorway, 
forcing any creature trying to move into the Room 
to get past it while Kalhiss fires arrows at any crea-
ture that tries.
After, Slissth prepares to cast green flame blade 
and moves to deal with any creatures that survive 
the flames and Kalhiss’ arrows, leaving the flaming 
sphere in the doorway. Slissth’s animal companion, 
a medium viper (T’lakiss), coils around Slissth’s 
shoulders. It defends the druid by biting any crea-
ture that engages in melee with the druid.
Once the lizardfolk recognize that it is the PCs 
and not some humanoids or obviously bestial 
denizen of the dungeon that opened the door, 
they hesitate a moment in their attacks. They call 
out to stop, but the PCs may not hear them over 
the clamor.
If the PCs attack, the lizardfolk defend them-
selves to the death if need be. If the PCs also 
halt their actions and request a parley or other-
wise stand down, the lizardfolk are willing to talk 
(Slissth keeps the flaming sphere in the doorway, 
just in case).
The lizardfolk know that their chances of sur-
viving in a dungeon environment are slim at best, 
and the appearance of the PCs gives them greater 
hope. They are willing to forge an alliance, assum-
ing that the PCs prove themselves trustworthy. You 
can use a Charisma (Persuasion) check based on 
the lizardfolk attitude of indifferent (DC 13) if you 
don’t want to roleplay the exchange. Give the check 
disadvantage if there are other humanoids with the 
PCs. Even if the result of the check is a failure, the 
lizardfolk still ally themselves with the PCs, though 
cautiously. 
The lizardfolk are the most reliable allies the PCs 
can find in this Region. They kept themselves out 
of the fray and thus have made no enemies among 
any of the humanoids. Furthermore, they judge 
their allies on what they do, not what they say or 
who they are. The more the PCs help the lizardfolk, 
the more they help the PCs.
The lizardfolk are intelligent enough to realize 
that if the PCs are traveling with orcs or kobolds, it 
is out of necessity and not because they share the 
same outlook on life. Thus, it is quite possible that 
if and when the other humanoids turn on the PCs, 
the lizardfolk will stand by their new allies.
Because these two kept their distance from the 
other humanoids, they know little about the in-
ner workings of the other humanoid groups. They 
can tell about the journey to the dungeon but are 
unaware of the exact purpose that Longtail had in 
coming to the dungeon. They both suspect that it 
was he who released the extraplanar beasts. They 
cannot pinpoint the wererat’s location because they 
have not seen him, but Kalhiss knows that all the 
creatures have come from the northeast.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase Kalhiss’ and Slissth‘s levels by one or two. 
To decrease the challenge of this encounter, de-
crease Kalhiss’ and Slissth‘s levels by one or two.
A97 . TREASURE VAULT
The door to this Room is open and the doorway is 
trapped with a hypnotic trap and a burning hands 
trap, which trigger in succession. The traps trigger 
the moment any creature of Tiny size or larger enters 
the doorway.
 '
Hypnotic Trap. Creatures within 15 ft. of the doorway 
must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or 
be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed by this 
effect, the creature is convinced there is nothing 
worthwhile in the room and no reason to enter 
it. Indeed, they actively persuade other creatures 
to leave the place alone, claiming a vision of hid-
eous monsters inside, waiting to consume any 
who enter.

 96
 '
Burning Hands Trap. 3d6 fire damage. Creatures take 
half damage on a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving 
throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, 
DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. Auto-
matically resets after 1 round. Note. A PC charmed 
by the hypnotism trap cannot save against this 
fire damage. 
A couple of broken crates are all that remain of 
interest in this otherwise empty room.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This was a minor treasure vault. While 
not one of the great repositories of wealth within 
the dungeon, it still contains a considerable sum 
of money. The effectiveness of the hypnotic trap 
means none of the region’s inheritors ever made 
it inside. Quite the opposite, in fact; if there are 
any humanoid inhabitants of the dungeon with 
the characters, they say they’ve heard of this room 
before–of its horrifying reputation... no one, they 
say, has ever entered and returned alive. The fact is, 
none ever entered in the first place, but the story 
has grown in the telling.
Encounter Condition: Negative Energy
Tactics: Roll for a random encounter once the trap 
has been triggered. If creature(s) are rolled, they are 
stuck inside the Room, unwilling to risk the trap 
again. They cannot be surprised and are ready to 
fight once the traps have been sprung.
Treasure: 4000 gp in a number of chests, along with 
eight small rubies (5 gp each) and a signet ring 
bearing the crest of the dungeon’s original creators 
(worth 200 gp to the right antiquarian).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the traps affect two PCs. To decrease the 
challenge of the encounter, remove the Burning 
Hands trap.
A98 . FORGOTTEN TORTURE 
CHAMBER
The door to this Room is closed and trapped. The 
doorway is trapped with a hold person trap and a 
burning hands trap, which trigger in succession. The 
traps trigger the moment any Tiny or larger crea-
ture enters the doorway. It only affects the creature 
in the door.
If there are any dungeon denizens (kobolds, orcs, etc.) 
with the PCs, they do not know the exact nature of 
the trap. They do know that there are a lot of traps in 
this area — a fact they may or may not share with the 
PCs. Turag (Room A28), for instance, may decide to let 
the PCs walk into a trap without giving a warning.
 '
Hold Person Trap. An affected target must succeed 
on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed 
for 1 minute. Trap resets after 1 minute.
 '
Burning Hands Trap. 3d6 fire damage. Creatures take 
half damage on a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving 
throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, 
DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. Auto-
matically resets after 1 round. Note. A PC paralyzed 
by the hold person trap cannot save against this 
fire damage. 
Several skeletons sit against the wall, the shackles 
that held them to their fate still on their wrists. A 
dead orc lies just beyond the trap, face down, his 
clothing singed and burned.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was used as a torture chamber 
and its shackled inhabitants were left there to die. 
The orc died at the hands of the trap and no other 
orcs followed him in.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The orc has a small pouch with six small 
stones. The stones are semi-magical, providing pure 
mana for spells. Each stone can substitute for any 
one magical component of any spell up to 3rd level. 
The orc also has a +1 dagger hidden in his boot.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the traps affect two PCs. To decrease 
the challenge of the encounter, give the orc a +1 
shield as well.
A99 . EMPTY VAULT 
The door to this Room is closed. 
A couple of broken crates lay about this barren 
room. An empty barrel is tipped over and nes-
tled inside a chipped groove in the stonework. A 
thin human sleeps against the southeast corner, 

97
wrapped in an old blanket. His eyes slowly open as 
you enter the room.
Initial Attitude: Varies 
Encounter: This was a minor storage vault. Although 
it was once trapped, the trap has since failed, and 
the door is perfectly safe.
A human (Nylinn) hides from the creatures 
in this Section. He was part of a larger group of 
adventurers who were attacked and killed by orcs 
and kobolds. He was able to survive and make it 
to safety.
He was unable to lock the door behind himself, 
as the door was damaged. Nylinn is cold, tired, 
and suffering from a nasty, untreated wound in his 
back. He initially hides this from the PCs, believing 
they might choose to leave him behind if he can’t 
take care of himself. 
Encounter Condition: Echoes 6, Safe
Tactics: Depending on the GM’s preferences and the 
needs of the game, Nylinn might be one of any 
number of people. 
 
Option 1) Nylinn is a friendly NPC with the 
potential to become a PC. If so, he has no char-
acter class until a player takes him on. He doesn’t 
know much about the dungeon and only came 
following rumors of treasure, though the fact 
other adventurers are searching for the gold or 
that the PCs’ employers sent other people down 
here might set up some intriguing complications 
further down the line.
 
Option 2) Nylinn is a 4th-level rogue and a rival 
NPC adventurer. This does not make him an 
enemy of the PCs outright. Their goals may align. 
He was hired by the church to retrieve a lost book 
of rituals stolen by Longtail. He’s made it this far 
into the dungeon because he is competent and 
quiet. He travels alone because it’s easy to infil-
trate that way. He is not aware that he is stuck 
in the dungeon, though, but he is aware of the 
various non-troglodyte factions in the Region. 
He does not know where Longtail is. He prom-
ises the PCs to stay out of their way and, if they 
seem amenable, offers information about Long-
tail (or something else of interest to the PCs) in 
exchange for healing. He might tell the PCs about 
the relationship between Longtail and Achsyyx or 
about the treasure in Room A97. He might prove 
a useful ally at some point later in the adventure if 
the PCs are struggling and the GM feels the need 
to help them out. 
 
Option 3) Nylinn is a 3rd-level human warlock. 
The cat from Room A59 is his. He wants his 
familiar back if the PCs have it. This could lead to 
a fight. If the PCs do not have the cat, he may or 
may not ever bring up his familiar, presuming it is 
dead. He offers to accompany the PCs for a share 
of the profits, both for himself and for his cat. He 
is endearingly haughty and much less intelligent 
than he believes himself to be.
Note: The humanoids and lizardfolk know who 
Nylinn is. If you go this route, be prepared for the 
consequences.
Unless the GM chooses for Nylinn to be Long-
tail, no stats are provided. GMs are welcome to 
come up with other reasons for Nylinn being here.
Treasure: Nylinn’s treasure varies, depending on 
which version of him the GM decides to include in 
the adventure.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give Nylinn a wolf as an animal companion in ad-
dition to his cat familiar. To decrease the challenge 
of this encounter, Nylinn does not wake up when 
the PCs enter. However, this only matters if the PCs 
choose to fight him.
This scaling is strange. It requires some fore-
thought on the GM’s part. Before the encounter 
commences, the GM will have to determine how 
powerful the PCs are compared to Nylinn. If a 
wolf companion is present, that will have to be 
described. Even if the PCs do not intend to fight 
Nylinn, it will still be necessary to gauge relative 
strengths.

 98
A100-A104 . THE CHAPEL 
Rooms A100 to A104 contain the long-forgotten 
chapel as well as some ancillary Rooms. The chap-
el was abandoned ages ago, and because this area 
is effectively isolated, the humanoids never both-
ered with it.
All of these encounters are fights. The GM should 
plan these encounters ahead and not just open the 
book the day the PCs encounter these Rooms.
Currently, Longtail and Achsyyx make the chapel 
their home. The wererat has isolated himself from 
the other factions, now a victim of his own ambi-
tions. The PCs most likely encounter them separately, 
though merciless GMs may have them fight the PCs 
together or, at the very least, come to the other’s aid 
(Rooms A101 and A103).
In addition, a fiendish owlbear is rampaging 
through the area completely out of control.
Random encounters do not occur in this Section.
A100 . PRISONER HOLDING CELL
The door to this Room has been smashed open. Be-
fore the PCs get too close, they can hear the sounds 
of combat and bestial shrieks from inside.
Note: This is a difficult and complicated encounter.
The door has been smashed open, lying broken and 
off its hinges. A mixture of splintered wood and 
twisted metal bands lie scattered in the doorway. 
Despite the gloom, it is possible to discern the 
carnage within.
A huge, feathered monstrosity with a raptor’s head 
utters horrid shrieks as it rampages through the 
room. Fresh blood sticks to its coat, and it carries a 
flying octopus clutched in one claw, entrails hang-
ing from its beak. At least half a dozen more flying 
octopi lie dead around it, their bodies torn open. 
Another, obviously heavily wounded, flies about the 
room in panic. Small empty force cages line the walls.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This is the latest creature to step through 
the ‘doorway’ opened by Longtail. Enraged beyond 
reason, the fiendish owlbear kills anything in its 
path. The darkmantles had the misfortune to be 
resting here when the fiendish owlbear emerged.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The fiendish owlbear is enraptured by its 
bloodlust and is enjoying the destruction of the 
much weaker fiendish creatures, much as it enjoyed 
the killing of the humanoids in Rooms A101 and 
A102. It is momentarily distracted by its quest for 
the last remaining fiendish creatures and does not 
immediately notice the PCs. This is compounded 
by the low light within the room. At the start of the 
encounter, the fiendish owlbear has disadvantage 
on all Perception checks related to sight, unless the 
PCs possess a light source.
Once it spots the PCs, it attacks the nearest, 
swatting with its claws and biting with its beak. Due 
to its damage reduction, it has not been seriously 
hurt or challenged and thinks nothing of the insig-
nificant creatures that come into its field of vision.
Despite its evident rage, the fiendish owlbear 
is not stupid. If an opponent manages to deal 10 
or more damage in a single turn (after applying 
resistances), the fiendish owlbear turns its atten-
tion solely toward that individual and can pursue it 
without drawing attacks of opportunity. In any case, 
once hurt, it focuses its efforts solely on those who 
have hurt it and ignores those who haven’t. Fur-
thermore, if reduced to one-half of its hit points or 
fewer, it attempts to escape, bull-rushing and oth-
erwise fighting its way out of the Room and down 
the hall; it only fights to the death as a last resort.
The moment the fiendish owlbear is distract-
ed, the remaining fiendish darkmantle flees as 
best it can.  
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the fiendish owlbear’s hp to 92. To decrease 

99
the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish 
owlbear already injured at the hands of Longtail 
(see Room A104). It starts instead with 57 hit points.
A101 . HIDEOUT 
As the PCs approach this Room, from either direc-
tion, read the following.
Nearly a dozen orc and kobold bodies lie strewn 
across the hallway, vicious slash marks on their 
bodies. Three dead orcs are pressed against the 
iron-bound door as if trying to get in.
The door to this Room is locked and barred from 
the inside. Longtail has sealed himself inside and 
left the others to deal with the owlbear. A DC 20 
Strength check is required to bash it in. Unlocking 
it requires a DC10 Dexterity (Sleight-of-Hand) check 
but does nothing.
The PCs may bypass this Room because they cannot 
get in. There is nothing wrong with this. Longtail can 
be a long-term problem for Region B and Region 
E. But as the PCs advance in level, the GM needs to 
advance Longtail’s stats as well.
A large, surprisingly clean chamber confronts you. 
A pile of empty crates and barrels are clumsily 
stacked in the center of the room, swaying slightly. 
The room’s only occupant stands behind the tower 
— a single wererat staring you down in a defensive 
posture. He looks angry, like someone having a very 
bad day. You suddenly feel sleepy...
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The orcs and kobolds were part of the 
small expedition that Longtail led to search for the 
chapel. They were killed by the owlbear when told to 
hold the door. Longtail is desperate now, not know-
ing who the PCs are or why they’ve come, but being 
generally paranoid, he initially assumes they’re here 
to assassinate him.
Longtail has stacked some empty barrels and 
some broken-down crates in the center of the Room 
to use as cover. It is haphazard and makeshift, but it’ll 
do the trick in a pinch.
A number of things are about to happen as the 
PCs enter the Room. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: There is virtually no way for Longtail to 
be surprised by the PCs. He moves to confront 
them as soon as he is properly prepared. Either 
he heard them coming in, or Achsyyx has already 
warned him.
The wererat is already in hybrid form and stays 
that way throughout the encounter. If Longtail is 
disguised as Nylinn and traveling with the PCs, this 
is his opportunity to escape to Room A104.
The moment he hears the PCs bashing on the 
door, Longtail dons his goggles of night before 
casting expeditious retreat and guidance on himself, 
then moving to either the left or right hall doorway, 
depending on which one the PCs are furthest from.
Once the door opens, Longtail casts sleep and 
attempts to snipe at the remaining PCs using magic 
missile or his wand. If there are too many enemies 
closing in on him, he uses his superior speed to 
evade or retreat to Room A102. If things get too 
tight, he can use fly and invisibility to buy himself 
some space.
Although Longtail opened the gateway, the dis-
appointing results have left him less than eager to 
fight for its possession. As long as things go his way 
in a fight, he is happy to duke it out. But if he is 
reduced to one-half or fewer hit points, he retreats.
He hides from the PCs within the dungeon, 
waiting for them to leave. If Achsyyx is still alive, he 
may join Longtail after the fight begins. However, If 
Longtail must, he leaves Achsyyx to make his own 
way. Only if escape is impossible, or he is about to 
die, does Longtail offer a truce, hoping to leave on 
his own terms. If even this prospect is dim, then he 
will beg for surrender.
If allowed to live and/or escape, Longtail heads 
north to Region E. He doesn’t know what is there. 
It’s just a random direction he’s headed in. Howev-
er, the parlay between Longtail and the PCs is likely 
to be lengthy and involve some negotiation.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give Longtail haste instead of fly and have invisibil-
ity already cast before the PCs arrive. In addition, 
add a fiendish rat swarm under his command. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, allow 
Longtail only two unused spell slots per level and 
reduce his hit point total by 20 (he has already had a 
run-in with the owlbear).

A102 . HOLDOUT 
The door to this Room is open and shows signs 
of having been hammered against. If Longtail has 
retreated to this Room, he may close the door and try 
to lock it, taking an action to do so. If locked, the PCs 
can bash it open with a DC 14 Strength check or pick 
the lock with a DC 15 Dexterity check.
Large basins and tubs fill the room. Ritual glyphs 
and sigils line the walls. Several basins are cracked 
or broken open completely. One massive tub is 
raised and made of brass or bronze. Angelic heads 
are carved into all the bas-relief features. Water 
trickles, almost magically, from a font raised high 
against the south wall. It flows into each tub 
and basin. The excess water drains into cracks in 
the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: There is only an encounter here if Long-
tail has retreated.
This was a ritual bathing area. Symbols of pu-
rification are etched carefully into the walls. They 
have stood the test of time. Several deities names 
are also etched on the wall. Pick some from your 
home campaign.
A shelf in the southeast corner has rusted ritual 
daggers on it. The shelf above that has places for 
soap and brushes is now long gone.
Along the southern wall are holy, non-magical 
glyphs and pictographs showing the eight stages of 
ritual cleansing. None of them mention the dag-
gers, which begs the question. Why not?
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Longtail’s tactics remain the same. He at-
tempts to flee if he can. Otherwise, he tries to work 
an angle for peace. If that doesn’t work, he uses 
the broken basins and tubs as cover as he fights at 
a distance.
Treasure: Holy vestments hang on hooks throughout. 
They are covered in the same sigils as those on the 
walls and tubs. If worn, the vestments grant a +2 on 
saving throws against evil creatures. 
Scaling: N/A 
A103 . THE LONG-FORGOTTEN 
CHAPEL
The two doors along the southern wall are closed. 
When the PCs stand in the northern portion of the 
chapel, shrieking noises echo from the east.
The secret door to the west is a one-way secret door 
that can only be opened from inside Room A103. 
The door cannot be pulled open from the other side. 
Unlike standard secret doors, this door is hinged on 
one side and requires less effort to open via a DC 12 
Strength check. It is also fairly noticeable from the 
inside. When fully open, the door provides 4 feet 
of space, enough for a Medium creature in armor 
to pass through. The doors at the southern end 
are closed. 
Large plain pillars that reach to the ceiling sit 
every ten feet in this room. A swirling oblong 
vortex of black and red sits against the northern 
wall, pulsing with eldritch energy. A handful of the 
flying octopi lie on the floor, obviously charred and 
eviscerated.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This is the chapel that Longtail sought af-
ter. All adornments and decorations were removed 
when the chapel was abandoned and neglected 
by practitioners centuries ago. A few etchings on 
the wall indicate the place was once dedicated to 
a god of distance, of doorways, and of forgotten 
parents. The dead fiendish darkmantles were killed 
by Longtail.
The swirling vortex is the gateway to an extrad-
imensional pocket — a minor hell chiefly reserved 
for hunters and incompetent dungeoneers (hence 
the preponderance of vicious animals). Initially 
considered a minor nuisance, the fiendish beasts 
were kept trapped inside this Room. That pocket 
ruptured when the earthquake happened, and this 
part of the prison was abandoned.
It was Achsyyx who realized that a human hand 
was needed to dispel the magic on the grif-
fon-shaped lock that still held some magic on the 
gateway. Without Longtail, the fiendish creatures 
would have to wait hundreds more years. 
And Achsyyx had grown impatient.
As Longtail’s familiar, Achsyyx knew it could feed 
the wererat any lie that led to power. And gifting 

101
Longtail a ring the imp claimed to find, the evil, 
greedy tendencies of the wererat amplified. He 
sought out the chapel, thinking it was his idea, 
and used rituals found in his stolen tome. Once 
he opened the gateway, Longtail realized what 
he’d done. With the lock removed, the pocket was 
opened. And many of Longtail’s army died.
Achsyyx’s plans fell together so perfectly that 
Longtail still hasn’t realized he’s been duped. He 
still believes the imp is a victim in this as well.
Although the chapel appears empty when the 
PCs arrive, it is not. An invisible Achsyyx keeps an 
eye out on the gateway at all times. And unless the 
PCs can go undetected, the imp notes the PCs’ 
presence. It may or may not empathically commu-
nicate this to Longtail (GM’s choice).
However, neither Longtail nor Achsyyx knows 
who the PCs are. Or why they are here. A few ad-
venturers have stumbled into the prison lately. The 
PCs could be anyone. This is especially problematic 
if the GM is not using the Longtail storyline provid-
ed at the front.
Note: It is possible the PCs have already encoun-
tered Longtail. If so, Achsyyx may not be here but 
has joined the fight in Room A101.
Roughly twice a day, the holy magic that once 
flooded the chapel returns for a moment. An illu-
sion of what the Room once looked like super-im-
poses upon the chapel, giving the impression the 
vortex is gone and all of the pews remain. This is 
temporary, however. The chapel always returns to 
this present state.
The gateway itself is an opaque, swirling, less 
powerful (but permanent) version of the gate spell. 
It is strictly a doorway that only allows travel be-
tween the extradimensional pocket and cannot 
be used to call forth specific creatures. It is up to 
the GM whether the gateway allows travel in both 
directions (thus allowing the PCs to go into it) or 
whether it only allows one-way travel (suggested). 
Once opened, the gateway remains open until 
closed. Since each group of PCs’ abilities and re-
sources are different, a number of ways to close the 
gateway are listed below.
 
A successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana or Reli-
gion) check by a divine or arcane spellcaster can 
be used to close the gate. Each successful check 
reduces the gateway by one quarter (meaning 
that it takes four successful checks to fully close 
the gateway). This closure restricts the size of 
creatures that can come through the gateway. 
At its current fully open state, a creature of up 
to Large size can come through. Each reduction 
diminishes the size of the creature that can come 
through by one size category so that if the gate 
is 1/4 closed, a Medium or smaller creature can 
come through. ½ closed allows a small or smaller 
creature to come through. 3/4 closed allows a Tiny 
or smaller creature to come through. This same 
process can also be used to reopen the gateway, 
setting up a potential duel of Religion/Arcana 
checks between Longtail and/or Achsyyx against 
the PCs.
 
A successful casting of a dispel magic spell, accom-
panied by a successful DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana 
or Religion) check, closes the gateway completely 
and permanently.
 
Using the ritual book for any of these activities 
provides advantage to die rolls but increases cast-
ing time to 10 or 15 minutes.
 
If the PCs have already found the book (in Room 
A104), they may have had time to study and read 
about the gateway/pocket. Grant them one ad-
vantage to any two rolls made in relation to the 
gateway, especially if they specifically address this 
action. 
 
The passage of a creature of the Prime Material 
plane through the gateway forces it shut (but the 
creature is trapped within the pocket). A fiendish 
rat will not work, but a regular rat would.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Achsyyx is a coward at heart but a thrall to the 
powers inside the pocket. He keeps the gate open, 
even if it costs his life (as he fears the final creature 
inside). It prefers to have Longtail do any dirty work 
but only summons his master if the PCs seem over-
ly interested in the gate.
PCs dragging their feet too long in this room 
watch as a pair of fiendish ax beaks stumble out 
of the gate.
If the PCs have figured out how to close the 
gateway and begin doing so before Longtail arrives, 
Achsyyx interferes. Staying invisible, then swoop-
ing in to use his stinger, and then turning invisible 
again is his favorite tactic. If he deems it advanta-
geous, he also uses suggestion to distract one of 

 102
the PCs. Achsyyx certainly relays the information to 
Longtail, who arrives in due course.
Once Longtail joins the battle (see Room A104), 
Achsyyx keeps itself out of danger, using his powers 
at a distance or not at all. He concentrates on keep-
ing the gateway open rather than helping Longtail. 
If given a choice between the gateway and his mas-
ter, Achsyyx chooses the gateway every time.
Once the gateway is closed, it disappears from 
view. Whether it is permanently destroyed or just 
hiding invisibly once again is up to the GM.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have two fiendish ax beaks already outside of the 
gate, with two more arriving a minute later. To 
decrease the challenge of this encounter, Achsyyx’s 
invisibility does not work until Longtail arrives.
A104 . LONGTAIL'S  
PRIVATE ROOM 
The door to this Room is open.
The far wall is smeared with tar or black ink. It 
is difficult to tell at this distance. A small bedroll, 
some caltrops, a backpack, and a continual flame 
candle holder are the only furnishings in this 
otherwise cheerless room.
After the PCs enter the Room, read the following:
On the floor, a few books lay scattered, as though 
someone was deep in reading while also angry. 
Some of the books are torn. One is bound in 
leather, and one has black paint smeared across the 
open pages. It looks as though someone was living 
here, but not anymore.
Note: It is possible to find Longtail here, but it is 
highly unlikely. He has since moved to Room A101 
and Room A102 since the owlbear (Room A100) 
appeared. He is holding up there behind a locked 
door. If the PCs deal with the owlbear and never go 
to Room A101, Longtail eventually makes his way 
back here.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This is Longtail’s Room. The wererat 
spends most of his time here after almost being 
killed by fiendish creatures that swarmed out of the 
gateway. Longtail is, unsurprisingly, unhappy about 
the turn of events and searches for a way to control 
the beasts coming through the gate. So far, he has 
not found anything.
There are six books altogether, in various con-
ditions. One is torn apart. One is covered in dark-
mantle ink. One is covered in maddening scribbles. 
One is a book on medicine and pain (well-worn and 
well-read). One is Longtail’s spellbook (worn), the 
spells listed in his stat block. Finally, one is the book 
of rituals stolen from the church in the preamble.
The last book may help them find a solution to 
dealing with the gateway, should they take time 
to read it thoroughly and/or ask the GM the right 
questions while studying it.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There is a continual flame candle holder, a 
pair of hardy, human-sized work boots laid next to 
the bedroll, along with a paring knife. A small stack 
of books, as well as the ritual tome, lie against his 
bedroll. He carries his personal magic items.

A105-A113 . LOST ROOMS 
Rooms 105 through 113 are a series of Rooms that 
can only be reached from the main area by using one 
of three secret doors. Due to this fact, these Rooms 
escaped the attention of all its inhabitants and re-
main much as the original builders left them.
Currently, most of the Rooms are empty, although 
several of them still bear magical remnants of their 
former occupants’ flights to freedom. PCs face little 
danger here as there are few live monsters, and any 
potential pitfalls are quite obvious, but some traps are 
difficult to avoid.
Random encounters cannot occur in this Section of 
Region A. Use logic when determining if a Room in 
this Section is safe to rest in.
A105 . FORGOTTEN ROOM 
The door to this Room is locked and trapped. It 
is very clearly a trap, as PCs can see the runes, 
glyphs, and sigils emblazoned all over the 
door. The trap is not subtle. 
The lock is a massive padlock with 
chains, clearly holding something 
inside. Several bolts and latches 
hold the door closed on this side. 
It looks ancient and undisturbed.
Should any PC touch the door 
before disarming the magical trap, the 
door releases 2d6 fire damage and 2d6 light-
ning damage throughout the entire L-shaped 
hallway outside the Room. Dexterity save for half 
damage (DC 14). Once triggered, the trap does reset 
in 24 hours.
Disarming the trap requires a dispel magic or sim-
ilar spell.
Unlocking the lock is a simple DC 16 Dexterity 
check (Thieves’ Tools). If the check fails by more than 
5 (11 or less), the original trap is triggered (again), 
even if it has not reset yet. Opening the lock and un-
doing the latches takes time and makes noise. There 
is no way to surprise the occupants.
The demons, however, have still been unable to 
escape the Room. Seems unnecessary when phrased 
like this because, obviously, they are there. Despite 
escaping from the glass cube, the demons have been 
unable to bypass the cell’s other defensive measures 
until now.
Note: This is a complicated encounter. The inhabi-
tants cannot escape from the inside, but once the PCs 
open the 
door, 
they 
can mount an escape. 

 104
Read the following text once the door is opened.
As the door opens, the presence of evil is over-
whelming. A harsh red light seems to come from 
nowhere, bathing the room in vaguely evil shad-
ows. Heat clings to your exposed skin, and an acrid 
smell assaults your nostrils. 
The ceiling is extremely tall, and the floor is covered 
in broken glass. Three demonic beasts lurch around 
the room, pacing impatiently. They puff their chests 
and turn to face you as the door opens.
If you believe there is time for the PCs to notice, read 
the following text.
The hunched skeleton of something improbably 
large rests on a heavy stool against a stove furnace 
contraption at the corner. On the top of the stove 
are two short glass jars. One appears to hold 
something obscured and blurry. The other is filled 
with roiling blood.
Initial Attitude: Hostile 
Encounter: This Room was once a prison cell for 
powerful demons, who still remain. But its purpose 
was long forgotten, even before the earthquakes. Its 
inhabitants have had a long time to foment hatred 
and plan their escape. They have no idea what exists 
beyond the door but still intend to escape, giv-
en a chance.
The heat is not hot enough to cause damage, 
but it is uncomfortable and results in exhaustion 
(level 1) at the end of round 4 of combat, which 
becomes exhaustion (level 2) after the fight is over.
Three dretches have been held captive here for 
centuries alongside a quasit (disguised as a bat 
hanging from the ceiling). There are also two jars 
holding two distinct creatures. See below. Everyone 
was once held inside a glass cube, but it has since 
broken open. The demons, however, have still been 
unable to escape the Room.
One of the dretches holds a unicorn horn in 
its hand. The other has a femur from a creature 
the PCs have never seen before. The last wears a 
brass collar.
If the unicorn horn breaks, the spell wither, 
and bloom is triggered, affecting everyone in the 
Room. The dretch knows this and may attempt to 
break it as a tactic. This requires a DC 18 Strength 
check, however.
The brass collar once had a hold monster spell 
placed on it. The magic has since faded. But some-
times, the collar shocks the dretch per the shocking 
grasp spell. See tactics.
The large skeleton is the remains of a guardian 
that died centuries ago. The original prison guards 
simply forgot about him, and the evil in this Room 
made the flesh wither off its body.
One of the jars contains a tiny but powerful de-
mon. The second jar contains sentient, evil blood. 
The demon can animate the skeleton and use it to 
get around, but is presently on top of the stove as 
a vantage point to survey the Room. The sentient 
blood (Gligg) is a complicated foe.
Both jars are indestructible while in this prison 
Room. Should the bottle demon in the first jar be 
carried out of the Room, it attempts to break itself 
out. The jar is still extremely resilient (AC20, 20 hp), 
and the demon, being unable to generate any mo-
mentum given that it fully occupying the jar, makes 
all its attacks at disadvantage. Nevertheless, if the 
characters simply stick the jar in a rucksack and 
forget about it, the GM should roll an attack every 
minute or so. It’s a great way to terrify the players 
at the table, and, should the demon break out, it 
might make the next stop for a short or long rest 
very entertaining. 
Gligg is another matter altogether. Even among 
the demons in this Room, Gligg is hated. It is an 
anomaly in the dungeon and in the fabric of reality 
itself, and its presence is a mystery. Where it came 
from and why it is imprisoned with demons is 
utterly obscure. A DC14 Wisdom (Insight) check re-
veals to the characters Gligg was kept here because 
it couldn’t otherwise be kept or destroyed. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The fight starts almost instantly. The pair of 
dretches have already released their fetid clouds, so 
the PCs must make saving throws as soon as the 
door opens.
The dretches roll initiative together. Everyone 
else rolls their own initiative. Gligg goes on a ‘1.’
On the first round, the dretches use the weap-
ons in their hands on the first round, bashing and 
stabbing with rage. They gain advantage on this 
opening attack and deal an additional +2 damage 
should they successfully hit. Meanwhile, while 

105
disguised as a bat, the quasit uses its scare ability 
on the first PC through the door.
With their actions in the second round, the 
dretches dogpile on a single opponent, using their 
multi-attack to subdue an enemy quickly. They push 
back the PCs if possible. They regenerate three hit 
points each if they have suffered any damage.
The quasit, however, goes invisible and does not 
become visible again. Instead, it waits for an op-
portunity to fly out of the Room and escape. If you 
handle the encounter properly, the PCs may have 
never noticed the quasit (bat).
At the start of round three, the large skeleton 
resting against the furnace animates and grabs 
the bottle demon jar from the top of the stove 
while simultaneously grabbing the stool to use as a 
bashing weapon. The dretches regenerate three hit 
points each if they are still alive. If the third dretch 
is still up, the shocking grasp spell triggers on its 
collar, dealing 3 points of damage. Gligg casts dark-
ness into the eyes of one of the PCs.
During round four, the skeleton faces off against 
the closest PC while the bottle demon casts death 
ward on the skeleton. If any of the dretches are still 
up, they flank (if possible) and continue attacking. 
Gligg casts guidence on the skeleton.
At the top of round five, the bottle demon casts 
haste on the skeleton and then magic missile on all 
subsequent rounds. Unless a PC gets within 5 feet 
of it, in which case the bottle demon uses its bottle 
throw ability. The skeleton pushes forward if it can. 
Gligg casts slow on the nearest PC.
After that, the fight continues normally if anyone 
is left standing. The bottle demon can cast magic 
missile two more times.
The skeleton is too large to get through the 
doorway. But its objective is to get the jar out of the 
Room. As soon as it can get to the doorway, or as 
close as possible, it tosses the jar over the heads of 
the PCs. From there, the invisible quasit can grab 
the jar and fly away (as a bat). The quasit remains 
invisible when it picks up the jar.
If the bottle demon gets out of the Room, Gligg 
turns on its cohorts, casting confusion and sleep on 
everyone (on alternating rounds).
It is possible, the PCs will try to draw the fight 
out of the Room. This is perfectly fine. The skeleton 
has no need/desire to escape, but the others do. 
If the PCs give the demons space to operate, the 
dretches work to get the bottle demon out (know-
ing it will come back from them, eventually).
Note: While in this Room, all of the enemies 
gain advantage on resistance rolls of any kind 
(saves, etc.). They have been here a long time. Their 
will is strong. Whatever good energy existed here 
has turned villainous.
After the fight is over, read the following.
The heat is unbearable. You take a moment to 
gather your senses and sit. Your shoulders ache, 
and your mind is overcome with thoughts of 
villainy. This room is evil. While there is probably 
much to explore here, the oppressiveness of the 
room is noticeable. Long breath. But there’s anoth-
er problem before you. What to do with this jar?
The bottle demon may or may not still be alive 
after the fight. If it died in the fight, so be it. There 
is nothing for the GM to track. However, if the 
bottle demon does survive, the PCs have a choice 
to make. Do they put it back in the Room or take it 
with them? The situation with Gligg is similar...
Gligg cannot be destroyed, but it can be rea-
soned with. It has no voice but communicates in 
Abyssal through telepathy. It can also speak its na-
tive tongue, which is some ancient language from 
before elves and giants. GMs are encouraged to 
make it something weird. Maybe Gligg is a primor-
dial githyanki. Gligg might learn common slowly, 
through association with the PCs.
Gligg is very intelligent but might pretend to 
be stupid while discerning who these adventurers 
are. It might help the PCs with its limited powers. 
If so, someone must carry the jar. It is beyond evil, 
so just holding it will, over time, corrupt the PC. 
Even if the PCs trade off duties, Gligg’s evil will 
slowly affect them all. It might also read the minds 
of the PCs and, slowly over time, feed their wants 
and needs, making things happen in one charac-
ter’s favor over the others. Turning people against 
one another is what he does best. Give Gligg any 
high-level enchantment spells you want it to have.
But his powers can prove useful. The GM is 
encouraged to mix up what Gligg can do from time 
to time. The PCs can’t see? Gligg casts continual 
flame on someone’s clothing. The PCs are being 
overwhelmed? Gligg casts mage armor and shield on 

 106
the person holding the jar. The first time he casts 
magic missile, only one comes out. The second time, 
maybe three. Gligg will certainly tempt the PCs to 
use his power more and more until he turns the 
power off at the worst moment.
The PCs will probably try to drink Gligg. Some 
of him, at least. He does not come apart that way. 
He is a near-solid and cannot be cut. Therefore, 
if consumed, Gligg can be a powerful poison or a 
strong elixir. Inside someone’s body, it is even more 
powerful. The jar no longer holds it and being eter-
nal, Gligg can just wait out the PC who drank it.
Alternatively, the PCs can just leave the jars here 
and lock the door on their way out.
If the quasit escapes, it makes its way through 
the dungeon invisibly, as best as it can. It will even-
tually find someone to ally with and help them re-
sist and/or escape. Because of the location of Room 
A105, it can either head to Region B (if the doors 
are open) or north to link up with surviving human-
oids. This is left open for the GM to coordinate.
Treasure: The skeleton wears a golden necklace with a 
thick chain and an amulet with a holy symbol on it, 
now tarnished and brown. The edges are rusted. It 
radiates powerful evil and abjuration magic. Treat 
it as +1 resistance, should a PC wear it, but the evil 
cannot be easily removed from the item. This may 
eventually lead to a curse and could be a future 
quest, should the PCs survive.
The shattered glass covering the floor can be 
used as a magical component in any kind of ban-
ishment or binding spell. It replaces the standard 
material components of that spell. The PCs can 
collect roughly two dozen ‘doses’ of the glass if they 
spend an hour gathering the glass into a container.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two more dretches. To decrease the challenge 
of the encounter, the skeleton animates starting 
on Round 4.
A106 . THUNDER CELL 
Drawn on the door to this Room is the Celestial rune 
for ‘thunder.’ A DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check is 
required to translate the rune. The door to this Room 
is locked, requiring a DC 18 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) 
check or an arcane spellcaster to touch the door with 
a lightning-based or wind-based spell. 
A blast of air expels from the room with force as 
the door opens, pushing you to the ground. The 
room contains a strange, elongated desk There is 
also a large bronze plate in the center of the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The rune on the floor is the same as the 
one on the door. If any lawful or good PC stands on 
the plate, thunder and a blast of air erupts from the 
floor (for 1 full minute), but it does not hurt. In-
stead, it cleanses the PC of all poisons, ability score 
damage, and heals 3d8+3 points of damage.
In addition, so long as the PC is lawful good 
character remains on the plate for the full min-
ute, he gains temporary (1d20 days) resistance to 
fire damage. 
If a chaotic or evil PC stands on the plate, he 
suffers 3d8+3 electrical damage and gains one level 
of exhaustion. If a PC is both chaotic AND evil, he 
suffers this damage twice. This is pure arcane elec-
tricity that bypasses electricity resistance but not 
spell resistance.
Chaotic good and lawful evil characters gain/lose 
nothing from this thunder. 
Encounter Condition: Fear 14, Hallowed 2, Safe
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Inside the desk are numerous drawers, 
doors, and cubby holes. The GM is encouraged to 
make the process of opening and sliding doors 
complicated, like an intricate puzzle box. This 
drawer slides open, and a button is revealed, which 
makes a previously locked drawer openable. You 
get the idea.
Five scrolls (all penned in different hands) are 
tucked away in different places. Each is written in 
a different language, giving wizards a project to 
decipher them all.
The scrolls contain the following spells:
 
magic weapon and nondetection
 
protection from good and evil, silence, and hold 
person
 
disguise self and phantom steed
 
protection from energy, invisibility, and levitate
 
shield and spider climb

Clerics may attempt to absolve the sinners. This 
may require the expenditure of a spell, a turning 
undead, or perhaps hit points. GMs are encour-
aged to make the cost match the story so far or the 
crimes committed by the individuals depicted in 
the statues.
Encounter Condition: Fog 5, Poor Footing 2
Tactics: Do not immediately tell the PC they have lost 
Charisma and gained Intelligence. Instead, wait 
until after their next long rest.

two rounds.
A107 . HOLDING PENS 
Small cells, barely large enough to fit a person 
comfortably, line the length of this room. Empty 
shackles hang from the wall, magically electrical 
energy crackling from them.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This Room was once used to hold smaller 
and less troublesome demons and devils. Usually, 
demons and devils were forced to face each other, 
knowing their ideological differences would drive 
the two mad and make escape attempts less likely–
and if the creatures did manage to get free, they’d 
be more inclined to kill one another than break 
out of the prison. The shackles act as dimensional 
shackles with hold monster (DC 18) cast on them. 
Encounter Condition: Haunted, Negative 
Energy, Safe
Tactics: If the PCs want to remove the shackles from 
the wall, they must first succeed at a DC 18 Wisdom 
saving throw or be held per hold monster. Then, 
they must succeed at a DC 22 Strength (Athletics) 
check. If both are successful, one pair of shackles is 
ripped from the wall. Spell resistance does not work 
against these shackles.
PCs that remain in this Room for too long begin 
to feel the unnerving energy of the demons who 
spent centuries here. Their aura has permeated the 
rock and made the Room unlivable. PCs wishing 
to rest here get no sleep but avoid the rigors of 
the dungeon.
PCs that attempt to rest here are overcome with 
nightmarish visions of demon creatures being 
shackled and caged, tearing their own limbs off, 
or growing new mouths in order to bite out their 
own throats. Upon waking, characters suffer 1d4 
Wisdom damage and exhaustion (level 1) instead of 
gaining the benefit of rest. They also begin to sweat 
blood for the next 24 hours, making any interper-
sonal checks at disadvantage as a result. 
Feel free to describe the nightmares how-
ever you wish. Throw in some sweating blood, 
and so on.
Treasure: N/A

A108 . COLD CELL 
Drawn on the door to this Room is the Celestial rune 
for ‘water.’ A DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check is 
required to translate the rune. The door to this Room 
is locked, requiring a DC 18 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) 
check or an arcane spellcaster to touch the door with 
a cold-based spell. 
A blast of cold air expels from the room as the door 
opens. The floor, recessed, holds water about 4 or 5 
feet deep. Ice has formed along the walls, and mist 
hangs just over the lip of the water.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The rune on the floor is the same as the 
one on the door. If any lawful or good PC stands on 
the plate, cold and ice erupts from the floor (for 1 
full minute), but it does not hurt. Instead, it cleans-
es the PC of all poisons, ability score damage, and 
heals 3d8+3 points of damage.
In addition, so long as the PC is lawful good and 
remains on the plate for the full minute, he gains 
temporary (1d20 days) resistance to cold damage. 
If a chaotic or evil PC stands on the plate, he 
suffers 3d8+3 electrical damage and gains one 
level of exhaustion. If a PC is both chaotic AND evil, 

 108
he suffers this damage twice. This is pure arcane 
cold that bypasses cold resistance but not spell 
resistance.
Chaotic good and lawful evil characters gain/lose 
nothing from this cold. 
Encounter Condition: Extreme Cold, Flooded
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs search the water, allow a DC 15 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to find pipes of 
haunting that have become waterlogged. Three 
castings of mending restore the pipes.
A109 . FOGGY ROOM 
A thick ankle-high gray fog covers the entire 
floor. Occasional bright flashes within the fog are 
followed by a crackling sound. Stone statues, three 
in all, stand at the corners, billowing fog from 
their agape mouths. The statues are unique, even 
in size, pose, and gender. Their faces permanently 
are etched in horror. A strange gurgling noise 
fills the air.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This fog is the result of magical, gurgling 
energies released from the broken mouths of three 
stoney victims, placed here and punished by the 
guardians. All of the statues were once evil humans 
from an ancient empire, now turned to stone. These 
three were cruel kings and queens, punished for 
their sins centuries ago.
 
King Huthor, who slew 1,000 of his own people 
as a display of his power. He is in the NW corner, 
facing the center of the room.
 
Queen Osilith who encouraged her king husband 
to do it. She is in the NE corner, her head twisted 
to face south.
 
Prince Ferric, ‘the Debauched,’ a scion of an 
ancient and now forgotten house who spent his 
entire fortune in the pursuit of ever greater highs, 
eventually beginning to poison the food and wa-
ter supplies of his people for the thrill of watching 
them sicken and die, never understanding why. 
He is in the Southwest corner. His body points 
toward the center of the room, but his head is 
twisted completely around, facing the corner.
The PCs may not see it from across the room, 
but scores of fiendish beetles pour from the eyes of 
the statues. When they fall into the fog, they scream 
in agony as they die and dissipate into more fog. It 
is an unending cycle.
The hands of the statues face outward or are 
upturned in unique poses. Etched into the stone 
of each statue are lash marks as though they had 
been whipped.
The fog covers the entire floor of the Room ex-
cept for the first square to the west of the doorway. 
The fog is perfectly stationary and does not spill out 
into the hallway. 
The bright flashes and crackling are the result of 
the electrical charge that the fog bears (if the GM 
wants to make it more obvious, have occasional 
arcs of electricity race across the top of the fog). Any 
creature moving through the fog takes 1 point of 
damage per round due to the electrical discharges 
(2 points of damage per round if wearing metal 
armor or otherwise carrying a lot of metal).
Those who cross the Room to examine the 
statues suffer damage along the way. There is 
nothing to be discerned by looking at them. They 
are ancient, elusive figures from a kingdom the PCs 
have never heard of. Touching a statue’s hand(s) is 
another story.
Each one imparts a story. The PC’s mind is 
flooded with images of past trauma, torture, and 
blood — both by the sinners and their victims. 
These three were certainly punished for their trans-
gressions. Once a hand is touched, it cannot be let 
go of for a full minute, as the pain transfers from 
the statue to the PC.  The damage, however, takes 
the form of knowledge.
Once the full minute is over, during which time 
the PC does not suffer electrical damage, the PC 
gains 1 point of Intelligence but loses one point of 
Charisma. Seeing this horror imparts knowledge 
but strains empathy. The PC is also exhausted (level 
2) by this experience.
Each PC can touch only one statue but may not want 
to after they see what it has done to another PC.
Tactics: Do not immediately tell the PC they have lost 
Charisma and gained Intelligence. Instead, wait 
until after their next long rest.
Clerics may attempt to absolve the sinners. 
This may require the expenditure of a spell, an 

109
appropriate channel divinity, or perhaps hit points. 
GMs are encouraged to make the cost match the 
story so far or the crimes committed by the individ-
uals depicted in the statues.
Encounter Condition: Fog 5, Poor Footing 2
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the fog by 1. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the damage of the fog to 1 or 2 
damage per two rounds.
A110 . FLOATING SPHERES
The southern door to this Room is locked, requiring a 
DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to open.
Dozens of fist-sized spheres of swirling color float 
gently within the room as if moved by an un-
felt breeze.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The spheres are actually the physical 
embodiment of a gateway akin to the one found in 
Room A103, formed over time as the wards be-
gan to fail.
The moment a living creature enters the Room, 
the colorful spheres begin to float toward the center 
of the Room. There, they combine with each other 
and make a larger sphere. It takes four rounds 
for the spheres to completely form together and 
create an open gateway with the same properties 
(including a means to shut it down) as the one 
in Room A103. On the fifth round, something 
comes through (a fiendish owlbear is suggested, 
but it could be a number of fiendish darkmantles, 
fiendish stirges, fiendish dire rats, or fiendish rat 
swarms; the decision is up to the GM).
The gateway requires the presence of a living 
creature to open completely, and if the PCs leave 
the Room before the gateway can fully form, then 
the spheres break apart and continue floating. Once 
opened, however, the gateway remains open until 
closed by the same method that can close the one 
in Room A103.
The moment a living creature enters the Room, 
the colorful spheres begin to float toward the center 
of the Room. There, they combine with each other 
and make a larger sphere. It takes four rounds 
for the spheres to completely form together and 
create an open gateway with the same properties 
(including a means to shut it down) as the one in 
Room A103. On the fifth round, something comes 
through. This pattern continues, with a new fiend-
ish creature emerging every five rounds. Roll on 
the following table to determine what steps from 
the portal.
D6eMergent creature
11d3 fiendish ax beaks
2Two fiendish giant bats
3One or two fiendish panthers
41d3+2 howling, fiendish wolves
5One or two fiendish wild boars
6
Roll again. If a six is rolled again, a fiendish 
owlbear, eyes gleaming red, feathers 
glinting black and silver, emerges from the 
gateway; otherwise, two fiendish snake 
swarms emerge
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
the spheres open the portal after only 3 rounds and 
continue forming regardless of whether the PCs 
remain in the Room or not; if the PCs leave before 
the gate is fully opened, it still opens, and the beast 
or beasts emerge and hunt the PCs. To decrease 
the challenge of this encounter, have the gateway 
disgorge only a single beast before the spheres of 
the gateway drift apart again. 
Scaling: N/A
A111 . TWO PILLARS
Two segmented, nondescript square pillars domi-
nate the area. Large blades jut from the pillars into 
the space between. Pieces of a thin, broken skeleton 
lie near the eastern one.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The skeleton has been cut into segments 
and is beyond identification. It is shorter and 
thinner than the average human, should the PCs 
investigate the remains. The skeleton belongs to 

 110
an unfortunate drow who was killed by the trap. In 
turn, the trap has failed to reset.
However, the left hand of the drow is intact. 
Whenever a PC steps on the stone floor, the fig-
ures of the hand move as though playing a lyre. 
Each step taken by the PCs is mirrored by a finger 
motion. A DC14 Intelligence (History) check allows 
a character to identify the tune as that of an old 
children’s song (nursery rhyme if your game world 
has those). Bards gain advantage on this check. 
PCs may realize the hand is magical or holds 
some value. If they don’t break or destroy it, some-
one may carry the hand in a sack, or a necklace, 
or wherever. So long as someone is in possession 
of the hand, it grants a +2 bonus to magic-based 
saving throws. But the hand will forever twitch and 
move. It is not strong and cannot hurt anyone, but 
it never stops moving. 
Each pillar reaches to the ceiling, and the 
segments are a foot apart and so, in turn, are the 
blades. Each side of the column has a full set of 
blades, so the only way past the blades is to squeeze 
between them or to try and clear a space by push-
ing the blades back into the spaces. The blades are 
not as sharp as they used to be and are a bit rusty, 
but gloves are recommended for this task.
Because of the mechanism of the trap, all of 
the blades move together. It is impossible to push 
only one blade at a time back into the column. 
A DC 20 Strength check is required to give 
enough force on a single blade to rearm the 
entire mechanism and bring all the blades 
back into their column. For each additional 
blade that has force applied to it, the Strength 
check is reduced by 2; up to four creatures can 
push on the blades at one time (one blade per 
column side).
Each creature must succeed at the appropriate 
Strength check to do their part, so if four are push-
ing, each must succeed at a DC 12 Strength check 
for the blades to be reset. Once reset, the trap can-
not be sprung again because its triggering mech-
anism (DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check) is 
broken. The characters could mend it with a DC14 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, in which case any 
creature triggering the trap suffers 4d8 slashing 
damage if they step between the pillars, depressing 
the pressure pad.
Encounter Condition: Spell Resistance
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: An inspection of the bones, now scattered 
in dangerous parts of the Room, reveals a bracelet 
next to what might be an arm bone. The bracelet 
is old, scuffed, and now dented. It may, however, 
still possess magic. A simple cantrip, like mending, 
restores this bracelet to its original power, which 
keeps the wearer warm while he sleeps.

A112 . GATEWAY TO FIRE 
Drawn on the eastern door to this Room is a Celestial 
rune. A DC 20 Arcana check by a lawful character (or 
those who speak celestial) is required to translate the 
rune. “Purge thy body and thoughts with holy flame.”
The door is not locked, but it is difficult to open. In-
side the door, piles of wood and furniture have been 
stacked up to prevent entry, but a DC 15 Strength 
check opens it. Some light can be seen from under 
the door crack.
The door on the north-
ern wall is locked 
on both sides, 
requiring a 
DC 18 

111
Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to open. Alternatively, 
an arcane spellcaster may open the door by casting a 
single fire-based spell. The spell does no damage; the 
door absorbs it all.
A blast of hot air expels from the room as the door 
opens. An unnatural light bathes the area. A small 
rune is written on a bronze plate in the center of 
the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The rune on the floor is the same as the 
one on the door. If any lawful or good PC stands on 
the plate, a gout of fire erupts from the floor (for 1 
full minute), but it does not burn. Instead, it cleans-
es the PC of all poisons, ability score damage, and 
heals 3d8+3 points of damage.
In addition, so long as the PC is lawful good and 
remains on the plate for the full minute, he gains 
temporary (1d20 days) resistance to fire damage. 
If a chaotic or evil PC stands on the plate, he 
suffers 3d8+3 fire damage and gains one level of 
exhaustion. If a PC is both chaotic AND evil, he suf-
fers this damage twice. This is pure arcane fire that 
bypasses fire resistance but not spell resistance.
Chaotic good and lawful evil characters gain/lose 
nothing from these fires.

A113 . PRISON VAULT ANTECHAM-
BER
All of the doors to this Room are locked from the 
inside. The doors to this Room require a DC 18 
Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to unlock or a DC 20 
Strength check to bash open.
This hallway seems to loop back on itself, leading 
to nowhere. Two doors in the south and one in the 
north are the only features here.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The hallway surrounds a prison vault 
(Room A114) that once held a number of middling 
fiends. The block exhibits no cracks, pores, or pit-
ting and is simply one piece of dark basalt. On the 
floor on the west side is a bronze plate cut into the 
shape of a crescent moon. The PCs may not imme-
diately notice it. GMs should decide if they can find 
it or just accidentally step on it.
The plate is a permanent, invisible dimension 
door that instantly transports anyone standing on 
it to Room A114. To his companions, the PC seems 
to have disappeared suddenly. The effect can be 
detected with detect magic, revealing an aura of 
moderate conjuration magic all about the floor.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: N/A 
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: To decrease the challenge of this encounter, 
the bronze plate only affects non-lawful or non-
good characters. Or both.

Gligg is anything the GM wants it to

Whatever that was.

The same can be done from Room A114, but that 
assumes that one understands the process.
The dimension door effect can transport any 
creature from Room A113 to Room A114 and 
vice-versa, provided that the creature, once trans-
ported, steps back out of the space before stepping 
back in. That is, the moment a creature steps onto 
the dimension door in the hallway, they are trans-
ported to the bronze plate inside the vault. They 
cannot make use of the vault’s dimension door ef-
fect until they step out of the dimension door space 
and then step back in.
This should not really be a challenge for PCs as 
long as they do what comes naturally: explore their 
surroundings. As long as they inspect the walls 
or otherwise move off the dimension door space, 
they are free to use it again. But until they do, they 
are trapped. 
The inside of the vault is airtight, a fact that was 
not a problem for the extraplanar fiends it held, but 
is a problem for any PCs trapped in here. There is 
enough air for one Medium creature for 12 rounds.
Reduce the air supply appropriately for every 
additional creature (by one-half if another Medium 
creature is there, by one-quarter if a Small creature 
is there, and so on). Although the PCs should have 
no trouble finding their way back to Room A113, it 
is possible that they could die.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Dead orcs litter the floor. A DC 10 Inves-
tigation check reveals three silver daggers hidden 
among their gear. The orcs didn’t need Longtail 
knowing they had a backup plan.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
reduce the amount of air in the Room to 9 rounds. 
To decrease the challenge, allow the PCs to return 
to Room A113 1d3 rounds later if they don’t step off 
the bronze plate.
A115 . VAULT 
The door to this Room is open.
The floor of this room is a mess. Dozens of broken 
crates and busted barrels, their contents spilled 
on the floor, mixed with the moldy remnants of 
at least as many sacks to completely cover the 
floor. A blackened scorch mark in the middle of the 
room indicates a magical fire from a central point. 
The lingering smell of fire and mold hangs in the 
air, though it is unclear how long ago all of this 
destruction happened.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: This vault served as a major storage area 
but like almost everything else in this portion of 
the dungeon, was abandoned. The destruction was 
caused by orcs, but it is unclear (upon inspection) if 
the damage was intentional or not. 
Whether by accident or by madness, an orc got 
a hold of a magical staff, and it exploded on him, 
killing him and another orc. They were incinerated 
by the magical fire, which also consumed the staff 
and all the moldy bags in the room.
From time to time, the voices of the dead orcs 
can be heard moaning and wailing through the 
cracks in the walls. Their ghosts lack the power to 
do anything, but their pain lingers through un-
easy sounds.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: If the PCs lock the door with a DC 13 Dexter-
ity (Thieves’ Tools) check, the Room is considered 
Safe, though smelly.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: N/A
A116 . NOISE
Unless the PCs have already dealt with the fiendish 
owlbear in Room A100, read the following.
Horrid shrieking echoes from the hallway to the 
north, followed by another awful sound like ani-
mals being ripped apart.
Initial Attitude: N/A 
Encounter: The rampaging owlbear in Room A100 is 
fighting and killing fiendish darkmantles. The PCs 

113
may recognize the noise from the darkmantles, but 
not the owlbears.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs do nothing, the owlbear will finish 
off the darkmantles in due course and perhaps start 
searching in this direction after 10 or 15 minutes.
Note: If the owlbear has been dealt with, or the PCs 
need some action, this is a good place for a random 
encounter coming from both the south and west.
Treasure: N/A 
Scaling: N/A
AFTERMATH OF REGION A
There are possibly many loose plot threads to this 
Region, should the PCs not deal with everything here.
 
If Orghar is not killed, his villainy spreads to 
Region B. He may or may not take more orcs 
and kobolds with him. They also may 
end up killing each other, leaving 
Orghar all alone in his quest to 
escape.
 
If the troglodytes are left alone, 
their wounded heal, and the 
group travels north to search for an 
escape. This probably ends in more 
deaths, but that’s the GM’s decision.
 
If Longtail and/or Achsyyx are not 
killed, they look for a way out. 
Achsyyx pretends he has no idea 
this would happen and returns 
to loyally serving Longtail. Do 
they trail the PCs or venture out 
on their own?
 
The chapel gateway has a 
limited number of prisoners 
inside it. Eventually, a few more 
owlbears escape and go looking 
for something to eat. 
 
Gligg and the bottle demon 
pose significant issues as well. 
Not to mention the quasits. If 
any escaped Room A105, they are 
free to roam Region A and then 
B or E. The long-term conse-
quences may be too much for the 
guardians of E who already struggle to reclaim 
the Region.
 
Let us not forget that there are two adventurers 
in Region A who might join the PCs or encounter 
them again. Do not overlook their use.
 
Or the lizardfolk. GMs have their hands full...
