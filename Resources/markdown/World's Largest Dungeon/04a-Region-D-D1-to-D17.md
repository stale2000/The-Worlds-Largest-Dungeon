# Region D: The Tartarean Depths of the Xill Master

## Overview

Chtrax is a diabolic xill of such caliber that his society willingly cast him out to wander the planes for the remainder of eternity. Desperately seeking revenge, the xill searched for a good way to destroy his people outright. During his roamings, he came upon information which confirmed the existence of a malevolent, exiled god, Asrakhor the Undying, a terrible threat to the stability of the planes if freed. He understood from the depths of his madness that Asrakhor could help him get his revenge, but he did not know where to find him. All his searching yielded no clues, no evidence, nothing concrete enough to substantiate its existence.

The only way to reach this god, Chtrax realized, was through the mighty power of a wish spell. Moreover, the xill knew where he could find one at minimal cost. Aware of the world's largest dungeon, and its original purpose, he suspected the devil's vault still contained a powerful pit fiend named Kator. If Chtrax could see this beast, he was certain he could gain the wish. A mad plan to be certain, Chtrax has been especially careful not to reveal the truth behind his goals, for he knows breaching the walls of the vault would surely result in the deaths of all his servants.

The wicked xill traveled a myriad of Material Planes, but for all his searching, he could not locate the place, though many had heard of it, and several dusty tomes spoke eloquently of it. In frustration, he tortured and maimed many a sage and scholar in his efforts to locate the massive complex. Finally, one brutalized soul gave him a name – Allmnan. Even Chtrax had heard of this ancient lore master, but he had believed, like most beings in the planes, the old man to be dead. He quickly tracked down the sage, finding him deep within the Astral Plane. After torturing the old man for two years, the sage finally revealed the location of the dungeon. Not trusting the information, Chtrax took the crippled scholar with him. When they finally reached the sprawling complex, he killed the old man and left his bones to rot on the surface, before descending into the dungeon's tunnels.

Unable to locate the vault on his own, he suspected it remained concealed and intact. He also realized he could never hope to uncover the vault on his own, as the labor would be too overwhelming for just one creature, so he turned to the derro for assistance. In their warrens, they had uncovered extensive veins of truesilver, a substance especially useful for controlling and containing devils, and deposits of adamantine – two things Chtrax knew the celestials used to create the vault holding the fiends. With the recent geological instability, more and more clues revealed themselves to the malicious, self-serving xill, turning suspicion into solid evidence.

Before the inevitable assumption of control over the mad derro, Chtrax approached a trapped formian queen. Weakened and injured from a costly war with the derro, and desperate to be back in touch with the hive on her native plane, the xill's honeyed words swayed her, and she agreed to transfer control over her most trusted myrmarchs in exchange for her freedom. The xill lied, of course, and murdered her in the shadows of an obscure cave with her eggs all around her, stealing her essence and trapping it in a special phylactery.

### Command Structure

Considering the unusual nature of the region, Chtrax organized his minions with brutal efficiency. He commands the entire operation, answering to none. Serving him are three formian myrmarchs, each with specific duties. The only resistance to his authority comes from a rebel derro, the savant Souiji.

The first myrmarch oversees security of the mining outfit and truesilver extraction in the Great Hall. Chtrax, not content with the truesilver extracted by the other myrmarch's crews, started drilling into the Great Hall for more truesilver, entrusting this operation to the first myrmarch, in addition to his responsibilities for security. In fact, the Great Hall has transformed from this region's central nervous system to a massive drill, refinement and transportation site. Hence, security is thinner there than it was, just a few short weeks ago. He also procures stone golems from the gnome, positioning the golems at checkpoints throughout the complex, and maintaining existing ones. Finally, he has a squad of formian warriors serving him, some of whom ride gorgons. These guards oversee extraction caverns, patrol the tunnels, and ensure traps and sentry towers are in working order.

The second myrmarch controls the security and excavation of the northern mines. With the recent waves of plague and rogue xill ambushes, the place has collapsed into chaos. Furthermore, the myrmarch here does not trust the xill master, and bides his time, waiting for proof of his suspicions to surface. Most of the remaining labor there works to build a giant bore to expedite mining.

The last myrmarch oversees excavation. A typical extraction crew consists of a taskmaster, derro leaders, a lesser savant, three handler crew and three teams. Each group of handlers control one of the following: bulette, destrachan or yrthak. Each monster digging team crushes the rocks, and the teams are responsible for removing the rubble. Two teams are composed of a grimlock foreman and duergar slaves, who clear away much of the debris created by the handler crews. The third team consist of a grimlock foreman and deep dwarf sounders. This crew uses a magic device created by the evil gnome to test the depth of the rock, search for dead caves, and material compositional changes. Their efforts are hazardous and futile; it's dangerous to use the device because it occasionally unleashes crackling electricity, almost always vaporizing a slave or two; it is futile because the device only has an accurate range of about 5 to 10 ft. due to the vault's inherent warping nature.

Fortunately, the recent collapses and instability of their excavations severely reduced the derro's command structure, allowing Chtrax to easily ingratiate himself, slipping past the paranoia and the xenophobia that describes the psychology of this degenerate race. He rose quickly through the ranks to become the trusted advisor to the only remaining high savant, eventually supplanting the leader and taking control of the entire region.

Chtrax amassed a large excavation force. The derro captured duergar and deep dwarves to serve as slaves. A legion of destrachan and several yrthak act as living tools to wear away the rock with their sonic attacks, while the formians offer security and additional labor for digging. The derro high savant tenuously controls a tarrasque, urging it to break through the bands of adamantine warding the vault. Chtrax has also gained the help from Korus, a particularly evil gnome who, though cruel enough to appreciate Chtrax's plan, is not worthy in the xill's eyes to be in possession of such guarded information. The gnome produces the wailing guardians, stone golems capable of creating a terrific noise, regular stone golems, tools to handle the truesilver, and all manner of other mining equipment. Finally, Chtrax secretly injects eggs into the derro and slaves to replace his flawed subjects with reliable xill.

The warping effects of the vault impede divination spells, and even go so far as to disrupt magnetic impulses rendering mechanical direction sense useless and confusing those with a propensity for navigation. For these reasons, Chtrax commands the workers to tunnel through the whole place. He knows the vault is close, but exactly where, he cannot say. The desperate digging undermines the entire complex, destabilizing it. Earthquakes ripple through the place, along with the aftershocks, collapsing tunnels and killing more slaves and servants daily. Each collapse sets back the operation, as Chtrax must commit labor to building and rebuilding retaining walls to allow the excavation to continue. Despite the losses, Chtrax is committed to uncovering the vault, capturing the pit fiend and discovering for himself where the dark god lies.

---

## Hive Mind

Formians normally share a collective consciousness when within 50 miles of the formian queen, allowing them to react to danger as if they all faced it simultaneously. Chtrax realized if he killed the formian queen, the formians would be useless to him and they would be aware of their queen's death. To galvanize his command over these outsiders, Chtrax trapped her essence in special phylactery, which allows the formians to communicate through the myrmarchs, but only to the extent of their respective sections. Though the hive mind is intact, albeit to a lesser extent than before, the myrmarch would have been understandably suspicious, if it were nor for the queen's mental missive to her minions commanding them to serve the xill. Now, the queen retains a presence in the minds of the myrmarchs, but it is only an echo from the past.

If a myrmarch controls a section, its death confuses the remaining formians, imposing disadvantage to all attacks, saves and checks. In addition, they lose access to their hive mind ability. If the PCs shatter the phylactery, the formians realize Chtrax duped them, and fight against Chtrax and his minions, turning on slaves, derro, giants and PCs. For more details, see Room D49 in the Great Hall.

---

## Xill Eggs and the Derro

Chtrax injected eggs into the derro and slaves serving him. Consequently, the derro and dwarf population is on the decline, as more and more of these outsiders hatch. Left alone, xill would eventually replace all the derro and slaves, being a far more disciplined work force for the evil master.

This affliction has interesting side effects. Whenever the PCs encounter a derro or dwarf, there is a 25% chance the creature is host for a xill egg. Infected derro and dwarves are at risk of premature hatching whenever they take damage. When the infected's hit points fall below half their normal total, roll 1d20. If the result is more than his hit point total, a full-grown xill immediately erupts out of its host's chest, killing him in the process. The xill spends 1 round assessing its situation before attacking the nearest non-derro. Any dwarf slaves witnessing the "birth," must succeed DC 15 Wisdom saves or become frightened for 1d4 minutes – derro see a xill hatching as a sign of their foul goddess' blessing.

---

## Constant Effects

The proximity to the vault makes negotiating these tunnels a challenge. The magical emanations have a warping effect on magnetic north, imposing disadvantage on all Wisdom (Survival) checks made to determine direction, Wisdom (Perception) checks to determine approximate depth below ground, and any other check involving navigating the depths.

The warping field extends to magic too; spells determining direction (locate object, for example) automatically fail. Worse, it effectively impedes all other divination spells. Whenever a spellcaster casts a divination spell, that caster must succeed at an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 20 + the spell's level) or the spell is lost. In addition, the field immediately deals 3d12 psychic damage to the caster and drains 2d6 spell slots (starting with the highest), as unsettling images of devils standing in a sea of blood beat against walls or some invisible barrier. If the caster succeeds, the spell dissipates without effect, and they become aware of something ominous.

Given these impediments, neither Chtrax nor his minions have any sense of where they dig, causing them to backtrack, dig towards the lava, up or down, just about in any direction. Moreover, because of the haphazard digging, the entire complex is unstable. Each hour the PCs spend in this region, there is a 10% chance of an earthquake, as per the spell, centered on their position (save DC 19).

Finally, all rooms are dark unless otherwise noted. The creatures here are accustomed to working in total darkness. The gnome designed a special alchemical material lighting areas without affecting other creatures with light sensitivity, thereby allowing a few creatures to work alongside the duergar and derro.

---

## A Race Against Time

Chtrax is close to achieving his goals. Every day, his servants come closer to stumbling across the vault. The region is highly organized, but the unusual permutations emitted by the vault distort and confound their magical efforts to locate it. The likelihood of its discovery is random; no effort, aside from random continued digging, can guarantee its breach. Realizing this, Chtrax commands his forces to dig. Their perseverance should ultimately result in the discovery and consequent breech of the unholy tomb, releasing the devils into the world once more.

### Timeline

| Day | Event |
|:---:|-------|
| **Day 0** | PCs enter the derro mines |
| **Day 1** | Nothing |
| **Day 2** | Derro miners in Room D22 break through to Room D27. The stone giant chief leads a force and exterminates the derro, slaves and beasts in the Old Mines except those derro in Room D19 |
| **Day 3** | Tarrasque reaches the first adamantine bands. All surviving formian warriors and gorgons move to Room D58 |
| **Day 4** | Tarrasque breaches first band |
| **Day 5** | Tarrasque breaches second band |
| **Day 6** | Guards and wards effect in the Old Mines ends. Tarrasque breaches the third band |
| **Day 7** | Tarrasque breaches the vault itself, unleashing the hordes of devils contained within |
| **Day 12** | The miners at Room D79 breach the vault, if the tarrasque does not |

The derro and the monsters serving them dig unworked stone. To reflect the progress through most of these rooms, expect the depth of each tunnel to continue 10 ft. each day, except in rooms near the tomb (Room D59 though Room D63, Room D78 to Room D80). These rooms are magically treated and require the tarrasque for much of the digging. In these rooms, mark progress by 5 ft. each day. Once the tunnels cross an existing tunnel the digging stops and the formian myrmarchs redistributed crews to other rooms.

Three days after the PCs first enter the complex the tarrasque reaches the adamantine bands (see the Tomb of the Devils). When this happens, Chtrax realizes he is close to his objective. At this point, he moves all formian warriors and gorgons from their respective locations to Room D58, letting those unsupervised crews do as they wish. The tarrasque breaches one adamantine band per day, finally cracking the vault and releasing the devils into the region.

The PCs have about seven days to stop Chtrax and his minions from achieving their goals. It is important to convey urgency, but without directly telling them what is afoot. While there are clues through the locations, feel free to add details to keep the PCs on track. If the PCs fail to stop Chtrax, the devils break free and pour through the tunnels, bent on killing and enslaving. For details on the devil's actions if they break free from their prison, consult the Introduction to the Vault, below.

## Rooms D1-D6: Foreboding

### D1. Sentry Tower

Standing on the broken plain is a 100 ft. tower. Instead of a roof, a large spike bears the impaled effigy of an unrecognizable humanoid. Three bas-reliefs of demonic faces decorate the surface of the structure. On the brows of each of the faces is a bright blue, red and yellow gemstone, each about a foot in diameter. Aside from the opened maws spilling reddish fluid, perhaps blood, there are no entrances into the building. A few scattered piles of broken bones litter the immediate vicinity, some partly submerged in the crimson runoff.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This encounter refers to all three watchtowers positioned at the perimeter of the derro mines. Derro savants created these towers to deter unwarned attention. With the towers complete and the savant derro dead from the flooding, Chtrax commanded his gnome servant to upgrade each of them. The gnome constructed special stone golems for the derro, placed on a spike, making the golem appear to be nothing more than part of the structure's obscene decor. Unlike normal stone golems, the gnome used petrified humanoids created by gorgon guards instead of a single block of granite, and their forms are visible in the golem's bodies.

When the heroes approach within 100 ft. of the towers, allow each of them to make a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A successful check indicates scorch marks and deep impressions on the plain approaching the tower.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The tower itself is a proximity trap. The tower targets any non-derro approaching within 100 ft. with one of the following spells once each round: *fireball*, *lightning bolt* or *ice storm*. The tower can use each spell once per day (save DC 16). The spell resets in 24 hours.

Once the tower exhausts its spells, the impaled golem at the tower's top animates and pulls itself off from the spike in a grisly display. Once on the ground, it moves to attack PCs within 100 ft. of the tower. If the PCs retreat beyond the tower' range, or fall into the lava, the stone golem remains at the perimeter for 1d8 minutes before returning to the tower.

**Treasure:** Scattered about the plain are bits of clothing, bone and the remains of others who thought to approach the complex. PCs may search the room and find a few valuables left by the fallen. The PCs discover one item every 10 minutes they spend searching: a gem worth 10d10 x 10 gp, a +1 truesilver melee weapon, a random potion, or a random minor wondrous item.

After finding all four items, or after 40 minutes of searching, the PCs find nothing else.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the wailing golem activate immediately and allow the tower to use each spell twice per day. To decrease the challenge, the tower can use one of the listed spells, once per day.

---

### D2. Statue of Supplication

At the edge of the rocky outcropping kneels a statue of a man carved from grey stone. Much of its body is worn and chipped, seemingly ancient. Its head hangs on its chest, perhaps in prayer or sleep, concealing its facial features for the most part. Behind it rise three stone mounds. Broken stone, trash and other debris litter the floor.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The statue is a stone golem (see Room D1). The derro in Room D3 positioned the golem here to warn off any intruders. Unfortunately, this golem is old and unreliable, being a prototype for those on the sentry towers. It does not function properly and only notices intruders half of the time. Chtrax, lacking the inclination or the resources to construct a replacement, temporarily positioned several derro guards in a hollow pillar of rock (see Room D3 for details) to reinforce the weakened defenses.

**Encounter Condition:** Fear 18

**Tactics:** When the PCs step onto the landing, the golem rolls a DC 10 Wisdom check to notice. If it fails the check, it does not animate unless the PC touches it, in which case it immediately animates. Due to the golem's age, it sometimes gets confused. Each round, the golem must make a DC 10 Wisdom check or suffer the effects of *confusion* for the round. If not confused, it attacks with *slow*, catching as many PCs as it can. On the next round, it grabs a slowed PC and hurls them into the smoking lava below.

This construct is under orders to fight to the death.

The wailing attracts the attention of the derro guards in Room D3. One of the derro activates the trap at Room D6, while his comrades ready their light crossbows. On the second round of combat, the derro target the PCs with poisoned bolts.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one wailing golem. To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of derro by 2 or increase the time it takes them to respond to 1d3 rounds.

---

### D3. Tower of Death

This irregular mound of stone is 25 ft. thick and 25 ft. high. Patches of multicolored fungus cling to its surface. Dark clefts and pits in the mound of rock are common higher up, and several webs with scuttling spiders fill the smaller holes.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This mound of stone is hollow. A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a false stone, when pressed, opens a secret door. On the inside of the mound stands a complex arrangement of scaffolding allowing access to the innumerable arrow slits overlooking the entire landing.

Ten derro guards man this watch tower. Chtrax positioned these unruly guards here to serve dual purposes. First, he wanted to ensure the golem functioned properly at Room D2, and if not, have a failsafe sentry. Second, confident the golem works, Chtrax wanted to remove these troublesome derro from the main operation.

Each derro knows some portion of the xill's plan, but none are smart enough to understand the significance. As no derro trusts the other, they have not collaborated to compare what they have learned. To make matters worse, the Chtrax impregnated them before exiling them to this remote tower. The master of the mines assumes the young xill will take care of the problem for him.

**Encounter Condition:** Fear 18

**Tactics:** The derro are not especially watchful and are lax about their duties. They spend most of their time arguing with each other or muttering madly to themselves in their darkened corners. Assume the derro are not looking or listening for intruders, as they expect the golem to alert them to trouble.

If the PCs open the secret door, make a loud noise outside, or do anything to draw attention, the derro rouse from their bickering and attack PCs using heavy repeating crossbows and poisoned bolts. One derro activates the trap at Room D6 by pulling a lever and joins his comrades in shooting the PCs on the following round.

The arrow slits give the derro improved cover, granting a +8 bonus to AC and Dexterity saves and a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks. There are so many arrow slits the derro can attack virtually any target with line of sight to the hollowed tower. Despite their isolation and exiled status, these derro are as crazy as any other derro, fighting to the death.

Should the PCs avoid this encounter and return later, a xill replaces one derro for each passing day.

**Treasure:** Inside the tower are four large barrels of water. There is also a ceramic pot filled with black adder venom (+2d6 poison damage), enough to coat 20 bolts.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the sneak attack damage of the derro by +1d6. To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of derro by 2.

---

## Truesilver

Truesilver is a scarce and unusual alloy of mithral and silver. Nearly never worked, truesilver loses its special properties, becoming normal silver, if ever touched by a creature other than an aberration or fiend. If forged into tools, the metal is just as good as steel. Furthermore, wholly or partially constructed truesilver enhances magic items with spell effects from the enchantment school, increasing save DCs for these spell effects by +2.

Weapons or armor fashioned from truesilver are always masterwork and confer a nonmagical +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and a +1 bonus to the armor or shields armor bonus to AC. The masterwork cost is included in the prices listed below.

Truesilver is also useful as a material component for casting spells with the good descriptor. A caster may add 25 gp of truesilver per spell level as a material component to any good spell he casts. Doing so increases the spell save DC and spell attack bonus by +1 each. Truesilver is also an exceptional material for constructing holy weapons, for it takes good spells easier than other materials during the enchanting process. A properly crafted holy symbol (GM decides requirements, crafting DC, etc.) grants a +2 to spell save DCs when used to cast a cleric spell (this effect does not stack with the bonus from expending 25 gp of truesilver mentioned above).

Truesilver weapons also deal an extra +1d6 damage against evil creatures.

### Truesilver Item Costs

| Type of Truesilver Item | Item Cost Modifier |
|:------------------------|-------------------:|
| Ammunition | +10 gp |
| Light Armor | +1,500 gp |
| Medium Armor | +6,000 gp |
| Heavy Armor | +13,500 gp |
| Shield | +1,500 gp |
| Other Items | +750 gp/lb. |

### D4. Mad Scrawl

This column of stone reaches 30 ft. high before tapering off into a sharp break. It is apparent this structure was once taller as evidenced by the debris and rubble littering the place. Otherwise, the mound appears commonplace.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This earthen column, along with Room D5, once supported a roof, but the recent instability of the caverns caused it to collapse, littering this room with debris. The uncertain flooring and debris cuts movement in half. PCs investigating the room notice with a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check graffiti on the southern face of the pillar. PCs capable of reading Undercommon make out the following words: "Hurt," "Help me," "It's inside," "Curse all my traitorous brothers and their foul master!" A fleeing duergar driven mad by his captivity found he could not escape the lava flow, and so in resignation, carved words onto the surface of the pillar. The xill egg inside him burst and the xill consumed his body, dumping the bones into the lava before wandering through the uninhabited mines.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 6

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

### D5. Trapped Column

This tower of rock extends upward some thirty feet, where it still supports part of the collapsed ceiling once sheltering this place. Rubble and bone line the floor, making the footing uncertain. Something metallic on the eastern side of this column reflects the light emitted by the lava.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The metallic sheen originates from a *permanent image* (DC 20 Wisdom save disbelieves) of a longsword stuck into the rock. The sword is a lure to ensnare the foolish and greedy, for just above the illusion is a *glyph of warding* (explosive runes).

> **Glyph of Warding Trap**  
> **Detect:** DC 22 Wisdom (Investigation) or Intelligence (Arcana) check to notice  
> **Disable:** DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disable  
> **Effect:** 8d8 thunder damage to all targets within 5 ft. Dexterity save DC 17

**Encounter Condition:** Drafty

**Tactics:** If the golem or the PCs actions did not alert the derro in Room D3, triggering the glyph alerts them. The derro respond as described in Room D3, activating the trap at Room D6, and firing poisoned bolts at the PCs from positions of improved cover.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the trap damage to 10d8. To decrease the challenge, reduce the damage to 5d8.

---

### D6. Trapped Gate

In the center of the convex surface of unworked stone is 10-ft-wide portal opening into an immense gallery. On either side of the gate, bas reliefs of derro push towards the opening as if trying to shut it. The lintel features bleached and cracked white skulls sitting in a row stop the whole width of the gate.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Unless the PCs alert or otherwise engage the derro at Room D3, the trap in this gate does not function. The derro leave the gate trap disengaged because it kills indiscriminately, and instead of killing their replacements, they opt to leave it disabled. However, combat with the derro guarantees the activation of the trap. The trap activates whenever anyone steps though the gate, causing the walls to slam shut, pulping anyone caught between. The gate automatically resets after each attack, so should someone remain in the room, it triggers again, dealing damage once more. The gate continues to slam shut and reset as long as anything occupies the room.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the PCs move past the tower of death, Room D3, and the derro inside are aware of them, the derro activate this trap in the hope of pasting a few of the invaders, while peppering them with arrows.

The slamming gate creates a lot of noise, certain to attract wandering monsters. Immediately roll for a Random Encounter each time the trap activates.

> **Crushing Gate Trap**  
> **Detect:** DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)  
> **Disable:** DC 15 Dexterity  
> **Effect:** Characters triggering the trap must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 63 (18d6) bludgeoning damage. A successful saving throw results in half damage.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the damage of the crushing gate trap to 22d8. To decrease the challenge, have the trap jam after the second activation.

---

## Rooms D7-D20: Old Mines

Derro rebels control this area, and their racial madness has worsened in isolation, making them exceptionally paranoid and delusional. Souiji, the derro's savant, sporadically sends out raiding parties into sections controlled by Chtrax to kill formians, derro slaves, and anything else getting in their way. The rebels use hit-and-run tactics to avoid capture knowing, despite their madness, they are far outnumbered.

The derro have trapped all the corridors leading to their warrens. The traps here are vicious, resulting in countless formian deaths. There are signs of formian remains throughout; their heads decorate the tunnels as grisly trophies.

Souiji leads these derro in their guerrilla war. Delusional beyond all the rest, he trusts no one, not even his fellow rebels. Once a week he sacrificed one of his servants to the goddess of the derro in a futile effort to forestall the inevitable demise they all face when the xill eggs inside them hatch. Souiji stole a *map of warding* (see Room D19) from Chtrax before fleeing from the Great Hall. He uses it at the start of each day but unfortunately it has only six charges left so he knows his time is running out. The effects of the spell cover all encounter rooms, from Room D8 to Room D24 with particular effects, included in the encounter below. Souiji has six charges starting on Day 0, and all effects attributed to the *guards and wards* spell end on Day 6.

If the PCs have not vanquished Souiji and his minions by Day 2, the miners in Room D22 accidentally break through the wall to Room D27. The stone giant chief in this uncovered room leads an expedition to kill the rogue derro, along with three additional stone giants, a formian taskmaster with two dominated destrachans and three formian warriors. Inside the old tunnel, the giants quickly dispatch all derro they find there and establish three stone giants as guards. The giants then invade Souiji's sanctuary on Day 6, killing the savant and his remaining minions. Alternatively, if the PCs dispatch the stone giant chief in Room D27 before destroying the rebel derro, the miners conceal the breach and use this exit to mount raids throughout the rest of the complex.

All rooms here are dark unless otherwise specified. In addition, a dense fog fills Room D8 through Room D24, providing half cover to all those within the shifting mists, and reducing vision, including darkvision, to 10 ft. The air stinks of rot. The walls are unworked stone and the ceiling averages 10 ft in height, while smaller, narrow tunnels are only 5 ft tall. Bones, trash, metal scraps and spider webs litter the corridors and rooms, making charging impossible and forcing PCs to succeed a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check for run actions.

### Random Encounters

Roll for a random encounter once per hour.

### D7. Old Derro Encampment

This massive gallery houses the ruins of an ancient village. The building that once filled this room now stands in ruins, shattered by chunks of fallen rock and massive stalactites. Pools of brackish water glisten in the darkness and overhead you see the tips of more stalactites emerging from the darkness of the concealed ceiling. Tunnels lead off into the fog-filled darkness as distant grinding noises echo from one of the corridors ahead.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room lies in utter ruin, destroyed by the flooding and earthquakes that ravaged the entire complex. Individual buildings lay shattered, preventing entry altogether. Random Encounters in this room should be more frequent than recommended, as wandering creatures are prone to be here as they move to the other mines. Roll for Random Encounters every 15 minutes.

Searching the ruins uncovers the remains of derro. Most of the corpses are skeletal but some are preserved. In addition to the bodies of the derro there are bones of a destrachan, a few duegar, and even a stone giant. Most of the corpses lack the capacity to speak if subject to *speak with dead* though the preserved corpses could impart the following with the appropriate questions.

**What happened in this room?** The goddess grew angry and flooded our mines with her tears (Instability of the caverns caused a lake from above to flood the caverns decade ago).

**Where are the derro now?** Dead. (As far as the corpses know the flood wiped out all of the derro.)

**What were you digging for?** I do not know. (The derro savants commanded their followers to dig, after receiving an enigmatic vision. With their destruction, their original motives are now lost.)

The corpses' responses to any other questions result in confusion or ignorance.

PCs tracking and succeeding a DC 5 Wisdom (Survival) check identify significant traffic from the north to the south. A DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check indicates light traffic to the southwest tunnel.

**Encounter Condition:** Drafty

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** PCs searching the ruins may uncover treasure in addition to the moldering corpses and trash. If a PC devotes an hour to searching and succeeds a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, he finds one of the following items: an arcane scroll (*darkvision*, *fly*), flawed sapphire (635 gp) and a pair of *gauntlets of ogre power*.

It is possible for the PCs to uncover more treasure, but the likelihood of searching this room unmolested is slim. In addition to the increased likelihood of Random Encounters, searching this room is noisy, so roll for an additional Random Encounter. After 30 minutes and whenever the PCs make a loud noise, subtract 1 from the roll (minimum of 1).

### D8. Trapped Hallway

Fog fills this corridor, muting light, and making footing uncertain. Broken spider webs hang from the ceiling, and bones litter the floor. The corridor extends as far as you can see.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Halfway down this tunnel, 30 ft. from the entrance, is a large hole in the ceiling. Several weeks ago, a pair of derro miners uncovered an unusual lump of stone covered in runes. One of them foolishly traced the rune and found himself splattered on the ceiling far above, having unlocked the stone's *reverse gravity* effect. Souiji saw this find as a boon granted by the derro goddess. Experimentation with the stone revealed he could not deactivate it, but he devised a way to put its magical properties to work.

The exiled savant commanded miners to dig a 40 ft hole in the ceiling of the entrance corridor. With sovereign glue, Souiji affixed metal rungs to the wall beneath, and glued the enchanted rock at the top of the hole in the ceiling. Every morning, he places a *magic mouth* in the pit through his casting of *guards and wards*. The result of his ingenuity is a permanent trap functioning to ensnare enemies and alert the derro to intruders.

Earlier a destrachan had the misfortune to find itself ensnared by the trap. In its frustration, it used its destructive harmonics to blast away at the walls of its imprisonment. Its rage made escape all the more difficult. By the time the PCs discover the reverse pit trap, the destrachan is enraged, ready to kill. It lashes out at anyone who passes beneath it or falls inside.

> **Reverse Gravity Pit Trap**  
> **Detect:** DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)  
> **Disable:** DC 20 Dexterity  
> **Effect:** DC 20 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the trap or suffer the spell effect (*reverse gravity*) and suffer 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Secretly make a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check for any PCs moving 25 ft. down the corridor. A successful check indicates the PC notices a series of metal rungs set into the western wall. PCs who see the rungs may bypass the trap easily. However, the destrachan with blindsight attacks the PC with its destructive harmonics attack. PCs falling into the pit must contend with the enraged monster as well as risking damage from the fall. Trapped PCs can climb up the walls to escape the ceiling pit by succeeding a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.

A PC hitting the bottom of the pit triggers the *magic mouth* created by the *guards and wards* spell. It babbles in a terrifically loud voice "There are intruders invading the sacred hall of Souiji the Mighty." The mouth repeats the message but finishes with "There are intruders..." Once the *magic mouth* ends roll for wandering monsters. Allow the derro in Room D22 a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check to detect the noise. If the derro hear the screams two of them move to the edge of the pit to investigate. With the random formian patrols killing derro, and the instability of the caverns, if the investigating derro do not return, the rest continue working, fearful of Souiji's rage.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the depth of the fall to 80 ft. To decrease the challenge, replace the destrachan with a digester.

### D9. Fusillade of Darts

Though the roiling mists conceal much, the obscene paintings on the walls of this tunnel are clear. The scenes depict imagery of blue-skinned dwarves sacrificing humanoids to warped idols, great dragons with oily black scales breathing death on fleeing orcs, and grotesque scenes of demons and devils cavorting with mortals. The pictures cover the tunnel, floors, walls and ceiling, leading to a disturbing sense of being present in the pictured hell.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** A talented but misguided and mad derro artist painted this tunnel to conceal the activation trigger of a lethal trap firing a hail of poisoned darts. The mechanism is simple – if 5 or more pounds of weight touches the pressure plate, a fusillade of darts fires up from the floor. Given the density of the paintings and the persistent fog, this trap has claimed its fair share of formian hunters and treasure seekers. Even the derro have a difficult time remembering exactly where the pressure plate lays.

> **Fusillade of Deathblade Darts**  
> **Detect:** DC 25 Wisdom (Perception)  
> **Disable:** DC 25 Dexterity  
> **Effect:** +10 to hit; 7 (2d6) poison damage (DC 20 Constitution saving throw for half damage)

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** PCs can find the trap by succeeding a DC 32 (the fog adds a +5 to the DC) Intelligence (Investigation) check. Triggering the trap causes a number of darts to fire at the PC stepping on the plate. Once per day, a single derro from room D20 comes to remove any corpses killed by the trap.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the poison damage reduce the target's maximum hit points until the end of the next long rest. To reduce the challenge, reduce the save DC by -5.

### D10. Intersection

Roiling clouds of mist fill this intersection, impeding your vision. Odd noises, clacking sounds and an occasional groan sound from ahead. Through the gloom, you see three tunnels leading away. All of the tunnels are dark and murky, filled with more of the same clammy fog. In the center of the three tunnels is a headless granite statue of a robed man with arms upraised and pointing in your direction. Then, you notice several torches bobbing down one of the tunnels. Shortly after their appearance, they disappear around a corner.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Several things happen as soon as the PCs enter this room. First, their appearance triggers the *dancing light* created by *guards and wards*. These bobbing lights appear as torches. Souiji programmed the dancing lights to appear as soon as a living creature enters the intersection at the edge of Room D11 and waits there for three rounds before moving back into the room and disappearing. The derro savant hopes to lure intruders to the *suggestion* and *stinking cloud* in Room D11 in an effort to distract and destroy them before they get too deep into his territory.

Second, the statue in the hall always faces the largest number of PCs, pivoting on its base. The derro here constructed it to frustrate and confuse intruders, hoping to stall them long enough to mount a counterstrike. However, with the derro rebels' numbers depleted, the function of the statue serves little more than as a distraction.

Third, this intersection features a *confusion* effect, making it 50% probable that the PCs believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one chosen. There is no saving throw for this.

A PC succeeding at a DC 22 Wisdom (Survival) check notices the tracks of small creatures moving from the hall leading to Room D22 to the hall leading to Room D13.

**Encounter Condition:** Drafty

**Tactics:** When the statue moves on its base, it grinds loudly, echoing down the tunnel. The derro in Room D22 are accustomed to the random noises, but if the PCs are indecisive and test the statue by moving around, three derro from Room D22 and four more from Room D20 come to investigate.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### D11. Hastily Patched Hole

The tunnels slightly widen before terminating at a cracked and fissured wall. Charred carcasses litter the floor here along with small piles of slag and ash. The room stinks of burned meat and rotten eggs. Bright light shines through the cracks of the far wall. You think you hear whistling of wind, as well.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** A week ago, a team of derro rebels, searching for a way out, accidentally broke through this wall to the lava beyond. The room filled with the molten rock and magma mephitis, killing all the miners instantly. Souiji realized this room could serve as an excellent trap. He commanded duergar slaves to erect a shoddy retaining wall, just strong enough to keep the lava out, but easily destroyed with a well-placed hit. Then, he commanded the duergar to chisel away the floor near the wall to allow more lava to fill in, should the wall fall.

With the room complete, Souiji uses a *guards and wards* (*suggestion*) to suggest to the first person entering the room that what lays beyond the wall is in fact the way out, urging them to escape. Beyond the wall the *gust of wind* blows the *stinking cloud* at the wall, so when the wall collapses, the wind blows the *stinking cloud* inside along with the lava.

The first person entering the room must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom save or take a *suggestion* to break down the wall and escape the dungeon. The wall has 15 hp and a damage threshold of 15.

**Encounter Condition:** Tremors 18

**Tactics:** If the PC reduces the wall's hit points to 0, it shatters and collapses, releasing the *stinking cloud* into the first 20 ft. of this room and forcing all inside the area of effect to succeed a DC 15 Constitution save or become nauseated and poisoned for as long as they remain inside the affected area and for 1d4+1 rounds afterward. In addition to the effects of the spell, lava splashes all PCs in the cloud's effect, dealing 21 (6d6) points of fire damage, DC 15 Dexterity save for half.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add 1d6 magma mephits and 1d4 steam mephits to the lava. To decrease the challenge, reduce the lava splash to 4d6 points of damage.

### D12. Scythe Gauntlet

This tunnel features the same clinging mists encountered since you first entered these mines. Littering the length of the tunnel are dismembered limbs and heads of strange insect creatures, and stains of green ichor splashed in random patterns throughout. The tunnel continues ahead beyond the limits of your vision.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This tunnel heads south before turning back to the east. Where it turns, three trip wires stretch across the width of the tunnel, concealed by the mists. Pressure of any kind triggers the trap, causing razor sharp scythes to snap out of hidden recesses and slash anyone in their way. On the following round, poison gas mixes with the fog, filling the air with deadly maddening poison.

A derro name R'Tobn designed this devious trap to impress his master with his ingenuity. Souiji rewarded the enterprising derro by letting him test the trap himself. A PC succeeding a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check finds the rotting severed remains of the derro inventor near the tripwires. Souiji permits no one smarter than he is to serve him.

Finding the trip wires is difficult in the poor lighting and thick fog. Worse, all three wires are at different heights, and it only takes triggering one of them to set off the trap. PCs can find the central wire by succeeding a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check. If they succeed by 5 or more, they find the other two wires.

Tripping any one of the three wires will activate the trap. Two wall scythes lash out from hidden recesses for each 10-ft. section of the hall's length. Each blade carries a virulent form of filth fever, having no incubation time and dealing damage immediately on a failed saving throw. On the following round, the hall fills with poison gas. The gas disperses three rounds after the trap triggers. Roll randomly per 10-ft. section to determine the scythes' targets.

> **Filth Fever Wall Scythe Traps** (2 per 10-ft. section)  
> **Detect:** DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)  
> **Disable:** DC 18 Dexterity  
> **Effect:** +6 to hit; 9 (2d4+8) slashing damage. Each creature hit must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or the damage reduces its maximum hit points until the end of its next long rest.

> **Poison Gas Trap**  
> **Detect:** DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)  
> **Disable:** DC 20 Dexterity  
> **Effect:** All creatures in the hall must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 7 (2d6) poison damage. A successful saving throw results in half damage.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Though the scythe blades create a lot of noise, scraping out of the hidden recesses, the derro in this section are accustomed to the trap's activation and are confident in its ability to dispatch intruders.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, double the damage of the trap. To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of scythe traps to one per 10-ft. section and remove the possibility of reducing maximum hit points.

### D13. Burrow

The long tunnel opens into a wide chamber clouded by swirling mist preventing you from gauging its actual size. Through the haze, you see debris consisting of sharp rocks and bones littering the floor. There is a definite stench of rotten meat mixed with another sharp and acrid smell. To the right, warm light shines through the fog, and to the left are sounds of metal ringing on stone.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This room serves as a large intersection connecting several smaller tunnels leading to the various lairs for the rogue derro controlling this section. In the southern end of this room are three 5-ft. diameter tunnels housing three ankhegs. The derro befriended these beasts and now employ them as guards. The light the PCs notice emanates from Room D14 where the lava has collapsed some of the floor. Otherwise, the fog effect of *guards and wards* permeates this chamber, concealing other exits from this room.

This room also carries the same *confusion* effect as found in Room D10. The confusion effect makes it 50% probable that the PCs believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they chose. The floor in this room is worse than other areas in this section. The poor footing reduces speed to half, making the Dash Action impossible.

**Encounter Condition:** Fog 10

**Tactics:** Unless a derro accompanies the PCs – these creatures learned to distinguish the vibrations made by their makers from other tremors – the ankhegs detect intruders as soon as they enter the room. The ankhegs squirm out from their tunnels and attack the nearest PC. While in the narrow tunnels, they take a -4 penalty to attack rolls and AC and move at half speed. Once out of the tunnels, the ankhegs move at normal speed, having adapted to the treacherous floor. These creatures fight to the death.

Sounds of combat attract the attention of the derro in Room D20. They come to investigate in 1d3 rounds. Allow Souiji (Room D19), a DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the sounds of the conflict. If he succeeds, he casts a few protective spells in preparation of an invader breech.

If the PCs explore this room after Day 2, remove the ankhegs and replace them with 4 formian warriors sentries.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of the encounter, add three ankhegs. To decrease the challenge, increase the number of rounds it takes for derro to investigate to 1d6 rounds.

---

### D14. Played-Out Mine

The narrow tunnel opens into a bright cave, heated to uncomfortable levels by a mass of lava fed by a hole in the wall. Here you see a sea of magma, with small creatures swimming through the molten rock, tossing globules of magma at wispy imps flying near the lava's surface. Steam clouds much of the room, concealing the details, though it is clear the footing is unusual, with ripples and waves common to flowstone. Beyond the pool of smoking magma is another tunnel leading off into more gloom, lit by the feeble light of a fallen torch. A slight tremor shakes the chamber causing streams of dust to fall from above and a rock to splash into the magma. As soon as the tremor stops, you hear someone call out to you from the darkened cave across the pool of lava.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Duergar miners, like the ones in Room D11, accidentally broke through the outer wall of this complex, flooding the room with magma. The retreating slaves fled down another tunnel where they died in Room D16. Unable to fill the breach, the derro in the rest of the section leave this room alone, fearing the lava's spread throughout the rest of the tunnels.

Each day, Souiji places a *magic mouth* inside the small tunnel on the opposite side of the pool of magma. Three rounds after a non-derro enters the room, the spell calls for help (in Common) saying, "Help...I'm trapped...Oh please help me," before falling quiet. Lying on the floor in the tunnel's bend is a small globe of light created by the *guards and wards* *dancing lights* effect to appear as a dropped torch. The effect of this is to lure invaders across the lava to expose them to the concealed *stinking cloud* triggered by their crossing.

Crossing the pool of lava should be relatively simple for PCs of this level, as they probably have the means to fly across it. However, crossing the lava triggers the *stinking cloud* laying just beneath the surface of the lava, causing the lava to bubble up and splash all crossing PCs dealing 2d6 point of fire damage and exposing those PCs to the effects of the *stinking cloud*. PCs in the area of effect must succeed DC 19 Constitution saves or become nauseated for as long as they remain over top of the lava and 1d4+1 rounds after they leave.

**Encounter Condition:** Deep Darkness

**Tactics:** The derro ignore any sounds coming from this room, as they are used to intruders falling victim to this trap.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### D15. Flow

Beyond the rift in the wall, it is clear the apparent sea of lava is in fact a wide river of molten rock flowing sluggishly into an enormous cave farther downstream. Partly submerged in the flow is an odd device, similar to a wagon, but with a large glass canister, several burned hoses and a cone at the end. The lava conceals the rest of the machine. Corpses crowd the top of the device. Some of the bodies are obviously missing legs or arms, and charred by the flow. Despite the condition of the bodies, and the burned hoses, the machine seems intact.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** The "wagon" in the lava is a magical device called a sounder (see Room D53 for details). The derro use it to determine depth and direction while digging. The gnomes constructed the machine, but with the unusual qualities of the mines, it works sporadically, occasionally unleashing a stroke of raw electricity, killing one or two slaves per discharge. This sounder and the unfortunate slaves fell into the lava at Room D11, and floated down stream before an adamantine spar beneath the surface of the magma snared it. The corpses have all succumbed to poisonous vapors, starvation and splashing lava.

If the PCs cross the lava, they attract the attention of 1d6 magma mephits and 1d6 steam mephits, who attack at once.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The mephits attack any PC crossing the stream. The magma mephits use fire on the first round to create clouds of smoke, while the steam mephits employ steam to mask their positions before closing in for the attack. Thereafter, both types of mephits use breath weapon attacks to hit as many opponents as possible.

Should the combat continue more than four rounds, 1d3 magma and steam mephits come along to join the combat. More show up every four rounds. If the PCs flee, the mephits do not pursue them.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have mephit reinforcements arrive each round. To decrease the challenge, increase the number of rounds it takes for the mephit reinforcements to arrive to eight rounds.

### D16. The Dead

Beyond the pool of smoking lava is an irregular tunnel extending 40 ft. into swirling mists before switching back towards the west. At the end of the western tunnel lie five or six bodies in a heap. The bodies are all grey-skinned dwarves and most have fatal burns. A few, though, have empty cavities in their abdomens, as if something ate its way out from the inside.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** After the derro breached the wall in Room D14, those not killed outright by the lava fled here. Most of the derro succumbed to their burns, but a few tried to dig their way free. Before they were able to make much progress, the xill eggs hatched inside them and the pupae ate their way free. Nothing lives here now.

PCs find nothing of value on the bodies. Most dropped their tools in their haste to get away from the danger. A PC succeeding a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers bloody scratches on the wall. Written in Undercommon, the markings read, "From within..."

**Encounter Condition:** Fear 18

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** A few tools are scattered about the Room, but nothing of value is found here.

**Scaling:** N/A

### D17. Barrier

*The door to this room is closed.*

This short mineshaft extends 8 feet before ending at a wall of natural stone.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Souiji wards the door leading to the derro encampment and storage facilities by concealing the door with the lost door feature of *guards and wards*. An *arcane lock* also protects the door. Even if the PCs manage to remove both magical wards, they still need to bypass the mechanical lock and the trap to get through. Finally, touching the door triggers the *alarm*, alerting Souiji to the presence of intruders.

> **Arcane Locked Iron Door**  
> **Open:** DC 25 Dexterity  
> **Hit Points:** 60 to break (triggers trap below)

> **Door Trap**  
> **Detect:** DC 25 Wisdom (Perception)  
> **Disable:** DC 20 Dexterity  
> **Effect:** 5-ft. radius poisonous fumes if triggered; DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 damage and maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken until the end of the next long rest.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If Souiji did not hear the sounds of combat in Room D13, touching the door alerts him to the presence of intruders. He orders the derro scouts sharing his quarters to take positions in the hallway using *darkness* for cover and to conceal the entrance to Room D19. Souiji casts his power-up suite of spells in preparation. These derro do not leave the safety of their tunnels nor do they retreat to Room D18.

The stone giants, if they invade, do not detect this door until Day 6. If the PCs explore this area after this day, the door is shattered.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, replace the poison with a *cloudkill* trap. To decrease the challenge, change the poison trap to a *confusion* trap (save DC 15).
