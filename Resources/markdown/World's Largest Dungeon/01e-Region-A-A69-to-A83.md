# Region A (continued)

## A69. Reserve Barracks

The door to this Room is open.

Large portions of the floor of this room are strewn with rubble. The numerous cracks in the walls do not suggest much safety. Rows of dark wooden bunk beds, most of them damaged by the rubble, give some clue as to what this area was used for.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** As a former reserve barracks, this area was emptied of anything of interest when the previous occupants left. The bunk beds are clearly designed for humanoids.

Currently Boyikt, the kobold wizard (and brother of the dead kobold leader Borryn), four kobold warriors (hp 14, 9, 8, 8), and a krenshar occupy the Room. Having escaped the orc assault and the subsequent attacks by the extraplanar beasts, the kobolds have sought refuge. They have regrouped and sometimes send scouts out for a way out of the dungeon. Presently, four kobold foot soldiers have taken the route south and then east in search for an exit.

**Encounter Condition:** Concealment, Cover

**Tactics:** The kobolds always have one of their number along with the krenshar stationed near the door keeping an eye, ear, and nose out on things. PCs using light sources are quickly spotted, and even those moving silently and in darkness cannot escape the krenshar's scent ability. The remaining kobolds have built an impromptu fort by piling stones in the southeast corner of the Room, sectioning off a 10-ft.-by-10-ft. region. This provides three-quarters cover and advantage on Dexterity saving throws and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

Once the krenshar and/or kobold guard spot an enemy, the two retreat back to a small blind near the fort gaining half-cover. The kobolds hope that danger passes them by and remain silent. If this does not work, they ambush their enemy with surprise.

While waiting to see what develops, Boyikt prepares magic missile as a held action while the remaining kobolds prepare their slings as held actions. The kobolds attack with their slings the moment the first PC steps through the door while Boyikt casts his magic missile. The krenshar holds its scare ability in readiness should the PC attempt to advance into the Room.

Once the opening shots have been fired, the combat can go any number of ways. If the PCs wish to shoot it out with distance weapons and spells, they can take advantage of the cover offered by the doorway, the rubble, and the beds. In general, this provides half cover. If they choose to charge at the fort they find the going across the rubble-strewn floor slowed (the rubble is considered rough terrain) while being subjected to Boyikt's area effect spells. The kobolds continue to fire their slings while the krenshar makes use of its scare ability; the physically smaller kobolds avoid physical combat whenever possible, only using their spears when the krenshar resorts to its natural weapons.

Boyikt holds his spells in reserve for critical moments. He picks off weakened PCs with ray of frost and acid splash, but holds his area of effect spells such as color spray and sleep until he can get maximum effect out of them. One particular combination is to cast mirror image when the PCs get too close, and then vampiric touch to keep the enemy guessing which image cast the spell. He might also cast animate dead on a fallen krenshar.

The well-prepared kobolds are a strong challenge to the PCs and if combat can be avoided it should be. The kobolds are paranoid, afraid of everything that moves and for this reason they attack any non-kobolds that come into the area. However, that does not mean they are unwilling to negotiate. After all, their situation at present is less than comfortable given not only the monsters roaming the dungeon but also the instability of this area. If the PCs choose to negotiate, either before combat starts or even after, Boyikt listens.

Boyikt's attitude is indifferent for the purpose of resolving any Charisma (Persuasion) checks concerning a cooperative arrangement once hostilities cease. If Turag (Room A28) is with the PCs, impose disadvantage on the Persuasion check. Although the exchange should be role-played rather than relying on dice. If the PCs manage to establish rapport with Boyikt then he demands an exchange of information.

Boyikt can relate his experiences concerning the battles with the orcs and the coming of the extraplanar beasts. More importantly, Boyikt believes the beasts are coming from the northeastern Region of the dungeon, and he suspects that Longtail is behind the appearance of the creatures, although how precisely that came about is a mystery. He can tell the PCs about the secret door to Room A108. The kobolds discovered it while they were securing their area but were unable to open it (let the PCs come to the conclusion that it is a one-way door on their own as Boyikt only knows they could not get the door open).

Although he is free with information, Boyikt has no intention of joining the PCs to face Longtail. He has a healthy dose of respect for the wererat sorcerer and has no intention of going to the place where he suspects all those beasts came from. If the PCs say that they are looking for a way out, Boyikt and the kobolds may become convenient allies of the PCs, but only if Turag is not with the party (Boyikt cannot be persuaded to change his mind on that point and, in fact, wants the orc dead before making any deals).

If the kobolds do accompany the PCs, they insist on being treated as equals. Of course, Boyikt is smart enough to realize that if the PCs are really heading for a showdown with the wererat (heading east is a strong clue), then he and the kobolds part ways with the PCs.

In combat, the kobolds' preferred tactics are to engage from a distance and gang up on opponents whenever possible; fighting alongside the PCs, they prefer to let the PCs do the close-quarters fighting while they pepper the opponents with sling stones, rushing in to attack and finish off weakened foes.

Being trained in teamwork, the kobolds work closely with the PCs and coordinate their attacks with them. They help out the PCs to the best of their ability, although always with an eye to their own safety, and expect the same from the PCs. Boyikt is a decent tactician and is especially adept at using his spells to the best effect. However, he will always try to hold a spell or two in reserve (usually sleep and mirror image) just in case the alliance with the PCs goes sour. In a worst-case scenario, he uses his scroll of tiny hut to escape the PCs for as long as possible.

Whenever the kobolds are on the move, one kobold warrior and the krenshar take the lead acting as scouts and they suggest the same if they are traveling with the PCs. Once the scouts have spotted something, they sneak back to the remaining kobolds and report the situation. The kobolds prefer to avoid combat when possible and sneak by opponents rather than face them. PCs that insist on fighting everything they see find the kobolds leaving them.

If facing combat, the kobolds set up an ambush in the most favorable location — one that restricts the movement possibilities of their foes while allowing the kobolds to concentrate their missile fire and using the krenshar's scare ability to prevent any enemy rushes at their positions. Because of the krenshar's good movement rate, they use the creature as bait to lure extraplanar beasts into a prepared ambush whenever possible.

**Treasure:** The kobolds have nothing to spare. Not even food. They might have some orc weapons they were able to scrounge, but even healing potions have been used to keep them alive. If the PCs kill all of the kobolds, they find Boyikt's spell book and scroll, along with some of the trapmaking parts the kobold warriors have scrapped together. If the PCs are especially kind to any of the warriors, he shares a trinket with one of the PCs — a pebble that stays warm all the time. He personally uses it when he makes soup. Another kobold may share some of his edible mushrooms that he keeps in a warm sack.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the kobolds place trip wires across the floor, requiring a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to cross the Room without tripping and falling prone. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, have Boyikt ready sleep instead and make parlay a more obvious approach to the encounter.

## A70-A77. The Rubble

While still a subset of a larger Section, these eight Rooms are daily uninhabited and ravaged by the earthquake. Only a few of these Room possess anything of value as well. Random encounters are rare here, and most of the area has already been picked through. As such, the descriptions are fairly repetitive. GMs are encouraged to mix up the contents of the Rooms by dropping non-fiendish vermin here and there. None of these Rooms are safe to rest in.

### A70. Living Quarters

The door to this Room is open.

Rubble covers the floor and spills out into the hallway. A partially collapsed archway across from the door appears to give access to the room beyond.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The earthquake damaged this Room rather heavily, and the rubble is piled at least knee-high everywhere. The archway to Room A71 has partially collapsed, although there is still enough space for a medium creature to duck through.

A tall but crude voodoo doll effigy has been left behind. It is made of leftover wood, bones, and orc hair, shaped into something awkward. Nails have been driven into the face and stomach of the doll, while burn marks cover its hands and feet.

**Encounter Condition:** Hazardous Footing 14 or Tremors 14

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### A71. Quarters

This room is slightly less damaged than the previous one, and you can still see portions of what must have been a bed peeking out from under the rubble piles.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This is another abandoned living area. The bed, although identifiable, is completely ruined. The remnants of a kobold war party ritual remain. There are bowls of coagulated blood, some candles, tied sticks, and colored chalk dust all around the ground. A severed orc hand stands out among the mundane items.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** If the PCs spent 15 minutes searching the Room, they eventually discovered a clay jar with six orc eyes inside. All of the eyes are discolored. The eyes have started to rot.

**Scaling:** N/A

### A72. Fountain Room

The eastern door from the hallway is open. The western door leading to Room A21 is closed and trapped (see Room A21 for trap description).

Chunks of rock of varying sizes create an almost mountainous terrain in this large and long room. In the center, a crushed fountain rests. Whatever was in the fountain is long gone.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Rubble fills the Room in numerous piles. Medium-sized creatures and smaller can pick their way through but must use a full action to move 5 feet in any direction, including diagonally. Note that this is not a "5-ft." step and thus provokes attacks of opportunity.

The basin/fountain that sat in the Room was crushed during the earthquake. The water was clean, and divine fish swam inside. Both are gone now. Even the meditation mats that circled the fountain are gone to the ravages of time.

There is still a faint holy energy about the place, however. This is a good place for a cleric to pray but not a safe place to rest.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### A73. Makeshift Barracks

Both doors to this Room are open. However, while the door from the hallway is perfectly normal, the doorway leading to Room A74 is trapped with a resetting color spray trap (see Room A74).

The top of a slightly dented but intact censer peeks out from the rubble in this otherwise empty room.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This large Room was yet another of a series of makeshift barracks for the orcs, but the rubble made living conditions difficult. They moved on to the east but fought off more fiendish creatures along the way.

A censer was left behind by its previous occupants as it was too big to carry.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The censer is about 4 ft. high and weighs 180 lbs. It is made of wrought iron with an uncovered bowl at its top. Bas relief designs cover the censer, revealing a very pricey item. The whole item would fetch a handsome price (250 gp) from a collector if the PCs could carry it out of here.

**Scaling:** N/A

### A74. Sleeping Chamber

The secret door between A74 and A75 is readily identifiable by a line of over a dozen iron spikes that have been driven into the space between the door and the door sill. The wedged spikes increase the Strength check required to open this door to 27, making it all but impossible to do so, especially from Room A75. Each spike is wedged in tight and requires a DC 23 Strength check to remove, although having the proper tools (such as a sledgehammer and a pry bar) grants advantage to the check.

The southern door leading to this Room is trapped and activates the moment any creature touches the door. A DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a round nozzle above the door, which might alert the PCs that this is a trap. The color spray covers the doorway as well as a cone-shaped area 15 ft. into Room A73.

> **Color Spray Trap.** Creatures in a 15-ft. cone must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm.

This room is covered with dust and rubble. You can make out stained and faded images on the walls. Mold and decay climb the walls from wet spots in the walls' deepest creases. You hold back a cough as your torchlight dances off the walls.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** N/A

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** As long as the PCs have a light source, they may notice (DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check) a glint in the rubble. Digging, they can discover a crushed gold and lead goblet amid splinters of furniture. The goblet is worth roughly 20 gp if melted down. Inside a false bottom of the goblet lies a small, thin, rusted key.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, allow a Random Encounter after the trap triggers. To decrease the challenge, reduce the DC to notice the trap by 2.

### A75. Assistant Quarters

The secret door between A74 and A75 is readily identifiable by a line of over a dozen iron spikes that have been driven into the space between the door and the door sill. The wedged spikes increase the Strength check required to open this door to 27, making it all but impossible to do so, especially from Room A75. Each spike is wedged in tight and requires a DC 23 Strength check to remove, although having the proper tools (such as a sledgehammer and a pry bar) grants advantage to the check.

The north and south doors to this Room are open.

The damage seems minimal in comparison to the other rooms in the area. There is, however, loose rubble on the floor. A number of skeletal, rust-red rodents scurry from your light.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Sniffing their way through the rubble are several dozen weak fiendish rats. They are part of a fiendish rat swarm, but not enough to be a major threat. Yet. They are what remains of the rats in Room A76.

**Encounter Condition:** Fog 10

**Tactics:** The fiendish rat swarm is spread out over both Rooms as individual members search for their own hiding places in the rubble. The moment the PCs' presence is detected, the fiendish rats in Room A75 run to Room A76. Three rounds later, a fiendish rat swarm flows from Room A76 and attacks.

This process starts the moment the PCs are detected, either through a light source or through the rodents' scent ability (30 ft. to detect presence, 5 ft. to pinpoint location). Once the fiendish rat swarm is formed, it pursues the PCs mercilessly, fighting until it is destroyed.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add three fiendish dire rats. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish rat swarm be only at half strength (half hit points and covering only a 5 ft. by 10 ft. area; all other stats remain the same).

### A76. Assistant Quarters

There is a secret door between Rooms A76 and A77. A DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the door, but a DC 20 Strength check is required to open it. The earthquake has made the door easy to spot but wedged it against the wall.

The northern door to this Room is open.

This room is slightly damaged. Only a smattering of rubble dots the floor of this massive room. Two relatively intact beds and a small table remain.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Sniffing their way through the rubble are several scores of weak fiendish rats. They are part of a fiendish rat swarm, but not enough to be a major threat. The rest of the swarm is in Room A75.

The beds, really just pallets with legs, are rubble-covered, and one is cracked. The small table is intact. Inside the desk is a letter, written in an ancient form of elvish, which the PCs may or may not be able to decipher. It details the contents of the cells (Rooms A60 through A65), though the contents of those Rooms are long gone.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** See Room A75.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add three fiendish dire rats. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish rat swarm be only at half strength (half hit points and covering only a 5 ft. by 10 ft. area; all other stats remain the same).

### A77. Experiment Room

There is a secret door between Rooms A76 and A77. A DC 14 Perception check reveals the door, but a DC 20 Strength check is required to open it. The earthquake made the door easy to spot but wedged it against the wall.

The northern door to this Room is open.

This large room shows some signs of deterioration but looks to be relatively intact. Skeletons of various sizes hang limply from a number of manacles that are attached to the wall in various places. More skeletons lie on the floor, their legs shackled via a chain to a large iron spike that has been driven into the center of the floor. A small lockbox lies against the southeast corner. It has been smashed open and some of the wood is rotted.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This Room was once used to study the effects of magic on anything and everything. The unfortunate would be shackled to the walls or shackled to the spike in the center of the floor, and various spells would course through the victim's body. PCs that examine the walls or floor see a number of scorch marks as well as places where the floor is cracked or melted.

Any intelligent creature that touches any of the manacles, chains, or the spike in the center of the floor must succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom save or fall prey to the emotional remnants that still haunt this Room. Those who save see fleeting images of torture in their minds for one round, but otherwise, nothing happens. Those who fail the saving throw are paralyzed for 2d4 rounds as the anguish of those who died in this Room floods through them. The entire experience is so powerful that it leaves the creatures shaken (disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks) for 1 hour afterward. Animals and beasts can sense the emotions in this Room and do not willingly enter it.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The lockbox is unusually heavy and radiates transmutation magic. Anyone examining the box sees remnants of an old book, now covered in mold. Instinct tells the PCs the book is over 200 years old. The book is written in common, though by a simpleton. It is filled with records of the experiments that were conducted here. GMs are welcome to detail just how grotesque the experiments were and what those effects would be on the reader.

**Scaling:** N/A

## A78-A99. The Widening Gyre

The convoluted hallways and strange locations of Rooms A78 through A99 show the celestial's dedication to traps within traps within traps. Building corridors where they were not needed, erecting secret doors to areas of no relevance, and planting traps to fill the emptiness, they befuddled and confused the prisoners of this dungeon for centuries.

The lack of logic and straightforward access made this Section a prime location for the treasure-hunting activities of the humanoids, who braved its twisting corridors and hungry traps in search of the gold promised to them by Longtail. After all, who would build something as convoluted and trap-ridden as this without having something to hide?

It was in this area that the tenuous alliance between the orcs and reptilians faltered as search teams stumbled upon other search teams, and neither side could truly tell who had the rights to which Rooms. The situation was not helped by the fact that entire search teams from both sides were wiped out by traps, naturally leading each side to believe that the other had killed them.

Currently, the area is home to large numbers of extraplanar beasts who are competing for the right to establish nests in the area. As Orghar and a few orc survivors huddle in a small Room, the orc war leader's mind slowly disconnects from reality. Finally, the lizardfolk guides have found temporary shelter (Room A96) in their search for an escape.

### A78. Antechamber

The door to this Room is open.

Rotting barrels, crates, sacks, and some archaic tools fill the space. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for how things are stored. It's as though a child stocked the room. A mixture of moisture and dust fill the room inexplicably. Bare footprints trace around the room in a meandering pattern. A hallway in the center of the opposite wall shows the way out.

The hallway leading to Room A79 is trapped (see Room A79).

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** There are dozens of small barrels (vinegar), crates, and sacks in unorganized piles. Most of them have been torn open (the barrels have their tops staved in, the crate boards torn away, and the sacks have been ripped open, some of their contents spilling onto the ground). The humanoids explored this area and then reorganized it as though they were moving in.

Along the eastern wall is a rack filled with archaic tools too large for human hands. They defy logic. Some look like pliers, and others like drills, but not anything humans would conceive of.

If the PCs rifle through the contents, they find that the barrels contain vinegar (still good), the crates contain various discarded and rotted clothing, and the contents of the sacks are now lost to the mold.

**Encounter Condition:** Smoke

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### A79. Trapped Prison Chamber

There are two mouths to the hall between Rooms A78 and A79 — north and south. The hallway is trapped at both ends with scorching ray traps. These traps trigger the moment a creature enters the hallway from Room A78 and again as they exit into Room A79.

Piles of dust and burnt bones hint at something unusual. A dead giant rat stands at the first mouth opening. Down the hallway, a pile of clothes grabs your attention.

If either Turag or Boyikt are with the PCs, they can warn them about the traps. Whether they choose to do so is up to them. Regardless, they will not enter the hallway between the Rooms.

> **Scorching Ray Trap.** Three rays of flame attack up to three targets within 10 ft. +6 to hit, 2d6 damage per ray. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) to notice, DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) to disarm. Automatically resets after 1 round.

Once the PCs have moved past both traps, read the following text.

A series of iron bollards jut up from the stonework floor in a haphazard pattern. Some bollards have been shackled. Others have sigils and glyphs etched into them. One radiates a faint green glow. The room feels evil and unnerving...

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Numerous demonic creatures were once shackled here. Over the years, they have escaped into the nearby Regions or been destroyed by particularly fearsome wardens. The bollards once contained powerful magic to keep the demons in check, but that has faded. Evil energy persists where abjuration magic once stood.

PCs with empathic powers may be able to read what has happened here. Don't ask for a roll; just provide the characters with feelings, intuition, and visions of the past.

**Encounter Condition:** Smoke

**Tactics:** Once inside, this Room is a chilling but safe place for a short rest. No random encounters happen here. The denizens know better than to tempt the traps.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have each trap fire 4 rays each time they trigger (the rays can fire at different targets). To decrease the challenge of this encounter, replace the scorching ray traps with burning hands traps, which deal only 2d4 points of damage.

### A80. Fiendish Stirge Nest

**Note:** This is a very difficult encounter, even for a 3rd-level party. PCs are encouraged to back down if their numbers dwindle. Gamemasters are encouraged to keep some stirges in reserve if too many PCs start to die.

Four extinguished and broken furnaces, one in each corner of the room, look out onto a floor littered with splintered wood. A large number of the flying bloodsuckers are hopping about the room. In the center of the room, a pale green aura fills an area about 18 inches across.

Even before the PCs arrive at the doorway, they hear the flapping and calling of the fiendish stirge swarm in this Room. The door to this Room is open and secured with a large iron spike that has been driven into the ground to prevent the door from being closed. A DC 18 Strength check is required to pull out the spike.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This area was once a workshop, destroyed years ago by escaped prisoners on a rampage. Currently, a large swarm of fiendish stirges has gathered here to make its home among the broken benches and empty furnaces. They sensed the evil here to be welcoming.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe (once the stirges are gone)

**Tactics:** There are a total of 20 fiendish stirges in this Room, making all manner of noise as they hop about, fighting each other for the ideal nesting place amidst the rubble. Due to the cacophony, the fiendish stirges have little chance of succeeding at a Perception check (they have disadvantage on the check) to hear or spot the PCs. However, any light source grabs their attention.

The fiendish stirges here are hyper-aggressive as they fight for dominance amongst themselves. Although they may notice the PCs, the fiendish stirges are not interested in pursuing them outside of the Room, so unless the PCs enter the Room, the fiendish stirges leave them alone. However, if the PCs enter the Room, the fiendish stirges attack. The easiest way to handle this is for the GM to divide the Room into quarters and assume that five or six fiendish stirges respond to the PCs whenever they enter one of the quarters while the remainder squabble amongst themselves.

The same method is also used for area effect spells cast by the PCs or their allies. Whether the spell does harm or not, an area effect spell gets a response from the fiendish stirges that are in the area. If a spell covers only one quadrant, then only the five or six fiendish stirges within that quadrant respond. If it covers two quadrants, the 10 to 12 fiendish stirges in those quadrants respond. However, unless the spell covers the entire Room, even if cast in the center no more than 10 to 12 fiendish stirges should respond.

If the PCs remove the spike from the stone and close the door, the fiendish stirges are effectively trapped in the Room. Simply exiting the Room ends the encounter, and the stirges will eventually die.

No matter how many fiendish stirges attack, they seek out their own individual targets, preferring not to share their meal with anyone; the GM should spread the fiendish stirges out among all the available targets as evenly as possible, doubling up only when necessary. Because they are defending their territory, these fiendish stirges fight to the death, pursuing fleeing PCs out of the Room but not out into the hallway.

**Treasure:** Resting on the floor, in the center of the Room, is a gold ring. It glows pale green and hums softly (if the PCs get near it). It is a ring of warmth, corrupted by the magic of the dungeon. It radiates a small degree of warmth at all times (whether or not it's worn), and its presence here makes this Room hospitable. However, should a PC touch the ring, every stirge in the Room senses the disturbance and attacks.

The ring has no negative side effects other than the glow, which cannot be controlled, and casts a permanent light spell with a 1-foot radius.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, divide the Room in half instead of quarters (meaning 10 fiendish stirges respond to an invasion of territory or a spell cast into each half). To decrease the challenge of this encounter, the fiendish stirges are not hungry. They can only drain 5 hit points each, instead of the usual 10.

### A81. Orc Guards

The door to this Room is presently open. Two orcs are on continuous duty in the doorway of this Room keeping an eye out on the hallway to the north and the secret door to the west. Both the secret door and the hallway door directly to the north of the doorway to A81 are closed.

The orc pair more than likely spot any approaching PCs, and close the door in response. The two hold the door closed as best as they can.

Read the following description when the PCs near the door.

A sturdy door stands before you. If you're not mistaken, you just saw it move. Listening carefully, you think you hear voices inside.

The door does not lock, so an opposed Strength check is required to push the door open against the two orcs holding it closed. If the PCs get inside, read the following.

Nearly a dozen orcs stand, lean, and sit around the room that disappears into the darkness beyond your torchlight. Some are clearly wounded, others stand at the ready to fight off your entrance. On the floor is a large summoning circle of some kind, drawn in salt or something similar. Candles surround it, but they are not lit.

If the PCs have seen the table in Room A20, this drawing looks familiar to them. The drawing on top of the table is a crude version of this one, redrawn from memory. Orghar saw it in Longtail's books, and he, in turn, tried to recreate it here, thinking it would help them all escape.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile; Varies

**Encounter:** Orghar personally led the attack on Room A49 intent on establishing orc control. Meeting with surprisingly stiff kobold resistance, the orcs never noticed the emergence of the extraplanar beasts from Room A103 until it was too late. Forced to retreat, Orghar and his warriors fought their way back to Rooms A81 and A82, incurring horrific losses along the way. The door was battered by darkmantles and other creatures, rendering the lock useless.

There are a total of eight orcs (hp 18, 14, 13, 13, 12, 12, 11, 10) in this Room, plus a berserker (hp 32), who is second in command to Orghar (Room A82). They are all that remains of Orghar's clan, most of them still injured from the fighting. The healthiest take turns standing guard, while waiting for Orghar's leadership.

The orcs just want him to lead them from this forsaken place.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Two orcs stand guard near the doorway at all times. One keeps an eye out on the secret door to the west, the other one on the northern hallway door. Utterly spooked by the carnage that they witnessed, the moment either of those doors open, the orcs raise the alarm, close the door, and hold it from the inside. The berserker stands behind them but does not help hold the door.

The orcs know someone is coming and cannot be surprised, but it is unlikely the PCs are surprised either. There is a moment of shock when the orcs realize they are not fiendish creatures or kobolds.

After the PCs push their way into the Room, both guards (the healthiest ones) and the berserker occupy the area around the doorway. The berserker meets the largest PC at the doorway.

The other orcs, wounded, take a round to get to their feet and ready their weapons. One orc runs to Room A82 to alert Orghar. The rest fight to the death — having nowhere left to go — but do not pursue fleeing PCs. If there is time and/or the PCs take too long getting to the door and into the Room, the berserker quaffs his potion of bull's strength.

Since the orcs hold their position within the Room, there is no immediate conflict unless the PCs attack. As such, the PCs can attempt to parley at any time. If they do not start a parley, a standoff begins. Eventually, the orcs will get gruff with the PCs and demand that they leave. Or worse.

If Turag is with the PCs, there will be questions (on both sides), but he encourages everyone to make peace. He hopes to rejoin his brethren and, if necessary, betray the PCs.

After enough time passes, Orghar arrives and demands someone speak. Though the orc attitude is initially hostile, the orcs are actually indifferent toward the PCs. Who are they anyway? Why are they here? This attitude remains even if Boyikt and his kobolds and/or Turag are with them.

Orghar's goal for his group is survival, most likely by leaving the dungeon as quickly as possible. The PC's presence indicates some hope in this regard. Regarding his own life, he does not care anymore.

If the PCs suggest an alliance, Orghar suddenly comes to life. Seeing this as a challenge to his power, the clan head dismisses talk of an alliance. Instead, he orders an attack on the PCs. How this situation evolves depends on how the PCs have acted and how the orcs perceive them.

If the PCs are obviously injured or in some way act inexperienced or unsure, the orcs do as Orghar commands, and a full-scale battle to the death begins. If the PCs have the orcs' respect, the warriors stand there unsure of themselves.

This vacillation angers Orghar. Calling up his rage, he attacks the PCs. Some of the orcs join the fight; others do not. Orghar has no intention of losing the leadership of the clan and fights to the death.

If the PCs kill Orghar, the remaining orcs propose an alliance with the PCs. The strongest of the remaining orcs suggests they work together to escape the dungeon.

While the orcs will work with the PCs and even battle alongside them, they do so with plans of eventually betraying their allies. As long as they fight the beasts, the orcs are highly motivated to do their part, but when facing anything else, they mind their own safety and let the PCs carry the brunt of the fighting.

If Boyikt is with the PCs, he encourages the PCs to attack along with his troops and finish the orcs off. If the PCs refuse, he baits the orcs, perhaps even casting a spell into the doorway, in an effort to start a fight. However, he does not engage the orcs while they have the tactical advantage. PCs can attempt to defuse the situation as they see fit, but the kobold wizard has a hostile attitude towards any suggestions of an alliance with the orcs. Feel free to assign positive modifiers to attempts at Charisma (Diplomacy) checks with the kobold wizard if the PCs have saved the life of Boyikt or his kobolds. There is no way to convince the kobold wizard to ally with the orcs; either the PCs give up this idea of an alliance with the orcs, or the kobolds leave. If the PCs are foolish enough to try to stop the kobolds, the kobolds fight.

If Orghar arrives and there is a fight already in progress, he joins the combat with gusto, gaining an advantage on all rolls during the first round (the ring he wears drives him to kill, even in his defeated mental state). However, his malaise takes over two rounds later, in which he suffers one disadvantage on his first roll and one disadvantage on another roll the following round. Unless he sees some hope in the fight, Orghar eventually lowers his ax, gives up, and lets the PCs win, whatever that looks like in your game.

If Orghar dies while the others fight, the healthiest orc screams out with a battle cry, declaring himself the new clan leader. The rest accept until the battle is over and then fight amongst themselves for leadership.

This is most likely a bloodbath.

**Treasure:** Collectively, the orcs carry maybe 15 gp in various denominations, some trinkets, and their weapons. They have no magic, and only the berserker possesses a potion, which he most likely has already drunk.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add four fully healed orcs or two berserkers. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, the orcs (not the berserker) are shaken.

### A82. Orghar's Solitude

The door to this Room is open. Whether the PCs negotiate or fight their way past the orcs in Room A81 to get to this point, the text is the same.

A smaller room lies mostly barren, with floor mats, blankets, and some general adventuring gear strewn about the floor. Dirty candles have been knocked over and snuffed out.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This is Orghar's private chamber. He is head of the clan of orcs that followed Longtail to the dungeon. Having watched virtually all his clansmen die at the hands of the extraplanar beasts has caused his mind to drift.

Orghar is tall and powerful. Even for an orc, he stands half-a-foot taller than most. His face is a maze of scars, showing his experience in battle. Perhaps his prowess could be questioned, but his survival rate cannot. His left eye is missing, replaced with a glass eye that doesn't match. It gives him a slight advantage when attempting to intimidate someone. There are tattoos all over his arms and neck, one for each battle he has won.

No longer interested in anything, he spends his time in this Room, lost in private reverie. He is morose and expects to die at any moment. His clan thinks he is dreaming up a plan for escape, but he has truly given up.

Orghar's reputation within the clan is so great none of his clansmen attempted to replace him, even though he has led his clan to its demise and is exhibiting signs of mental illness. They have that much respect for him.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** One way or the other, Orghar has made it to Room A81 before the PCs find this Room.

**Treasure:** Orghar's ring is a plain, unadorned circlet. It fits any finger perfectly.

**Orghar's Ring:** *(Ring, Very Rare, Doesn't Require Attunement)*

While wearing the ring, your alignment changes to the next in sequence (so Lawful Good would become Lawful Neutral; Neutral Good would become Neutral; and so on). You gain advantage when making a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidate) check against and with an evil creature.

**Scaling:** N/A

### A83. Holy Illusory Fire

The smell of burnt flesh and leather hangs heavy in the air.

This smell is part of the illusion. The door to this Room is closed and trapped; a fiery elemental-type creature is painted on the door. Describe it however you like to the PCs, as they've probably never seen one before. A fire spell triggers the moment a Tiny or larger creature touches the door. A large glyph signals the presence of the trap, however.

> **Fire Trap:** Fire erupts in a 10 ft. radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 (illusory) fire damage or half on a successful save. DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) to disbelieve.

Once the door is open, read the following.

The lighting inside the room is strange. There is a gray-blue glow coming from somewhere, but it is unclear where the source is. The ceiling, floor, and walls of the Room are covered in a thick layer of burnt slime. Embedded in the far wall is the imprint of an angelic shape, like a fossil cracked out of a stone. A simple, colorless glass sphere rests atop a stone pedestal in the center of this room.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The temperature of the Room is extremely hot, though this is an illusion. Characters spending too much time here suffer 1d4 damage (no save). Repeat this as often as necessary.

Turag and/or Boyikt do not trust this area of the dungeon. While they do not know this Room, they lost enough allies in this area that they will not enter. They will adamantly refuse, going so far as to fight a PC not to enter this Room.

A one-foot-diameter glass sphere rests atop an ornate pedestal. Glyphs and sigils cover the edges and legs. The glass appears to have something fiery inside, though it is blurry and unclear. It does not look humanoid but rather ghostly. Should a PC touch the sphere, the fire revenant inside ignites the PC's hand and escapes into their body.

**Encounter Condition:** Extreme Heat, Smoke

**Tactics:** The PC appears to be on fire, but this is an illusion. The fire revenant is just a trickster spirit. It cannot harm the PC, but the PC will not know that. Each round, they will make contested Wisdom checks to see who controls the PC's body for one turn. This continues until the PC has won three contests in a row or the PC is knocked unconscious.

Regardless, the revenant then escapes and dissipates into steam. If the sphere is left in the Room, the fire revenant returns in one week. If the PCs take the sphere with them, it is extremely warm and heavy and makes for a nice centerpiece. Maybe it's worth something.

Once the PCs have had a chance to rest, they realize the illusory fire damage isn't real, and all of it heals, except for any damage the PCs dealt to one another.

**Treasure:** A careful examination of the angelic imprint on the wall reveals a silver coin in the angel's hand. It can be pried from the wall and taken as a fire token. Once removed, the coin feels thin and brittle. It is a one-use casting of fireball (6d6). The PCs won't know exactly what it does until they flip/hurl the coin.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, allow only half the damage to heal after a rest. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, allow the PCs to use the glass sphere to summon one fire elemental one time.
