# Region C (continued)

## C20. ARUM'S FORMER LABORATORY

Piles of rubble and cracked stone blocks along the walls take up most of the floor of this chamber. Inside the room, an immense mound of debris is splayed out upon the ground in front of a gaping hole in the eastern wall. The rest of the chamber is a jumble of crushed timber and broken glass strewn about the larger pieces of stone. The west wall is scorched, especially around the entrance to the room where an overturned forge lays cold and broken against the wall.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

This room is the former laboratory and living quarters of the wizard Arum. Judging by the ground and dispersal pattern of the explosion, the hole in the eastern wall is where the forge was located before the wall broke. There is a faint residue of abjuration magic coming from the crushed forge. If PCs examine the forge closer, they can attempt a DC 23 Intelligence (Arcana) check to decipher the magical runes written inside as wards that reflect the heat and energy of the forge back into itself.

PCs succeeding at DC 19 Wisdom (Perception) checks find several books wedged under the mass of stones and boulders. It is clear the books are damaged, but they may be of some use, if the PCs can find a way to move the massive blocks to retrieve them. Most of the blocks of stone in the room weigh more than 500 lbs. each, and many smaller boulders must be removed before the larger ones can be pushed aside. Anyone attempting to clear the rubble must make three separate DC 17 Strength checks. For each Strength check made, one book can be recovered. No more than one Strength check can be made every 15 minutes. PCs failing to rest after each check suffer cumulative points of Exhaustion every half hour.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

### Treasure

There is no treasure here unless the PCs remove at least three of the undamaged books from under the stones. Anyone proficient with Intelligence (Arcana) gains a permanent +2 with the skill after spending one month reading the fragments of these three books. No further advantages are gained for reading more books, but a total of seven can be recovered.

**Scaling:** N/A

## C21. BROKEN PRISON OF FALORTULIGO

This enormous, one hundred ft. tall room is noticeably colder than other rooms in the area. Four massive chains hang like pillars from the ceiling at even intervals in the center of the chamber. Coiled upon the ground amid the last few links hanging from the ceiling are four more impossibly huge chains. The shackles at the end of each chain are twisted and warped, as if something of immense strength broke its way free. The rest of the vast room is surprisingly empty, save for the large blue runes encircling the chamber and an ornate archway on the north wall. The runes emit a faint, steady, and oscillating glow, as if imitating the breathing patterns of an enormous sleeping beast.

**Initial Attitude:** Friendly

### Encounter

PCs succeeding at a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check realize the chains have properties of cold iron and adamantine. The PCs who make such checks also know it should not be possible to combine those two metals, since one is forged at low temperature and the other at extremely high temperatures.

The ornate archway on the north wall has intricate designs surrounding a curtain-like interior. The surface of the archway is solid, but has a fluid sensation to it. There is no way to pass through the archway from this side.

A few minutes after the PCs enter the room, Zrino (a lantern archon) arrives through the archway from Room C110. PCs succeeding at a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check see the creature pass through the magical entrance. The archon gives the PCs information regarding the prison and its current state, as well as providing background information about this room (including what little it knows about its former occupants).

Zrino's primary task is to inform the PCs that a special key (in Room C105) lends access to another door in the dungeon. The archon describes the key and indicates it lies to the southeast, but to get there, the PCs need to deal with danger along the way. The PCs also need the Mark of the Righteous, for only those who are blessed with this mark can open the door leading into the room where the key lies. The archon is able and willing to give the mark to those who want it, except for evil-aligned characters.

#### Mark of the Righteous

The Mark of the Righteous endows a permanent +1 bonus on all saving throws for good characters. Neutral characters are unaffected by its effect. If a character with the mark ever becomes evil, he loses the bonus and suffers a -2 luck penalty on all saving throws for as long as they remain evil or until the mark dissipates. The archon Zrino gives the mark by shining a light on the palm of any non-evil character wishing to receive it. Close examination of a marked hand shows a faintly glowing sigil upon the palm. A DC 25 Intelligence (Religion) check reveals this sigil as an ancient symbol denoting righteousness or proven goodness. The mark lasts for 1d3+1 months, after which time it disappears from the character's palm entirely. The Mark of the Righteous also grants the bearer the ability to read and understand Celestial, but not speak it.

If the PCs ask for aid, the archon replies in a musical voice, "I can give you light for your eyes and illumination for your mind, but our paths do not cross." Zrino casts continual flame (up to twice per PC) on any item the PCs want enchanted. Aside from the information regarding the prison and the special key, he knows little about the inhabitants of the region or the current state of affairs in any region other than C and G.

If questioned about Arum, Zrino simply says, "The wizard is long gone." Zrino is one of the few inhabitants of the region who knows this. If asked about a cure for petrification, the archon states, "Gahrr'k has what you seek, but does not help others."

**Encounter Condition:** [Fear 15], Fearless, Hallowed 3, Positive Energy

### Tactics

If anyone attacks Zrino, he activates Aura of Menace and then flies out of range. If the PCs pursue, he attacks with a scorching ray each round after the first. Since Zrino cannot be fully killed (returning in one month's time due to the magic of the dungeon), he fights to the death.

In the event the PCs halt their attack, a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check convinces the archon to cease fighting as well. Evil PCs receive Disadvantage to that check.

### Treasure

PCs searching the room for at least 1 hour are allowed a DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check to find a single loose stone in the floor. The stone is protected by a glyph of warding (Explosive Runes) and a lock that requires a DC 27 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check. If opened, the stone can be lifted up. Under the tile is a long strongbox, large enough to store a longsword. The strongbox has another glyph of warding (Explosive Runes) on it and requires a DC 27 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to open it. Both the tiles and the box are indestructible. Inside the box is a magical **+3 longsword**.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two lantern archons. To decrease the challenge, remove the Fearless Condition.

## C22-C28. NEUTRAL ZONE

Originally, the section comprising Rooms C22-C28 was a processing station for the smaller prison cells to the east and west. When an enormous earthquake tore a jagged chasm into the foundation of the dungeon prison hundreds of years ago, this region was all but abandoned.

For the last ten years, the rooms in this section were claimed by different inhabitants, including goblins (from Region B) and gnolls from the Gnashing Fang Tribe (Rooms C29-C42). Before then, it was patrolled and monitored by the Paladins of Merunda, though they lived elsewhere in the region. Today, however, the section is primarily a buffer zone between the goblin and gnoll factions.

The rooms in this area are spattered with long-dried blood and gore, showing signs of many battles. Though the halls are much cleaner than the rooms, most doors have crude markings upon them. Whether these marks are warnings, territorial boundaries, or something else does not seem to matter, as they have been crossed out and written over countless times. These marks extend to some of the walls in the area, but are primarily focused upon the doors and archways.

### Random Encounters

Roll for a Random Encounter once per hour.

| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | A lone gnoll from the Gnashing Fang Tribe investigates the noise the PCs have created. He's actively hiding and watching from the shadows, eager to report back and bring reinforcements if necessary. |
| 2 | A breeze cuts through the section, chilling the PCs and threatening to blow out torches and lanterns. |
| 3 | The sounds of battle and howling echo through the section. |
| 4 | A bloody gnoll fang lies in the room, obviously ripped from the creature's mouth. |
| 5-12 | Nothing |
| 13-14 | Four gnolls (from the Gnashing Fang) scout the perimeter of their territory. They enjoy light conversation while they talk, keeping an eye out for intruders. |
| 15-16 | Five goblins scout the section. They engage the PCs (if necessary), but flee and scatter as soon as one falls in combat. |
| 17 | 2d8+8 goblins from Region B and four gnolls from the Gnashing Fang Tribe are engaged in combat. The sound of battle is abrupt and loud enough to wake sleeping PCs. Another 2d6 gnolls arrive to support the battle 1d4 rounds after the PCs are made aware of it. The goblins sound a retreat if the PCs join the fight. The gnolls attack the PCs, regardless of their actions or intent. If the PCs do not interfere, the goblins lose half their forces and retreat, while the gnolls suffer 1d3 casualties and carry off all dead gnolls and goblins back to their territory. |
| 18 | The PCs stumble upon a trap. Two sword blades strike from each side of the room when a PC steps on a 10-ft. square pressure plate. The blades are 3 ft. long and 4 ft. from the ground. They alternate directions after each attack, automatically resetting 1 round later.<br>**Double Blade Trap.** Detect: DC 15 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 16 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools); Characters in a 10-ft. square area DC 15 Dexterity save or take 1d6+8 piercing damage each. |
| 19 | The PCs stumble upon a trap. An audible alarm goes off, followed by confusion, affecting everyone within a 15-ft radius. The alarm can be heard by everyone within 120 ft. Immediately roll for a second encounter, ignoring results of 17, 18, and 19.<br>**Confusion Trap.** Detect: DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana); Disable: DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters in a 10-ft. square area DC 16 Wisdom save or suffer from confusion. |
| 20 | Nurganar (Room C9) searches. When encountered, he asks for a tribute of 100 gp from each PC. If the PCs pay up, Nurganar talks with them. Since he travels everywhere, he knows about the region. |

## C22. GREASE TRAP

There are two words written on the door. One is a small Goblin marking and the other is a large rune written in Gnoll. Both say "TRAP."

The walls of this room are black, but the floor is covered in a greasy residue that has an unpleasant smell. There is a small, black, unmoving shape lying near the opposite corner of the chamber. The dark color of the walls and floor makes it difficult to pick out any other features in the room.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

After the door is opened, the trap triggers. There is a 1d6-round delay, before burning hands is cast from the corner nearest the door, directly towards the floor. Anyone standing in the doorway is hit and must succeed at a DC 14 Dexterity save for half damage or suffer 3d6 fire damage. In addition, the trap simultaneously lights the grease on fire, causing 1d6 points of fire damage per round to anyone caught inside the room. The grease fire burns itself out in 10 rounds and the trap resets itself after another 10 rounds.

**Burning Hands and Grease Trap.** Detect: DC 19 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)

Anyone searching the room, before or after it is set on fire, must make a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice that the walls are heavily caked soot. PCs succeeding at a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check also find charred bits of bone and metal about the floor.

**Encounter Condition:** [Smoke]

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add lightning bolt to the trap, 1d10 rounds into the fire. To decrease the challenge, remove the grease.

---

## C23. KILLER TRAP

The stench of decaying flesh lingers here. The nauseating odor is almost certainly caused by the rotting gnoll and goblin corpses lying upon the floor. They appear to have no wounds on them, but the look of terror on their faces is a testament to the violent nature of their deaths.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

A phantasmal killer trap is set in this room that affects the first person entering it. Anyone witnessing the spell sees only a vague shadowy shape. This trap resets itself one minute after being triggered, but is only sprung again when PCs re-enter the room. PCs already in the room do not trigger the spell again.

**Phantasmal Killer Trap.** Detect: DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana); Disable: DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters entering room must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom save or suffer from phantasmal killer.

**Encounter Condition:** [Smoke]

**Tactics:** N/A

### Treasure

PCs searching the bodies find various personal effects.

The gnoll has four knucklebones used for gaming in a belt pouch, but one has slightly different markings. Anyone finding the bones can make DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to identify the odd bone as an archaic (but functional) **thunderstone** (thrown against a hard surface it casts thunderwave at 3rd level. Destroyed upon use). Amidst the remains of the two goblins the PCs find a short sword, a rusted dagger, and 1d4 cp.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a burning hands to the phantasmal killer trap. To decrease the challenge, replace the phantasmal killer trap with a magic missile trap.

---

## C24. DEAD GHOUL ROOM

This door seems normal at first, but it's locking mechanism is partially melted. The hinges of the door seem intact, if a bit rusted. Were it not for the mangled lock, this door would not be worth noting.

There is a desiccated corpse in the middle of the room. It is so skeletal and unnatural that it must be an undead creature. It was leaning against the door, as if trying to claw its way out, but it is no longer moving. The only thing remarkable about the corpse is the fascinating silver necklace around its neck.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

These are the remains of a ghoul trapped here by the wizard Arum. It is still alive, although the necklace is constantly draining its strength. Thus, the ghoul remains helpless even if the necklace is removed, as it has been trapped here for years.

**Encounter Condition:** Haunted, Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** N/A

### Treasure

The necklace is a simple silver medallion with the word "sloth" written in Elven. It is cursed and affects any creature with a Strength score that wears it. Every day it's worn, the necklace deals 1d4 points of Strength damage (at midnight). If this reduces the character to 0 Strength, the character dies. The strength loss is permanent for as long as the necklace is worn, and it cannot be removed by any means save remove curse. A restoration spell restores all lost Strength provided the necklace has been removed. Without the aid of magic, Strength lost this way returns at a rate of 1 per day once the item has been removed from its victim.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the necklace deal 1d6 points of Strength damage. To decrease the challenge, allow the victim to attempt a DC 18 Charisma saving throw each morning, removing the necklace on a success.

## C25. OPEN HALLWAY

The hallway opens into a small chamber before continuing to the east. There is a dark red stain smeared on the floor, as if something were dragged down the eastern corridor.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The red stain is a trail of smeared blood leading to Room C28.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 2

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## C26. SMALL CLOSET

The door to this small room squeaks open. Inside is a goblin. The creature is dressed in dirty clothes and sobs.

**Initial Attitude:** Neutral

### Encounter

The goblin's name is Ratul, which means "stupid weakling." He was a scout for the Goblin King (Room B5), but never provided satisfactory information. In truth, Ratul is an exceptional scout. But he's timid and less evil than his kin and therefore unwilling to help the Goblin King in his quests.

Ratul continually pulls up a glorified rag that skirts his waist. He is covered in cuts and scars consistent with the lashes of a whip. Ratul is too shocked to speak at first, but he's ultimately relieved to meet someone who isn't a gnoll or goblin.

If the PCs question him, Ratul pleads for mercy, offering his services as guide and scout. Anyone who makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check senses Ratul's sincerity. If the PCs threaten him, Ratul becomes afraid and unresponsive once more. If the PCs attack, he offers no defense. Ratul is familiar with the layout of Rooms C19-C31 and will not willingly travel west into Region B, east past Room C29, or into Room C32. Unless the PCs succeed at a DC 25 Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, nothing convinces him to travel to those rooms. If the PCs treat him as a captive, or force him to go where he doesn't want, Ratul escapes the first chance he gets.

If the PCs talk to him, Ratul gives out any information he has about the area. He describes a great "army of dogmen" to the east, and their war with the Goblin King to the west. He also knows the "dog king," named Gahrr'k, has "a small jar of grease that makes statues come to life." Ratul witnessed Gahrr'k using the stone salve on one of his lieutenants in Room C19, but he never saw the cockatrice or gargoyle. Finally, Ratul knows that the gnolls and goblin armies avoid this area because of the ghouls in Rooms C27 and C28. He chose this region as a hiding place because he does not believe anyone else knows the ghouls were destroyed.

If Ratul joins the PCs, he refuses to assist in combat. In fact, the person who is most kind to Ratul suffers a -2 AC penalty in any combat situation, as the goblin clings to that character's leg while in battle. Ratul, however, remains true to his word as long as the PCs do not betray him or leave him unprotected.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## C27. GHASTLY MURAL

Aggravation emanates from crude drawings on the walls here. The images are barely recognizable, as the paint used to draw them has faded over time. In the southeastern wall of the chamber is a tiny structure built from gnawed bones. The roof of this miniature house is incomplete, but is otherwise surprisingly detailed. Along the eastern wall, nine white carved figurines are lined up next to the house.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

Anyone studying the paintings upon the wall is eventually able to discern terrible pictures of horrifying acts of violence. Each PC studying the murals imagines they see something different. The pictures are not magical, but made to inspire the most dreadful imaginings of those who behold them.

PCs searching the wall behind the bone figurines are allowed DC 24 Wisdom (Perception) checks to find a 5-ft.-tall secret door leading to Room C28. The cramped, cobweb-filled corridor should unnerve all but the most seasoned adventurers. Medium or larger PCs must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become shaken while inside the passageway. Anyone failing the initial save must make another DC 20 Wisdom saving throw to prevent becoming frightened when they find the secret door on the other end of the corridor wedged shut (see room C28 for further details).

Anyone succeeding at a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check can identify the bones as those consistent with humanoid creatures. The corpses are those of three gnolls and a human, but the latter has dry and sickly flesh mashed almost beyond recognition.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Visions 4, Haunted

**Tactics:** N/A

### Treasure

A PC succeeding at a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check determines the miniature house or bone figurines hold no value.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## C28. GHAST TOMB

A pile of crushed rocks is piled in the southeast corner of this chamber, blocking the hidden panel behind and making it impossible for anyone to enter this room via the secret corridor beyond. PCs clearing the debris are allowed a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the secret wall panel, which opens into the narrow corridor beyond (see Room C27).

A cloud of stench lingers close by. The trail of blood leading from the corridor to the door continues into the chamber, past the half-opened doorway. The room seems empty except for a pile of crushed stone boulders in the southeast amid the remains of several creatures lying upon the floor in the northwest corner.

Entering the room disturbs a cloud of flies hovering above the corpses. A closer look inside reveals the former occupants were smashed into a mealy pulp. The stench obviously emanates from the corpses.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

Anyone succeeding at a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check determines there are at least three gnoll corpses in the pile of bones in addition to the remains of the ghast. The gnolls have been dead less than a month, and were torn apart before being left to rot. The gnoll corpses seem to have been purposely dismantled to prevent reanimation.

Gahrr'k, the gnoll chieftain (see Gnashing Fang Tribe and room C37), destroyed the ghast a few weeks ago, but no one other than the chieftain and Ratul knows that. Gahrr'k plans to use this room, but is airing it out until it's hospitable.

**Encounter Condition:** Desecration 4, Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

## C29-C42. GNASHING FANG TRIBAL GROUNDS

Nine years ago, a hunting party from the Howling Fang Tribe stumbled upon the entrance to the prison. The tribal Chieftain, Hag-grt, decided the tribe needed an additional lair and sent one-third of his tribe into the dungeon to pave the way for the rest of his people. Hag-grt, however, never intended to enter the underground prison.

The Howling Fang Tribe was now too large to control, and Hag-grt too old to fight off younger and stronger gnoll challengers. Wise as he was, he sent the toughest gnolls into the dungeon and remained with a smaller tribe; one he could control without competition.

So it was, that a band of 85 gnolls entered the dungeon. They had great success at first, scaring off or killing many humanoid races and fiendish beasts surrounding the entrance. But over time, they found the dungeon's massive, sprawling tunnels too difficult to navigate and soon became lost. Discord broke out among the gnolls and a demand for leadership reared its head. Two vile gnoll brothers, Gahrr'k and Yie-ar'k, barked challenges, each claiming leadership of the group.

After some discussion, Gahrr'k agreed to support his brother, Yie-ar'k. But the gnolls did not all agree that he should lead, and one by one, the gnolls stepped forth to contest his leadership. After six challengers, a young hot-headed gnoll named Attuk'k stepped forward and, in a ferocious battle, crippled Yier-ar'k. Although Attuk'k was defeated, Gahrr'k stepped forward and decapitated both of them, assuring his place as leader of the tribe. After that, no one challenged Gahrr'k's right to lead.

Gahrr'k (Room C37) took the remaining gnolls and formed what became the Gnashing Fang Tribe. Gahrr'k then led his tribe further into the dungeon prison. By the time the gnolls realized that he never intended to leave the vast underground complex, they had little choice but to follow their chieftain.

Sometime after entering the dungeon, Gahrr'k met the Goblin King, Argliss. Though unafraid of the goblin, he worked out an immediate agreement with Argliss rather than fight (especially without a lair of their own yet). Gahrr'k discovered Argliss was fearful of the wizard Arum (to the east), and volunteered to kill the wizard in exchange for a vague alliance between their two tribes. Thinking either the wizard or the gnolls would be destroyed by such an alliance, the Goblin King agreed, sending along 20 of his own warriors to assist. Gahrr'k left the Goblin King's domain and paused in Room C29 to inspect his new forces. He charged forward to fight the wizard, but soon realized Arum had left the region long ago.

Gahrr'k then took 14 goblins as slaves and killed the other six as an example. In the next few months, Gahrr'k sent several reports to the Goblin King. These reports described deadly battles fought against the wizard Arum, but in truth Gahrr'k's tribe never found the wizard.

| 20 | Nurganar (Room C9) searches for treasure. When encountered, he asks for a tribute of 100 gp from each PC. If the PCs pay up, Nurganar talks with them. Since he travels everywhere, he knows about the region. |

As the months went by, the gnoll chieftain requested more goblin reinforcements, and each time the Goblin King sent to their deaths. Gahrr'k, however, grew careless with the arrangement and a goblin eventually escaped slavery, and returned to tell his king of the gnolls' treachery. The goblins and gnolls then waged war against one another, and both factions lost a great number of warriors. Now, the two groups have troubles of their own and avoid each other almost entirely.

The first encounter between the PCs and the Gnashing Fang Tribe might not be a surprise meeting at least not for the gnolls. They guard the eastern access (Room C38) and regularly patrol the various western entrances. Despite their chaotic nature, discipline is high among the gnoll warriors. With so few remaining their very survival depends on it.

The gnolls do not attack unless the PCs strike first. They parley with PCs and will listen to offers of diplomacy or trade. If the PCs convince the gnolls that they mean them no harm, they are escorted directly to Gahrr'k (Room C37). The chieftain is willing to parley with non-hostile PCs and cut a deal with them (see Room C37).

If the PCs attack any gnoll before being allowed passage, the remaining gnolls overwhelm the PCs and take them prisoner. If combat occurs, the gnolls capture the PCs first, using non-lethal damage. If the PCs killed at least one gnoll (and the gnolls know about it), every further encounter with the Gnashing Fang Tribe is hostile. If the PCs gain an upper hand and corner Gahrr'k, he challenges a single PC to an honorable duel. If he wins, he offers amnesty to any other PC who swears fealty to him.

## C29. WESTERN GNOLL MUSTERING ROOM

This large room has a door in each corner and one set into the eastern wall. The floor suggests a high traffic volume, with several scuffed paths worn out between each door. The walls are completely covered in filth, as if painted in blood.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

Regular traffic from the gnoll encampment moves through here. A group of gnolls on patrol pass through the room once every two to three hours. A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check will determine that the walls have been spattered with blood repeatedly. The blood is thicker near the doors, but is fairly even throughout the room. The blood seems to be nothing more than a warning to enemies.

Though this room serves as a means of passage, the gnolls from Rooms C33 and C35 remain alert. When the PCs are in this chamber, allow the gnolls a Wisdom (Perception) check (Disadvantage for distance) to notice their presence. Once they notice the PCs, the gnolls from Room C33 enter this room using the eastern door 1d4+1 rounds later. 1d3 rounds after they arrive, more gnolls from Room C34 come through the southeastern entrance. These warriors are well trained. However, like all members of their tribe, they are willing to parley with PCs that come in peace.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Tactics

If a fight breaks out, the gnolls take the PCs prisoner rather than fighting to the death. If this is not possible, they fight ferociously, sending gnolls one at a time for reinforcements if the battle goes poorly for them.

If the PCs keep quiet and are not discovered, roll for a random encounter after 30 minutes in this room.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, allow the gnolls in Rooms C33 and C35 Perception checks without Disadvantage. To decrease the challenge, do not allow them to make a perception check.

## C30. WEAPONS STORAGE

Nothing can stop the rusted hinges from squeaking when the door is pushed open. The sound alerts the gnoll guards in Rooms C33 and C35 if they succeed at DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks. If they hear the distinctive sound, the gnolls from Room C33 will enter Room C29 using the eastern door 1d4+1 rounds later. More gnolls from Room C35 come through the southeastern door 1d3 rounds after the warriors from Room C33. These warriors are prepared for anything and remain in Room C29 to block the only available exit from this storage area.

The door to this room squeals loudly when opened. The place seems to be an armory or storage area holding a range of weaponry. A few of the larger weapons are placed in unevenly constructed wall mounts, but most are simply piled up on the floor.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

This is the Gnashing Fang Tribe' stockpile of unused weapons. Since the members of the tribe train exclusively with only a few different types of weapons, the items gathered here (gathered from the surrounding areas over the years) are seldom used. Many of the weapons are in excellent condition, but after years of abuse and neglect, none can be considered masterwork quality anymore. The gnolls have no use for these weapons, but they do not allow anyone to take any of them without permission from their chieftain Gahrr'k (Room C37).

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 4, [Safe]

**Tactics:** N/A

### Treasure

With the exception of warhammers, battle axes, great axes, and clubs, nearly any type of standard melee weapon can be found in this room. The weapon sizes range from small to large and there is a 25% chance of any particular weapon being present (roll once per weapon type).

**Scaling:** N/A

## C31. HAUNTED ROOM

The floor of this large chamber is scattered with piles of crushed stone, bits of broken weapons and furniture, as well as rotting wood. Amidst the rubbish, the shape of four humanoids can be made out. One of these silhouettes looks human, but the other three are tall and have canine faces. The creatures' bodies are pale where their flesh is exposed, and their gaze is empty.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

### Encounter

About a week ago, a lone wight entered Gnashing Fang Tribe territory, killing three gnolls on patrol and turning them into mindless servants. With the help of its newly created spawn, the creature took control of the room.

The powerful wight and its three spawn haunt this room. The creatures are causing major problems to the Gnashing Fang Tribe. Most of its warriors dare not face these horrors, fearing that they, like their former comrades, might be turned into mindless undead servants. Because of this, PCs who destroy these undead creatures and tell the gnolls about their deed will benefit from Advantage on their Charisma (Persuasion) checks while dealing with any member of the Gnashing Fang Tribe.

**Encounter Condition:** Desecration 2 or Unhallowed, Distracting Visions

### Tactics

The four wights attack anyone entering their new domain. These fiends do not wield any weapons in combat, preferring to close into melee as soon as possible.

### Treasure

The original wight wears a tarnished silver chain (worth 10 gp if cleaned) upon which hangs an ivory amulet carved to look like the face of a hawk. This item is worth only 10 gp, but could be sold to historians or sages for 200 gp.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the wight spawn's damage by 1 die. To decrease the challenge, remove two wights.

## C32. WESTERN GNOLL MUSTERING ROOM

This large hall contains three mounds of crushed rock. This refuse is lined upon the southern wall, forming six-ft-high piles. It is obvious by the state of disrepair of the ceiling as well as the east and south walls that the rubble was once part of the walls and ceilings of this room. The door in the middle of the north wall is wide open, revealing the dark and narrow corridor beyond.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

### Encounter

It is obvious that this room suffered some sort of damage, but whether it was caused by a minor cave-in or a great battle is difficult to say. Though the southern wall, eastern wall, and ceiling are uneven, the stone of these surfaces looks identical to that of the other walls and floor, which is relatively smooth and worn.

Before the wights took over Room C31, this area was used as a mustering place for the gnolls of the Gnashing Fang Tribe and, with the exception of the regular patrol passing through the chamber, it remained mostly empty the rest of the time. Currently, a cunning gnoll ranger guards the place.

Verk'nek, a respected gnoll ranger and loyal lieutenant, took it upon himself to set up a permanent vigil in this hall. Fearing the wights in Room C31 might come deeper into Gnashing Fang territory, Verk'nek hides behind broken stones in the southeast corner. He remains hidden and silent when patrols of Gnashing Fang warriors pass through the hall or if his compatriots escort the PCs to Gahrr'k.

If the PCs enter unescorted, Verk'nek remains hidden but demands in a clear voice that the PCs identify themselves and their business in Gnashing Fang territory. Verk'nek's voice is loud and clear, alerting gnolls in Room C31 that succeed at a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. Four gnolls enter the hall 1d3 rounds later, while the other warns the gnolls in Room C35, who arrive 1d3 rounds after the group from Room C31 arrives.

Unless provoked, Verk'nek does not engage the PCs. Like most members of his tribe, he prefers diplomacy. Verk'nek's most immediate concerns are the wights. If he knows the PCs destroyed the creatures, his attitude shifts to friendly and he reveals himself. Otherwise, he remains hidden and waits for his tribemates to join him.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush, Cover, Hazardous Footing 16

### Tactics

In battle, Verk'nek remains mostly hidden behind rubble, which grants him cover. He shoots arrows, targeting the more highly armored PCs first, until forced into melee. To reach Verk'nek, the PCs must maneuver around the rubble in the eastern portion of the southern wall.

### Treasure

The large quiver Verk'nek carries holds 40 arrows and is made of boiled leather and decorated with a multitude of tribal designs, each more intricate than the next. Because of its artistic value, it is worth five times the value of other items of its kind to most people, and up to ten times that amount to any gnoll.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, give Verk'nek 2 potions of invisibility and +5 damage on ranged attacks. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, reduce his hit points by 20.

## C33. FIRST GUARDROOM

Both doors to this room are open.

Eight long bunks are lined up on the walls of this chamber, taking up most of the southwestern and northeastern corners. There is a low wooden table with several stools in the middle of the room, as well as simple weapon racks near both entrances. These racks contain a variety of clubs and axes.

**Initial Attitude:** Neutral

### Encounter

This guardroom once housed eight gnolls, but only six gnolls are currently here. While off duty, these warriors remain vigilant. They pay particular attention to any noise coming from Room C29 or Room C32. Like most of their tribesmen, these gnolls are content to speak with PCs wishing to trade information or goods. If the PCs wish to pass through Gnashing Fang tribal grounds, the gnolls insist that they speak to their chieftain Gahr'r'k (and escort them to Room C37).

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Tactics

If fighting ensues, the gnolls will charge the PCs. They target the warriors of the party first and flank them whenever they can.

The gnolls in Room C35 are automatically aware of a fight, and join 1d3 rounds later. Allow the sleeping gnolls in Room C36 a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check. If they hear trouble, these warriors aid their fellow tribesmen in 1d4+2 rounds.

### Treasure

In addition to the weapons they carry, each of these gnolls have 1d4 gp worth of small, uncut semi-precious gemstones and silver coins. Additionally, one wears a decorative bronze armband. Carved upon its surface in simple lines is a mighty bear. This trinket is worth upwards of 15 gp. The weapons racks near the doors holds two clubs, a great club, and three battle axes; all average quality. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Search) check in this room also reveals a dagger with a jewel-embedded hilt worth 100 gp tucked under a crude mattress of a bunk, as well as a pouch containing 41 cp.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two gnolls. To decrease the challenge, remove two gnolls.

## C34. SECOND GUARDROOM

This wide room contains the wooden frames of twelve bunk beds. A thin layer of dust covers the frames and floor of this chamber, suggesting that the place has not been used in a while.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

This room used to house gnolls from the Gnashing Fang Tribe, but none have used it in over two years.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe

### Tactics

While this room is safe to rest in, the constant traffic of gnolls just outside the doors is nerve-racking.

### Treasure

A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a silver coin tucked under the leg of one of the bunk beds.

**Scaling:** N/A
