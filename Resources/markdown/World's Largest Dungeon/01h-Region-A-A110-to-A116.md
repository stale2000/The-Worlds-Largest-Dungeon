# Region A (continued)

## A110. FLOATING SPHERES

The southern door to this Room is locked, requiring a DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to open.

Dozens of fist-sized spheres of swirling color float gently within the room as if moved by an unfelt breeze.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The spheres are actually the physical embodiment of a gateway akin to the one found in Room A103, formed over time as the wards began to fail.

The moment a living creature enters the Room, the colorful spheres begin to float toward the center of the Room. There, they combine with each other and make a larger sphere. It takes four rounds for the spheres to completely form together and create an open gateway with the same properties (including a means to shut it down) as the one in Room A103. On the fifth round, something comes through. This pattern continues, with a new fiendish creature emerging every five rounds. Roll on the following table to determine what steps from the portal.

| D6 | Emergent Creature |
|:---|:------------------|
| 1 | 1d3 fiendish ax beaks |
| 2 | Two fiendish giant bats |
| 3 | One or two fiendish panthers |
| 4 | 1d3+2 howling, fiendish wolves |
| 5 | One or two fiendish wild boars |
| 6 | Roll again. If a six is rolled again, a fiendish owlbear, eyes gleaming red, feathers glinting black and silver, emerges from the gateway; otherwise, two fiendish snake swarms emerge |

The gateway requires the presence of a living creature to open completely, and if the PCs leave the Room before the gateway can fully form, then the spheres break apart and continue floating. Once opened, however, the gateway remains open until closed by the same method that can close the one in Room A103.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, the spheres open the portal after only 3 rounds and continue forming regardless of whether the PCs remain in the Room or not; if the PCs leave before the gate is fully opened, it still opens, and the beast or beasts emerge and hunt the PCs. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, have the gateway disgorge only a single beast before the spheres of the gateway drift apart again.

## A111. TWO PILLARS

Two segmented, nondescript square pillars dominate the area. Large blades jut from the pillars into the space between. Pieces of a thin, broken skeleton lie near the eastern one.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The skeleton has been cut into segments and is beyond identification. It is shorter and thinner than the average human, should the PCs investigate the remains. The skeleton belongs to an unfortunate drow who was killed by the trap. In turn, the trap has failed to reset.

However, the left hand of the drow is intact. Whenever a PC steps on the stone floor, the figures of the hand move as though playing a lyre. Each step taken by the PCs is mirrored by a finger motion. A DC 14 Intelligence (History) check allows a character to identify the tune as that of an old children's song (nursery rhyme if your game world has those). Bards gain advantage on this check.

PCs may realize the hand is magical or holds some value. If they don't break or destroy it, someone may carry the hand in a sack, or a necklace, or wherever. So long as someone is in possession of the hand, it grants a +2 bonus to magic-based saving throws. But the hand will forever twitch and move. It is not strong and cannot hurt anyone, but it never stops moving.

Each pillar reaches to the ceiling, and the segments are a foot apart and so, in turn, are the blades. Each side of the column has a full set of blades, so the only way past the blades is to squeeze between them or to try and clear a space by pushing the blades back into the spaces. The blades are not as sharp as they used to be and are a bit rusty, but gloves are recommended for this task.

Because of the mechanism of the trap, all of the blades move together. It is impossible to push only one blade at a time back into the column. A DC 20 Strength check is required to give enough force on a single blade to rearm the entire mechanism and bring all the blades back into their column. For each additional blade that has force applied to it, the Strength check is reduced by 2; up to four creatures can push on the blades at one time (one blade per column side).

Each creature must succeed at the appropriate Strength check to do their part, so if four are pushing, each must succeed at a DC 12 Strength check for the blades to be reset. Once reset, the trap cannot be sprung again because its triggering mechanism (DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check) is broken. The characters could mend it with a DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, in which case any creature triggering the trap suffers 4d8 slashing damage if they step between the pillars, depressing the pressure pad.

**Encounter Condition:** Spell Resistance

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** An inspection of the bones, now scattered in dangerous parts of the Room, reveals a bracelet next to what might be an arm bone. The bracelet is old, scuffed, and now dented. It may, however, still possess magic. A simple cantrip, like mending, restores this bracelet to its original power, which keeps the wearer warm while he sleeps.

**Scaling:** N/A

## A112. GATEWAY TO FIRE

Drawn on the eastern door to this Room is a Celestial rune. A DC 20 Arcana check by a lawful character (or those who speak celestial) is required to translate the rune. "Purge thy body and thoughts with holy flame."

The door is not locked, but it is difficult to open. Inside the door, piles of wood and furniture have been stacked up to prevent entry, but a DC 15 Strength check opens it. Some light can be seen from under the door crack.

The door on the northern wall is locked on both sides, requiring a DC 18 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to open. Alternatively, an arcane spellcaster may open the door by casting a single fire-based spell. The spell does no damage; the door absorbs it all.

A blast of hot air expels from the room as the door opens. An unnatural light bathes the area. A small rune is written on a bronze plate in the center of the floor.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The rune on the floor is the same as the one on the door. If any lawful or good PC stands on the plate, a gout of fire erupts from the floor (for 1 full minute), but it does not burn. Instead, it cleanses the PC of all poisons, ability score damage, and heals 3d8+3 points of damage.

In addition, so long as the PC is lawful good and remains on the plate for the full minute, he gains temporary (1d20 days) resistance to fire damage.

If a chaotic or evil PC stands on the plate, he suffers 3d8+3 fire damage and gains one level of exhaustion. If a PC is both chaotic AND evil, he suffers this damage twice. This is pure arcane fire that bypasses fire resistance but not spell resistance.

Chaotic good and lawful evil characters gain/lose nothing from these fires.

**Encounter Condition:** Extreme Heat, Hallowed 2, Safe

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## A113. PRISON VAULT ANTECHAMBER

All of the doors to this Room are locked from the inside. The doors to this Room require a DC 18 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to unlock or a DC 20 Strength check to bash open.

This hallway seems to loop back on itself, leading to nowhere. Two doors in the south and one in the north are the only features here.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The hallway surrounds a prison vault (Room A114) that once held a number of middling fiends. The block exhibits no cracks, pores, or pitting and is simply one piece of dark basalt. On the floor on the west side is a bronze plate cut into the shape of a crescent moon. The PCs may not immediately notice it. GMs should decide if they can find it or just accidentally step on it.

The plate is a permanent, invisible dimension door that instantly transports anyone standing on it to Room A114. To his companions, the PC seems to have disappeared suddenly. The effect can be detected with detect magic, revealing an aura of moderate conjuration magic all about the floor.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To decrease the challenge of this encounter, the bronze plate only affects non-lawful or non-good characters. Or both.

## A114. PRISON VAULT

Dead orcs litter the floor of this doorless room. However, no stench exists, and the bodies show no signs of decomposition. After a moment, you realize you are having trouble breathing.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The only way to reach this Room is to step on the invisible dimension door in Room A113. The same can be done from Room A114, but that assumes that one understands the process.

The dimension door effect can transport any creature from Room A113 to Room A114 and vice-versa, provided that the creature, once transported, steps back out of the space before stepping back in. That is, the moment a creature steps onto the dimension door in the hallway, they are transported to the bronze plate inside the vault. They cannot make use of the vault's dimension door effect until they step out of the dimension door space and then step back in.

This should not really be a challenge for PCs as long as they do what comes naturally: explore their surroundings. As long as they inspect the walls or otherwise move off the dimension door space, they are free to use it again. But until they do, they are trapped.

The inside of the vault is airtight, a fact that was not a problem for the extraplanar fiends it held, but is a problem for any PCs trapped in here. There is enough air for one Medium creature for 12 rounds. Reduce the air supply appropriately for every additional creature (by one-half if another Medium creature is there, by one-quarter if a Small creature is there, and so on). Although the PCs should have no trouble finding their way back to Room A113, it is possible that they could die.

> ### GLIGG
>
> Gligg is anything the GM wants it to be. In my own headcanon, Gligg is the quintessence of multiple beings, created in a ritual to defend against some sort of threat. But, in time, it became worse than the threat it was designed to fight. Whatever that was.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Dead orcs litter the floor. A DC 10 Investigation check reveals three silver daggers hidden among their gear. The orcs didn't need Longtail knowing they had a backup plan.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, reduce the amount of air in the Room to 9 rounds. To decrease the challenge, allow the PCs to return to Room A113 1d3 rounds later if they don't step off the bronze plate.

## A115. VAULT

The door to this Room is open.

The floor of this room is a mess. Dozens of broken crates and busted barrels, their contents spilled on the floor, mixed with the moldy remnants of at least as many sacks to completely cover the floor. A blackened scorch mark in the middle of the room indicates a magical fire from a central point. The lingering smell of fire and mold hangs in the air, though it is unclear how long ago all of this destruction happened.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This vault served as a major storage area but like almost everything else in this portion of the dungeon, was abandoned. The destruction was caused by orcs, but it is unclear (upon inspection) if the damage was intentional or not.

Whether by accident or by madness, an orc got a hold of a magical staff, and it exploded on him, killing him and another orc. They were incinerated by the magical fire, which also consumed the staff and all the moldy bags in the room.

From time to time, the voices of the dead orcs can be heard moaning and wailing through the cracks in the walls. Their ghosts lack the power to do anything, but their pain lingers through uneasy sounds.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe

**Tactics:** If the PCs lock the door with a DC 13 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check, the Room is considered Safe, though smelly.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## A116. NOISE

Unless the PCs have already dealt with the fiendish owlbear in Room A100, read the following.

Horrid shrieking echoes from the hallway to the north, followed by another awful sound like animals being ripped apart.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The rampaging owlbear in Room A100 is fighting and killing fiendish darkmantles. The PCs may recognize the noise from the darkmantles, but not the owlbears.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the PCs do nothing, the owlbear will finish off the darkmantles in due course and perhaps start searching in this direction after 10 or 15 minutes.

**Note:** If the owlbear has been dealt with, or the PCs need some action, this is a good place for a random encounter coming from both the south and west.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## AFTERMATH OF REGION A

There are possibly many loose plot threads to this Region, should the PCs not deal with everything here.

- **If Orghar is not killed,** his villainy spreads to Region B. He may or may not take more orcs and kobolds with him. They also may end up killing each other, leaving Orghar all alone in his quest to escape.

- **If the troglodytes are left alone,** their wounded heal, and the group travels north to search for an escape. This probably ends in more deaths, but that's the GM's decision.

- **If Longtail and/or Achsyyx are not killed,** they look for a way out. Achsyyx pretends he has no idea this would happen and returns to loyally serving Longtail. Do they trail the PCs or venture out on their own?

- **The chapel gateway** has a limited number of prisoners inside it. Eventually, a few more owlbears escape and go looking for something to eat.

- **Gligg and the bottle demon** pose significant issues as well. Not to mention the quasits. If any escaped Room A105, they are free to roam Region A and then B or E. The long-term consequences may be too much for the guardians of E who already struggle to reclaim the Region.

- **Let us not forget** that there are two adventurers in Region A who might join the PCs or encounter them again. Do not overlook their use.

- **Or the lizardfolk.** GMs have their hands full...
