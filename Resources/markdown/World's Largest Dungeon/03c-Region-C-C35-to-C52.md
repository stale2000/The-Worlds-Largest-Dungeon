# Region C (continued)

## C35. Third Guardroom

A stone slab dominates the southeast corner of this chamber. The slab is cracked in many places and its surface is covered with crude but colorful graffiti. Several wooden stools have been placed around the painted flat stone "table," and a number of empty jars rest upon it. There are a dozen bunk beds lining the north and west walls, as well as a simple iron rack holding several weapons beside the southern door, which is wide open.

Three gnolls sit in a circle in the middle of the room: one is holding a handful of bones while the others are eagerly looking on. In front of each of the canine-faced humanoids, stacked upon the floor before them, are piles of copper coins.

**Initial Attitude:** Neutral

### Encounter

Three **gnoll warriors** are sitting in a circle in the middle of the room, playing a game of chance. Though their attention is focused on their game, they keep their ears open to any noise coming from Room C29. They suffer **Disadvantage** to any checks made to notice the PCs.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 4

### Tactics

These gnolls are more interested in acquiring copper (or silver!) for use in gambling, rather than fighting. But, if the PCs pose any threat to them, or if they learn that they have harmed any member of their tribe, they grab their weapons and attack them.

In combat, two gnolls stand in the middle of the room, preventing the PCs from reaching their companion, whose task it is to alert the warriors in Rooms C33 and C36, as well as their chieftain in Room C37. This gnoll stays behind his companions and barks loudly. He continues to bark until he is either forced into melee or reinforcements arrive, at which point he joins the fighting.

The gnolls in Room C33 are instantly alerted and arrive 1d3 rounds later. Allow the sleeping warriors in Room C36 a **DC 26 Wisdom (Perception)** check to notice the ruckus. If they are awakened, these gnolls enter this guardroom 1d3 rounds later. Gahrr'k (Room C37) will notice the fighting if he (or anyone else in his throne room) succeeds at a **DC 18 Wisdom (Perception)** check. They then rouse the warriors in Room C36 and arrive within 1d3 rounds.

### Treasure

There is a total of 151 cp lying upon the ground of this chamber. The tokens the gnolls are using for their game are six elaborately carved bones with several designs printed upon them. Though these are mostly useless, a gnoll might pay upwards of 5 gp for them.

The stone tablet is used as both a table and canvas for painting. The jars lying upon it are empty save for a thick layer of dried paint. Most of the images represent animals and magical beasts hunted by bands of gnolls. They are crude and worthless to all but gnolls.

The weapons rack near the southern entrance holds a great-axe, two battle-axes, a warhammer, and a masterwork great club.

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, give each gnoll the **Second Wind Bonus Action** (1/rest: recover 1d10 + 2 hit points). To decrease the challenge, remove one gnoll.

---

## C36. Fourth Guardroom

There are four humanoids in this chamber. These creatures are tall, with their furry bodies and canine-like faces exposed as they slumber upon large bunk beds. Though there are more bunks here than there are inhabitants, twelve beds in all, only nine of these have mattresses and woolen blankets upon them. There is a pair of well-polished great axes resting upon the wall close to the northwestern door.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

### Encounter

This guardroom normally houses nine gnolls, but some are out on patrol. There are four **gnoll warriors** currently sleeping here. If intruding PCs rouse them, they rush out of their beds and ready for battle. Unlike most other members of their tribe, they are prone to attack PCs entering their private chamber uninvited, but PCs who successfully change their initial attitude through the use of a **Charisma (Persuasion)** check might avoid any combat.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Tactics

In battle, these warriors will fight savagely, and flank the more heavily armed and armored foes as often as they can manage.

While in combat, these gnolls utter loud barks to alert the rest of their tribe. Allow the gnolls in Room C35 and the chieftain in Room C37 a **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)** check to notice the ruckus. If they do, these gnolls join the fight in 1d3 rounds. Similarly, allow the gnolls in Room C33 a **DC 18 Wisdom (Perception)** check to hear the commotion. These warriors join the battle 1d4+2 rounds after they are made aware of it.

### Treasure

Each gnoll in this chamber carries 1d4 gp worth of gemstones and assorted coins. One of them also has a masterwork warhammer, which he keeps at the foot of his bed. The two great axes lying upon the north wall near the western door are sound weapons of ordinary quality.

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, give each gnoll the **Second Wind Bonus Action** (1/rest: recover 1d10 + 2 hit points). To decrease the challenge, remove one gnoll.

---

## C37. Gahrr'k's Chamber

A wide black pelt covers a good portion of the floor in the middle of this large chamber. A bed and an iron chest lie in the northeast corner of the room, while a narrow wooden desk takes up most of the northwest corner. A stone chair that resembles a kingly throne sits upon the floor. In the middle of the northern wall, the flames from several torches set amidst this wall burn, bathing the room in a warm golden light.

Upon the throne-like chair is a large figure with the features of a wild dog, with one ear missing, replaced by scar tissue. The fur of the humanoid, dark and disheveled, is visible where its burgundy clothing and polished scale mail armor do not cover it. The fiery eyes of the inhuman face burn brightly. Another male humanoid bearing similar features stands near the creature on the throne. Three other gnoll warriors are standing by the southern door, as if awaiting orders.

**Initial Attitude:** Neutral

### Encounter

**Gahrr'k One-Ear**, the powerful, savage gnoll chieftain of the Gnashing Fang Tribe, lives in this room. Gahrr'k is a fierce and proven warrior who won the respect of his peers long ago. He rules the Gnashing Fang Tribe and his ambitions include the invasion of the goblin tribe to the west, for the war he waged against the Goblin King caused his tribe to suffer terrible losses. Though Gahrr'k realizes this is a long-term endeavor, he continues to dream of the day when the territory of Argliss' the Goblin King falls under his control.

If members of his tribe escorted the PCs to Gahrr'k's chamber and they offered no resistance or threat to his people, the chieftain is eager to talk and negotiate with them. Gahrr'k is more than willing to trade information and safe passage through the territory controlled by the Gnashing Fang Tribe in exchange for weapons and other valuables. He is most interested in hearing what the PCs have learned about the other regions of the dungeon, especially if they have news of Argliss or his lowly goblins. If the PCs inform Gahrr'k that they disposed of the goblin king, the chieftain is much more willing to help the PCs.

A cunning gnoll, Gahrr'k negotiates with the PCs, hoping to gain their assistance in getting rid of the hill giant family to the east, as well as the goblins to the west (should they still remain). If the PCs show no interest in any of these endeavors but are respectful of Gahrr'k and his people, the chieftain will agree to grant them safe passage through his domain. If the PCs are interested in slaughtering the goblins or routing out the giants, Gahrr'k offers all the gold he possesses (kept in his chest) in exchange for the head of the three giants or the goblin king. The gnolls do not actively help the PCs in such a mission, but they offer them aid with menial tasks and a safe haven.

When questioned on the wizard Arum, Gahrr'k reveals he has never seen him and suspects he is either dead or long ago left the dungeon. He has explored most of the wizard's domain, and even used portions of it in the past to house the warriors of his tribe. Though he abandoned any claims he had on the wizards territory long ago (because of the many traps found therein, but also because of the diminished number of warriors under his control), Gahrr'k occasionally sends scouts to investigate. As far as he knows, no one lives there.

If asked about the goblin king, Gahrr'k explains that the goblins have long been a thorn in his side, but that in recent years the fighting between Argliss' people and the Gnashing Fang Tribe almost ceased mainly because Gahrr'k does not have the manpower to wage a constant war against the little vermin.

If the PCs barter with Gahrr'k, he offers any of the weapons stored in Room C30 in exchange for axes, clubs, hammers, bows and arrows, crossbows and bolts, ropes, or oil flasks. Gahrr'k One-Ear has a small jar of **stone salve** with two applications left, enough to restore two people back to flesh. He is willing to trade it for weapons or various other goods valued at 8,000 gp or more. Gold coins alone cannot account for more than half of this deal, however, as coins are nearly worthless down here. The chieftain has little else to offer, but listens to any offers of diplomacy the PCs make.

If the PCs barge into his chamber unescorted, or if the chieftain learns they killed members of his tribe, he picks up his enchanted great club and attacks. His lieutenant and three bodyguards react instantly.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Tactics

In combat, Gahrr'k lets his men handle the PCs while he drinks a draught of his **potion of speed**. The following round, he attacks heavily armored PCs first. Meanwhile, the bodyguards engage the PCs in melee and the lieutenant attacks the spellcasters.

These warriors bark loudly in combat, and their cries alarm the gnolls in Room C33 if they make a **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)** check, as well as those in Rooms C33 and C36 if they succeed at a **DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)** check. These warriors come to aid their chieftain 1d4+2 rounds after they have been made aware of the ruckus.

### Treasure

In addition to the weapons they carry, the three gnolls have 1d4 gp worth of small jewels and coins. The pelts upon the chieftain's bed are in good condition and could be sold for upwards of 30 gp. Gahrr'k carries a variety of magical items and a small silvery key hangs from a golden chain (worth 35 gp) at his neck. This key unlocks the chest at the foot of the bed.

Gahrr'k's chest is made of iron. It is locked and requires a **DC 22 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)** check or the chieftain's key to unlock. Inside, there is a total of 754 gp and 1,312 sp. On top of the coins there is a green velvet pouch containing three small diamonds (each worth 750 gp), a tarnished silvered dagger, and an empty ivory scroll case. When closed, this scroll case can be submerged in water without risk of damaging any parchment held inside. This object is worth 20 times the value of similar items of its kind.

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a **fiendish darkmantle** (Region A), that Gahrr'k befriended with wild empathy. To decrease the challenge, remove two gnolls or the lieutenant from the encounter.

---

## C38. Cellblock

*The door on the eastern wall is locked and requires the jailer's key (see below) or a successful DC 22 Dexterity check. It can be unlocked from either side, but PCs coming from the east automatically alert the inhabitants.*

This wide hallway contains four wooden doors with small windows and iron bars upon both the north and south walls. These eight doors open into what appears to be eight small cells, but only one of them is closed. There are two double doors made of wood and reinforced with iron plates in the center of the north wall. Similar doors appear in the middle of the south wall.

In the center of the room is a long table made out of wood with six comfortable-looking wooden chairs set around it. There are four gnolls in this room. Three of them hold great axes and shields while a third is armed with an axe and a whip.

**Initial Attitude:** Neutral

### Encounter

Five of the cell doors have no locks and there is no obvious way to lock them. The other cells have workable locking mechanisms, but only the door to the southeastern cell is closed and locked. Inside this cell is the recently expired body of a goblin. The creature's skin is taut and scarred with countless whip marks. It probably died from both malnutrition and abuse.

**Ramk'mva**, the gnoll jailer, and three gnolls are in charge of securing the prison, as well as protecting the borders of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. Ramk'mva is an old and cunning gnoll who earned the trust of his chieftain long ago. He is content with his position within the tribe and happy to oversee the prisons, especially since so little needs to be done.

To help control their territory, the gnolls keep the eastern door locked at all times. Ramk'mva holds the key, but does not let anyone through, unless Gahrr'k orders it.

If the PCs enter this room from the east, they must first pick the lock of the door. The gnolls stand ready to face them in battle when they enter, but Ramk'mva is willing to talk. He informs them that this marks the boundary of the Gnashing Fang tribal grounds and has his warriors escort the PCs to Gahrr'k (in Room C37). If the PCs refuse, but agree not to disturb the tribe, Ramk'mva is happy to bid them goodbye. If the PCs threaten or attack the gnolls, combat ensues.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Tactics

If combat is inevitable, Ramk'mva lets the three warriors handle the PCs while he makes his way to Rooms C36, C35, and C37 to alert the other gnolls of intruders. Though he does not wish to fight, if cornered or unable to escape, Ramk'mva fights until defeated. In combat, he uses both his battle-axe and whip to disarm the PCs every chance he gets. Meanwhile, the three warriors engage in melee, targeting the strongest first, using gang tactics whenever possible.

If fighting breaks out in the cellblock, allow the gnolls in Rooms C33, C34, C36, and C37 a **DC 22 Wisdom (Perception)** check to hear the sound of battle. If they do, they come to aid their fellow tribesmen 1d4+2 rounds thereafter.

### Treasure

The cells hold nothing valuable, but each of the warriors in this room carries a pouch with 1d4 gp worth of small gemstones, silver coins, and copper pieces. Ramk'mva the Jailer has a ring of keys that unlocks the eastern door as well as each of the three cells that still have a working locking mechanism upon their doors. One of the keys he carries also unlocks the doors of Rooms C40, C41, and C42, as well as the double doors south of Room C40.

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, double the number of gnoll warriors present and give Ramk'mva **Sneak Attack (4d6)**. To decrease the challenge, remove three gnolls.

## C39. Lieutenant's Quarters

The doors opening into this chamber are unlocked.

Inside the small room, cast in the heavy shadows, are two narrow but comfortable-looking beds. The beds are covered with thick animal pelts.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

This room is the quarters of two powerful members of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. Verk'nek holds the title of lieutenant and guards' Room C32, and Nirk'na is the chieftain's right-hand man (in Room C37). Both are feared by the warriors of the tribe and trust Ramk'mva (Room C38) to protect their private chamber.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Tactics

N/A

### Treasure

A successful **DC 13 Wisdom (Perception)** check made in this room uncovers a small wooden chest hidden under one of the beds. This chest is unlocked and holds 37 sp, a large chunk of golden amber (worth 95 gp), and a bronze bracelet large enough to cover the entire forearm of a medium sized creature (worth 50 gp).

### Scaling

N/A

## C40. Secured Area

*All the doors to this room are locked. Ramk'mva (Room C38) possesses the only key. A DC 23 Dexterity check is required to unlock any of the doors.*

This hallway is cast in total darkness. Upon closer examination, the floor here has several scuff marks imprinted on the cold stone. The floor, however, is covered with a thick blanket of dust, suggesting that although there once was heavy traffic in this area, this hall has not been entered in years.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

This room and the locked double doors leading into it serve as a safety buffer between the cellblock (Room C38) and the jail cells holding dangerous creatures to the south (Rooms C41 and C42).

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

## C41. Rust Monster's Prison Cell

*The doors of this cell are made of heavy oak and several wooden beams nailed into the stone wall block it. Anyone wishing to enter this room must first remove the wooden planks that block the entrance. Each of the five beams can be pulled with a successful DC 20 Strength check. This action reveals a rusted-but-functional iron lock mechanism. A DC 19 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check is required to unlock the door unless the PCs have acquired its key from Room C38. The PC opening this door must succeed at a DC 20 Dexterity check. Failing this check results in the door falling off its hinges, which are completely eaten by rust.*

Inside this large, shadowy chamber is an insect-like creature with four squat legs, long antennae, and a squat body protected by an odd hide. The walls of this chamber are made of stone, and, like most of the dungeon, seem to have been carved out from the sheer bedrock. These walls, however, have turned into a deep rust-colored shade, as if every speck of metal within them had rusted.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

### Encounter

A **Large rust monster** is locked in this room. The creature has been feeding on the tiny residues of iron found within the walls of its prison. It is maddened and hateful, standing ready to charge anyone fool enough to unlock its cell.

While the room itself is not haunted, remaining in it for more than 24 hours can have damaging effects. Soft, almost imperceptible echoes bounce from the walls of the room. As time goes on, these echoes become harder and harder to block out, until the creature inside begins to think the sounds are part of their own mind. Anyone failing a **Wisdom save (DC 15 + 1 per previous save)** suffers 1 point of Wisdom damage, which takes twice as long to heal as normal. This save must be repeated every two hours beyond the first 24.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 4, Fearless, [Safe]

### Tactics

The monster has become mindless as a result of being trapped in the cell too long. It attacks the closest PC in metal armor and fights ferociously. It continues to attack the PC until his armor is beyond repair, then targets weapons, before moving on to the next PC. While rust monsters themselves do not normally act like trapped animals, this one has suffered too much from its lengthy imprisonment.

### Treasure

Anything of value is now a pile of rust, although there is a masterwork cudgel on the floor in the corner of the room. Allow the PCs to dig through the piles all they like, however.

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one rust monster. To decrease the challenge, have the rust monster wounded (-30 hit points).

---

## C42. Imprisoned Ochre Jelly

*The doors leading into this cell are locked. The key to unlock them can be found in Room C38. Otherwise, a DC 15 Dexterity check is enough to bypass the lock.*

This chamber contains a mass of yellowish ooze. The strange entity is oddly shaped and, in the darkness, moves slowly. Its slick surface undulates, reflecting light against the black of the dungeon walls.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

### Encounter

An **ochre jelly** is trapped in this cell. The creature has been imprisoned here for decades, and not even the gnolls could say who is responsible for imprisoning it here. Its corrosive jelly eats away at the stonework, turning it black.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), Fearless, [Safe]

### Tactics

As soon as anyone opens the door, the ochre jelly strikes the first target that gets in its way. In combat, it grapples and constricts its prey. If a PC is stunned, it moves on to the next, so it can escape without fear of reprisal. If the PCs leave it a way out, it moves into the corridor outside the door. It does not fight unless it has to.

### Treasure

Any treasure that may have existed is slag now.

---

## C43-C59. The Wizard's Domain

Following the brutal deaths of the knights and paladins of Merunda, and the destruction of his former laboratory (see Rooms C20 and C21), the wizard Arum established a home for himself in this section of the dungeon. The wizard is responsible for the accidental liberation of the demon Falortuligo (Room C21). Though Arum left long ago, this section is still considered his, as few creatures dare venture here and most inhabitants assume he is still around.

GMs wishing to complete the saga of Arum can place his corpse in one of the rooms where he committed suicide, somewhere in Region O. Alternatively, place a wraith, ghost, lich, or wight somewhere in this region to represent his remorse and eternal damnation manifested into evil.

### Random Encounters

## C43. Empty Storeroom

*As the PCs approach this door, allow them each a DC 19 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear moaning from inside the room.*

Most of the stone floor of this room is hidden under thick wooden crates. Though these crates are sturdy, and their wood is mostly undamaged, many of them are opened and empty. The walls are blackened by age and magic. In the darkness of a nearby comer, the spiny silhouette of a beast hunkers down behind a crate.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

### Encounter

Like many rooms in this section, this area was once claimed as part of the Gnashing Fang Tribe's territory. Over the last decade, the tribe gradually relinquished control of this section, which was once used to store goods. Now millipedes and other bugs hunt through the cracks of the stonework.

However, before the gnolls left, they mercilessly chained a **howler** to the wall, leaving it for dead. It has refused to go quietly and moans pitifully. However, the room's magical nature absorbs a great deal of the sound and muffles it into white noise.

The room absorbs light and sound and reduces their effective range to half.

**Encounter Condition:** Cover, Echoes 5, Fearless

### Tactics

Allow the howler a **Wisdom (Perception)** check to notice the PCs enter the room. If successful, it barks loudly, targeting everyone with its Mind-Breaking Howl. The howler cannot move, but pitifully yanks at its own chain in an attempt to free itself. It has no choice, but to fight to the death.

If the PCs try to befriend the creature rather than kill it, allow **Wisdom (Animal Handling)**, but since the beast is unnatural they suffer **Disadvantage**.

### Treasure

Though most of the crates are empty, some contain gear that could be helpful. The PCs find three tinder-twigs, a flask of antitoxin, seven empty glass vials, a large clay jug, a bullseye lantern, three pints of oil, two rusty miner's picks, 200 ft. of hempen rope, and a heavy sledge.

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this trap, add two vargouille which torment the howler, but turn their attention to the PCs when they enter. To reduce the challenge, have the howler asleep when they arrive.

---

## C44. Modified Chamber

This oddly shaped chamber is vacant. The walls here are smooth and undamaged. A closer look at the floor reveals that its surface is spotless, save for a narrow space, some 10-ft. square, linking the only door with the southern wall. The skeletal remains of two goblins and one gnoll rest in one corner.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

This room was once a tiny cell, but the wizard Arum changed the layout with powerful magic after settling in. Though no one knows what he intended, those with expertise with stone or masonry, as well as those accustomed to the geography of the dungeon, can tell that something is not quite right with the walls of this room.

Aside from the 10-ft.-wide portion of the south wall directly in front of the doorway and a narrow frame surrounding the door on the north wall, the walls of this room have a different texture than the other walls in the dungeon. Though most of the walls in this region have the same stone surface, these are smoother, paler, and (most importantly) show no sign of wear. A successful **DC 16 Intelligence** check confirms that the stone used here is not only different, but also that it is strange to find it in the dungeon. A successful **DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana)** check reveals the entire room was shaped with magic.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 1, Hallowed 1, [Positive Energy], Safe

### Tactics

N/A

### Treasure

Buried within the walls are several **wands of sleep**, that Arum built into this chamber. The wands were corrupted by the chaotic magic of the region, and constantly target the occupants with a desire for restful sleep. The walls radiate strong Abjuration and Enchantment.

PCs spending more than 5 hours in this room, feel a calming peace come over them. The energy is soothing and beckons the PCs to stay a while. After 5 hours, however, they lose the will to leave. PCs trying to leave, must succeed at **DC 16 Wisdom saves**, or rest in a quiet corner for another 8 hours. This is a very good rest for the PC but it is hard to resist. While they heal at twice the normal rate in this room, a **DC 16 Wisdom save** is required every morning to summon the will to leave.

The key to escaping this perpetual trap is for PCs that can leave, to either carry out the ones who won't leave or sleep in another room, until the "trapped" PCs gain the will to escape. PCs sleeping in the hall (waiting for their comrades) are subject to random encounters (once every two hours), while the occupants of the room are not.

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the slumber take effect in 2 hours rather than 5 hours. To decrease the challenge, the PCs only need to sleep one day here and can leave freely the next day.

## C45. False Treasure Room

The floor of this small room is littered with gold pieces, though these fail to hide the dusty floor beneath. In the center of the chamber is a simple stone altar upon which a long double-edged sword lies. The sword is fashioned from a silver alloy that shines brilliantly when light is cast upon it.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

This room was converted into a false treasure chamber by the wizard Arum. A successful **DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)** check is required to unlock the only door leading into this room, and the key that once served that purpose was destroyed long ago.

Anyone touching the sword or the altar triggers the trap, which was created by Arum years ago.

**Magic Missile Trap.** *Detect:* DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana); *Disable:* DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters in a 120-ft. range suffer 4d4+1 force damage each.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Tactics

N/A

### Treasure

The longsword is endowed with a permanent magic aura, making it appear as a **+3 vorpal longsword**. In truth, it's a **-2 cursed longsword**. The gold scattered upon the floor is real and totals 327 gp.

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the damage by 2d4. To decrease the challenge, the trap triggers only once.

---

## C46. Trapped Doorways

The corridor leading south ends in a strange intersection. Upon the eastern wall is a wide doorway opening into a dark room. To the west and south, short hallways lead to closed doors, each with a locking mechanism set above their knob.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

The two doors on the southern end of this corridor are traps. The first of these doors is real, but the second is fake. It is stuck inside the stone wall and cannot be opened by any means. Both doors have a complex locking mechanism set upon them. A successful **DC 18 Dexterity** check is required to unlock either of them.

The first door is rigged with a crushing despair trap, which is triggered as soon as any creature passes through the doorway.

**Crushing Despair Trap.** *Detect:* DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana); *Disable:* DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters in a 20-ft. square area must make a DC 15 Charisma save or suffer from bane for 1 hour.

The second door, which is impossible to open – though its lock can be picked normally – is trapped as well and triggers when anyone touches it.

**Acid Fog Trap.** *Detect:* DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana); *Disable:* DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters in a 20-ft. square area must make a DC 15 Dexterity save for half damage or suffer 3d6 acid damage.

Though no creatures live in this room, the vargouilles in Room C47 are alerted when the trap is sprung.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air, [Smoke]

### Tactics

N/A

N/A

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, add cloudkill to the crushing despair trap and have the vargouilles (room C47) ambush the PCs as they exit. To decrease the challenge, remove the acid fog trap.

---

## C47. Rogue Vargouilles

*Both doorways leading into this chamber are wide open. Though these once held doors, they were taken out long ago. A closer inspection of these archways reveals the rusted remains of strong iron hinges.*

*If the PCs fought the chained howler (Room C43), the vargouilles cannot be surprised.*

Beyond the empty archway is a large chamber. The room is dark and an undisturbed blanket of dust covers the floor. The stone floor is scuffed and marked under the dust, suggesting that traffic was once common here.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

### Encounter

Four **vargouilles** hide in this chamber. These creatures recently ventured into the wizard's domain and decided to turn this room into their new home. They are content to remain in the darkness, but attack anyone entering what they now consider their lair.

If the PCs use a light source, the vargouilles automatically notice them. Otherwise, allow the vargouilles the appropriate **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. They remain hidden, waiting for the PCs to enter. If it takes more than 10 rounds for the PCs to reach their lair after they were spotted, the vargouilles come after them instead.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), Concealment, Fear 14, Fearless, Unhallowed

### Tactics

The vargouilles use shriek as soon as they reveal themselves (or the moment they are spotted). They close in melee, biting their foes. Though they do not necessarily fight in unison, these creatures are savage and fight to the death. They target the weakest opponents first, and do not hesitate to attack the wounded.

## C48. Former Great Hall

Torches set amidst heavy bronze sconces are ablaze, their light revealing a massive stone table that dominates the center of this large hall. Broken wooden stools and a rotten tapestry (now piled in the corner of the room) complete the collection of furniture, which is covered with dust. Three corridors lead into this place, but the one opening in the middle of the eastern wall is blocked.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

The Gnashing Fang Tribe previously used this room as a meeting hall. Though they have long abandoned the place, it remains unchanged.

This great hall is empty and has not seen use in years. Only the vargouilles in Room C47 have passed through it in recent months. The stone table in the center of the place is solid and its surface is scarred with various claw marks. These were designed by the gnolls that once lived here, but mean nothing special.

The corridor leading east ends abruptly. When Arum defeated the hill giant in Room C97, he created a permanent **wall of stone** here to block the access. A successful **DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana)** check made here reveals that this portion of the wall is indeed a wall of stone. It is next to impossible to dig through this wall.

There is a barely noticeable irregularity in the center of the western wall. PCs succeeding at a **DC 22 Wisdom (Perception)** check notices narrow grooves upon the stone surface, suggesting that a portion of the wall is actually a hidden panel. A close examination of this panel reveals a tiny hole in its center. The device is clearly some sort of keyhole, but its key is yet undiscovered (by the PCs). A successful **DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)** check is enough to unlock the mechanism. Upon success, the panel sinks into the floor, revealing Room C51 beyond. The secret door closes itself one minute after it is opened.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Treasure

PCs observing the degraded tapestry discern faded colors, but no particular image comes to mind based on the design. The item is worthless. The torches have **continual flame** cast on them.

## C49. Former Barracks

*Both doors to this room are locked and require a successful DC 24 Dexterity check to open.*

Eerie lights and dancing shadows project upon the walls, distracting you. The room beyond the door is in disarray, as if ransacked. Splintered wooden bunk-bed frames line the southern and eastern walls. Though no mattresses or bed sheets cover them now, they could once sleep twelve, and if suitable bedding could be acquired, they could still be used.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

### Encounter

This room once housed warriors of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. Over the years, the tribe suffered great losses and eventually abandoned the place. Before fleeing, they used this place to trap a feral **ghoul** they were unable to kill. The beast has been captive for many months and seeks to destroy anyone who enters (including the PCs).

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush, Fearless, [Safe]

### Tactics

The ghoul is fearless and stronger than most of its kind. It waits above the door and descends on the last person to enter. The PCs need a **DC 25 Wisdom (Perception)** check to notice it as they enter and gain **Advantage** only if they are looking straight up as they enter (the monster knows exactly where to hide in the room's shadow).

During the first round, the ghoul takes full advantage of its abilities, attacking its victim with two claws, one bite, and its special rake attack. The ghoul's claws are razor-sharp from many years of scratching and sharpening upon the dungeon walls, and its critical threat range is increased accordingly.

### Treasure

A torch imbued with **continual flame** was left behind, perhaps to torment the nocturnal ghoul. The torch was broken into many pieces, but the continual flame still casts light from a single 3-in. piece of wood. A successful **DC 16 Wisdom (Perception)** check discovers a gold earring (worth 25 gp) tucked between one of the bunks and the wall.

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, allow the ghoul to sneak attack the first PC for +3d6 damage. In addition, at the end of the first round, have the PCs make a **DC 14 Wisdom saving throw** or be Frightened. To decrease the challenge, have the ghoul be surprised by the PCs.

## C50. The Tomb of Narr'krr

*Both doors leading into this chamber were sealed with thick wax, applied to the inside of the door frames long ago. Because of the wax, a successful DC 17 Strength check is required to open each door.*

The doors opening into this chamber are extremely hard to push open, but once done, a stench emanates from within. Inside this large room is a simple wooden desk, a large stool, an iron chest, and a wide bed. Upon the bed is the source of the powerful smell: a tall humanoid skeleton with bits of rotted flesh sticking to the yellowed bones. The corpse is dressed in rotten clothing, but a large gold torc hangs from a chain upon its neck.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

Narr'krr, a powerful gnoll warrior, used this chamber as his private abode and office. Narr'krr suffered a crippling injury six years ago and, shortly after his death, was laid to rest in this chamber, and both doors were sealed.

With a successful **DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine)** check or **DC 11 Intelligence (Nature)** check, PCs observing the corpse can determine this creature was a particularly large gnoll.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Tactics

N/A

### Treasure

Upon the desk are a handful of blank scroll pages, which are dried and yellowed but still usable, and an empty vial of ink. The chest here contains rotted clothing and a **+1 hand axe**. Lastly, Narr'krr spent his last few months studying some arcane notes and while he never understood them, he hid them away in a cache under the table. A successful **DC 22 Wisdom (Perception)** check reveals a small bone scroll case with an arcane scroll in it. The scroll contains the spells **gaseous form**, **illusionary script**, **suggestion**, and **water breathing**.

PCs searching the body automatically find a gold torc set upon a heavy chain. The chain is made of tarnished bronze rings and worth a mere 3 gp. The surface of its crescent shape is engraved with multiple tribal designs. It is worth 250 gp in civilization, but at least twice as much to a gnoll. Members of the Howling Fang Tribe (that never ventured into the dungeon), and most Gnashing Fang gnolls would pay up to 1,000 gp for such a treasure, as it is an heirloom of their people.

If the PCs attempt a trade with Gahrr'k (Room C37), a **DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion)** check is necessary to get both stone salves for the heirloom. He easily trades one for it.

## C51. Wizard's Laboratory

*To enter this room, the PCs must find the secret panel in Room C48. This panel resets itself one minute after being opened. PCs caught on this side instantly notice the irregularity in the center of the eastern wall, provided they know where to look. From this side, a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check is enough to notice the narrow grooves upon the stone surface as well as the tiny keyhole in the middle of the panel. A successful DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check is still required to unlock the mechanism, but the proper key rests on the table in this chamber.*

A low table lies in the middle of this chamber, which is illuminated by the flames of four torches, each set into wall sconces in the corners. Upon the table are a variety of clay flasks, glass vials, and pots, some of which contain liquids. Beside these is a minuscule silvery rod.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

Shortly after the escape of the demon in room C21 and the terrible deaths of the knights of Merunda, Arum discovered this hidden chamber and built another laboratory here. Judging by the dust covering everything in this room, it's clear it hasn't been used in some time.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Treasure

The narrow rod upon the table is the key that unlocks the secret panel leading into this room. The various flasks contain three **potions of giant strength**, five **potions of speed**, two **potions of resistance (fire)**, and two **potions of cure disease**. In addition to these items, there are seven empty glass vials, three clay jars, two small cooking pans made of blackened iron, an alembic, and a host of crude alchemical tools. The four torches have **continual flame** cast on them.

## C52. Wizard's Study

Like the laboratory, the burning flames of torches set into each corner illuminate this room. A comfortable-looking chair rests at the foot of the southern wall, facing the chamber's only door. Beside the chair is a small wooden table, on which is placed a thick leather-bound volume, two vials of black ink, and an ink pen.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

### Encounter

Arum used this chamber to meditate and conduct magical research. Like most rooms in this part of the dungeon, the furniture is blanketed with dust. A closer look suggests that no creature has entered this place in years.

### Treasure

The most significant treasure in this chamber is an unmarked journal. Written in Draconic (the first half) and scrawled in Common (the second half), the journal reveals a portion of the wizard's account.

While trying to gain insight into his future, Arum was contacted by a divine entity known as **Merunda**, a minor goddess of the oceans, travel, and vigilance. The deity told him to come to the dungeon prison and wait for others to arrive.

Shortly after Arum arrived, he performed experiments to discover why extraplanar travel was impossible here. After successfully opening a tiny extraplanar rift, an angel confronted him (mentally), forbidding him from ever attempting such an experiment again. Arum goes on to explain that the angel was imprisoned with a powerful demon in this area, and that it would not allow anyone to release this evil. The journal ends shortly after the arrival of three paladins of Merunda.

After several blank pages, the writing continues, only the handwriting is more chaotic and the verbiage more difficult to decipher. PCs succeeding at a **DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation)** check can discover the following information.

Arum (now referring to himself in the third person) communicated with what he believed was an angel trapped within the dungeon to learn how to make his forge more efficient. Following the angel's advice, the wizard placed powerful wards to reflect the heat generated by his forge back to it. What the wizard had not realized, however, was that the wards he placed upon the wall would facilitate Ash's freedom. It was indeed the cunning demon that had communicated with him, not an angel. The details of the account are vague, but the text is filled with remorse. The author blames himself for Ash's escape, which ultimately led to the Paladins' fall.

The two vials contain dried and unusable ink, but the ink pen is still in good shape. The four torches have **continual flame** cast on them.
