# Region C

## The Final Option

This entire region was designed specifically to hold a powerful demon, Falortuligo (Room C21). Though this cell was of primordial importance, several groups of minor demons and lesser undead were also held prisoner here. When the cataclysm that shook the entire dungeon struck, most of these foul minions escaped, but the special cell in which the mighty demon lord was imprisoned remained completely intact. Over the years, several groups of explorers and settlers came to the region, but the great demon's cell remained undisturbed and undiscovered.

Approximately 50 years ago, the last remnants of the Order of Myruun (an ancient minor goddess of the oceans, travel, and vigilance) were summoned here for mysterious reasons then only known to Myruun. It is still possible to piece together much of what happened during their stay, for the remnants and records of the forgotten Paladins of Myruun can be found buried here. Most of these fragments of information are well hidden, but clues are scattered throughout the region.

Perhaps sensing the weakening of the prison wards, Myruun instructed her remaining worshippers and servants to assemble in this region of the dungeon. No one knew why they were brought together in the bowels of this forgotten place, save the fact that they would be instrumental in turning the tide at some undetermined moment. Most were paladins and priests of some acclaim. Only the wizard Arum arrived without being summoned, claiming he dreamt of his "destiny" and had to come here. When the final pilgrim arrived, 41 men and women occupied the garrison established in Rooms C1-C19. It was widely believed by those 41 inhabitants that they were the last in the line of the tradition of worshiping Myruun, and so they waited without further explanation.

When the prison vault of Falortuligo (Room C21) was broken open, Myruun revealed her plans to her minions. With the exception of Arum, they were asked to give their lives to fight the powerful demon that had escaped. Arum's perspective of the battle is recorded in only one place. It is the sole account of the last battle and subsequent demise of the servants of Myruun, as Arum was its only living witness. The wizard's account can be found in Room C64 (see the Path of the Righteous section for further details).

It is important to note that ethereal travel is possible in the area surrounding Room C4, due to a powerful experiment performed by the wizard Arum a few months after he arrived. The boundaries of this ethereal pocket are roughly 100 ft. in every direction from the altar in Room C4 and are clearly visible if the subject can see objects in the ethereal plane.

## C1-C19: Forgotten Paladin Garrison

When the knights, paladins, and priests of Myruun were summoned to the dungeon, they established a base of operation for their garrison in Rooms C1 though C19. Evidence of their passage is obvious throughout the area.

Myruun (a minor goddess of the oceans, travel, and vigilance) had summoned her last worshippers to this region of the vast dungeon prison. At the time, those who answered the goddess' call did not know what was expected of them. They lived here for more than three years, until one day their purpose was finally revealed to them, just moments before the vile demon imprisoned in Room C21 broke free. To the last, the servants of the goddess Myruun willingly gave up their lives to aid an angel in destroying the demon called Falortuligo. None but the wizard Arum (who was with the devout, but was not one of them) knew of their sacrifice: were it not for the brave men and women of the Order of Myruun, the demon would have unleashed its wrath upon the world.

### C1: Forgotten Guardroom

> A broken cable lies amidst the crumbled and disheveled remains of this otherwise empty room. Oddly enough, this room is not saturated with the same dust as others in the area. It is eerily quiet and the walls are unwashed.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The Order of Myruun once used this chamber as a guard post. Aside from the rod (see Treasure), however, this room contains nothing of interest or value.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** A PC who succeeds at a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a rod under the table. A further DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check notes that the craftsmanship on the rod is of masterwork quality. Anyone making a DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check learns that this rod was transmuted into wood from some sort of metal. It was actually a **rod of silence** (cast a 2nd-level *silence* once per day without using a spell slot. Does not require attunement). Nothing short of a *wish* spell can restore it, and the rod is completely non-magical unless restored.

**Scaling:** N/A

### C2: Former Storage Room

> A few broken chairs line the edges of this room. It appears as if the chairs were stacked there, but the wood is rotted and worm infested.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The Order of Myruun once used this chamber to store goods. It has long been unused. After the PCs spend 30 minutes in this room, roll for a Random Encounter.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** This room contains only rubbish.

### C3: Ethereal Filcher's Lair

PCs succeeding at a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notice the floor in front of the secret door is worn. The solid stone door itself is otherwise indistinguishable from the wall. The massive door spins on a vertical, central spindle so pushing the left side of the door, for example, causes the right side of it to swing outward. To open the door, characters must make a DC 20 Strength check while pushing on only the left or right side of it. The broken pieces of a spent gas trap are the primary reason the door is so difficult to open. Clearing the debris from the doorway allows the door to swing freely on its axis.

> As the door of this chamber opens, a fetid stench is released. Within the darkness, tiny flecks of reflected light sparkle and shine. A closer look reveals a dark shape moving slowly, as more twinkling lights appear.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** This is the home of a Large ethereal filcher. The creature arrived at the prison sometime after the wizard Arum's successful experiment. It has gathered quite a collection of coins, gems, baubles, and other shiny objects over the years. Though it can travel outside the ethereal pocket, its survival instincts prevent it from leaving for extended periods. When the PCs enter its lair, it stands quietly in the corner of the room in ethereal form, waiting for them to leave.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), Concealment

**Tactics:** Though not particularly intelligent, this creature learned to use its jaunt ability very effectively. It remains hidden unless attacked or angered. If the PCs take more than a few baubles from the room, its attitude changes to hostile and it charges them. Its favorite tactic is to use its jaunt to surprise its opponents. Between attacks, it positions itself for the best chance at surprise. If combat starts for any reason, the filcher fights until its hit points total drops below half. When this happens, it jaunts to another room and remains there until it feels safe enough to return to its lair.

**Treasure:** Though it is impressive to see this much treasure displayed in such a small space, it quickly becomes apparent that the total value of this amassed fortune is less than it appears. A DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check estimates most items are colored glass or quartz, which brings the total value of all the treasure in the room to about 55 gp. Under the almost worthless jewels and trinkets are 5 old wax candles and badly worn vestments.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a second ethereal filcher. To decrease the challenge, reduce the filcher's hit points by 30.

### C4: Small Shrine

> The floors and walls of this room are surprisingly clean but the most prominent feature is a small but old shrine standing neglected against the eastern wall. This simple wooden shrine is engraved with an ancient symbol.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The followers of Myruun used this small shrine to meditate in quiet solitude. Good-aligned PCs feel comfortable and at ease when they enter this chamber. All good characters that rest for at least one hour in this room gain the benefit of *bless* and *aid* for 1 hour after they leave the shrine.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** A successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check of the shrine reveals a folded piece of parchment slid into a seam near the top of the altar.

The parchment starts as a standard prayer written to the goddess Myruun. A DC 17 Intelligence (Religion) check allows PCs to notice ancient references to Myruun, an old goddess of oceans, travel, and vigilance. PCs making this check also know that Myruun is no longer worshiped. Near the bottom of the parchment the text trails off and a few short sentences were hastily written. These have nothing to do with the rest of the parchment. The sentences read "She calls at last! Gladly will I lay down my life for my Queen! She calls to us all!"

*This parchment is a fragment of the Lost Paladins' tale.*

**Scaling:** N/A

### C5: Main Temple

> An intolerable stench escapes when the door to this chamber is opened, temporarily dulling the opulence of the high-vaulted ceilings and painted walls inside the room. The powerful scent is enough to make even the strongest dwarf blanch in disgust. There is a horribly decayed giant bat corpse in the corner that's causing the cloying odor here. A closer look inside reveals that the walls of this chamber are painted white but are dusty and a large stone altar is pushed up against the southern wall.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** The intricately carved doors leading into this room foretell the importance and prestige given to the temple inside. PCs outside the door succeeding at a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check hear wings flapping from within. Two giant bats were lured and trapped inside the room several months ago. Though only one is still alive, it is now maddened with thoughts of freedom.

PCs entering the room must make a DC 12 Constitution save or become infected by Slimy Doom: each hour, an infected character's skin is gradually covered in gooey gel.

> **Slimy Doom.** Immediately and at the end of each hour, an infected PC's maximum hit points are reduced by 2d6. After each reduction, the infected PC may reattempt the saving throw, ending the disease on a success. Maximum hit points are restored only after the disease has ended and the PC completes a Long Rest.

PCs succeeding at a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check confirm that the fallen bat died of slimy doom. The other dire bat is trapped here, which has made it angry and afraid.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The surviving giant bat immediately attacks anyone opening either door leading into this room as it pushes to escape its cell. If it surprises the PCs, it attempts to force its way past, flying down the corridor outside of the room. Otherwise it moves into the doorway and attacks the closest PC, doing everything possible to prevent being sealed inside the room again. At the earliest opportunity, it flies down the corridor away from the temple.

**Treasure:** There is nothing left of value in this room. Even the altar near the south wall is empty.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have characters who start their turn within 5 ft. of the dire bat make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned from the stench. The condition lasts until they leave the room. To decrease the challenge, eliminate the opportunity for the dire bat to surprise the PCs.

### C6: Former Armory

The door to this room is locked and trapped. PCs who succeed at a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check discover poison smeared on the locking mechanism. Avoiding direct skin contact with the lock is the only way to bypass the trap. However, the poison coating the lock has lost potency over the years because of the moisture inside the room and previous attempts at picking it. Any contact with the poison causes a painful rash on the skin, regardless of the save.

> **Locking Mechanism Coated with Contact Poison Trap.** Detect: DC 17 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 16 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools); Characters making contact with the surface must make a DC 10 Constitution save or suffer 1d4+1 poison damage.

Picking the lock under normal circumstances requires a DC 16 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check. Anyone picking the lock without touching the surface, or while wearing gloves, has Disadvantage on the check.

> This warm and musty room holds many worm ridden wooden racks for weapons on its walls. Though a few rusty swords remain, most are useless because the leather bindings or wooden shafts are decayed beyond repair over the years.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Other than a few scraps of cloth and wood, this room is bare. If the PCs spend 30 minutes in this room, roll for a Random Encounter.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** PCs succeeding at a DC 15 Intelligence check notice a masterwork quality metal warhammer head coated with a thin wax preventing rust. All the other weapons are either too rusted or damaged to be of any interest.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the poison damage to 2d10. To decrease the challenge, decrease the detection and lock pick DCs by -3.

---

### C7: Former Assistant's Office

> Though it is easy to determine this chamber once served as a living room, the current state of disrepair implies someone took great pains to destroy everything that was not worth escaping with. Dark stains splatter the walls and floors and broken pieces of glass, wood, and stone are piled in a great heap.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This was the office of the second in command of the Order of Myruun, but the place was sacked long ago.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** PCs wishing to search the rubble need to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discover a cracked floor tile, broken when the room's contents were piled on the floor. Underneath this floor tile is a space with a small diary and a holy symbol of Myruun. The holy symbol is attached to a silver chain with a broken clasp easily repaired with the appropriate tools. This symbol, which represents a flat round earth filled with oceans, is worth upwards of 250 gp to historians and members of religious orders interested in the history of the old goddess Myruun and her clergy.

The diary has writing on nearly every surface of every page. The first page has a rather verbose title, "The Diary of Thomas Corsek, Paladin of Myruun the Vigilant, Lady of Travel, Queen of the Oceans. Being a diary pertaining to personal events of life and service as squire to my brother, Geoff Corsek, and my Queen." Next to Geoff Corsek, the words "The Gold General" were written and circled, as if added at a much later date. Written in much smaller text at the bottom of the page is the additional subtitle, "And being a record of the Calling as we travel to a post my Lady has given us, to turn the tide as my Queen instructed."

PCs spending at least one hour reading through the pages of the diary find many entries characteristic of a young man who idolizes his older brother yet doubts his own abilities. The diary tends to be vague in reference to details about locations or dates, but rather specific about personal goals, religious rituals, and specific prayers as if recording these rituals helped to learn them. "The Gold General" refers both to the narrator's brother's uncanny ability to find chests of gold lost as sea and his quality as a leader of men. After the first dozen entries or so, there is a sentence written in a different style that reads, "Though I am not worthy of her grace, my Queen has bid me travel with Geoff to stand vigil under the ground."

PCs reading the diary completely and who make a DC 15 Intelligence check note the total time spanning from the first entry written inside the garrison to the last entry in the diary is nearly three years.

*This is another piece of the Lost Paladins' tale.*

### C8: Former Commander's Meeting Room

> Another collection of debris is stacked in the center of this room, and the eastern wall is covered in black soot around the remains of the charred husk of the door. Despite the signs of fire damage coming from the next room, this pile of debris is built with non-combustible materials like twisted metal, broken stone, and mortar.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The commander of the Order of Myruun and his subordinates once used this chamber as a meeting place.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 6

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** This room has a floor tile with a secret compartment underneath it in the same position as in Room C7. Anyone specifically looking there finds the compartment, otherwise a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to uncover it. A leather parchment traveling case is hidden underneath the tile. It contains documents, two quills, and a vial of dried ink.

The documents contain duty rosters and work assignments for 41 people, as well as various maps of the lands surrounding the dungeon. Most maps have markings denoting the lines of travel various individuals took to arrive at this garrison. These maps are all external, stopping at the entrance in Region A. The interior map of the garrison area is notably missing, although the duty rosters clearly refer to it.

**Scaling:** N/A

### C9: Former Commander's Chamber

> The door of this room is a heavily damaged frame that hangs upon a solitary remaining hinge. The area was clearly incinerated completely some time in the past. The chamber itself is blackened with soot covering the entire floor, walls, and ceiling. The pile of ash in the center of the room shows where an enormous fire blazed, long ago.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room was the leader of the Order of Myruun's private abode. But now, an athach (a 3-armed, green-skinned giant) named Nurganar makes his home here. He moves back and forth throughout the region, so there is only a 25% chance of finding him here at any one time. If the PCs encountered (and killed) Nurganar as a random encounter, he is not here. If he is here, he is counting his coins or organizing his belongings.

This chamber has a floor tile with a secret compartment underneath it in the same position as in Rooms C7 and C8. Anyone specifically looking there finds the compartment, otherwise a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to uncover it. Nurganar keeps his treasure under the floor tile (thinking it safe there).

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If battle ensues in his lair, Nurganar positions himself to defend his treasure. Though most of what he owns is worthless, he believes the shiny objects he collects are extremely valuable, so he avidly defends his treasure. Given the opportunity, he targets the physically strongest PC first, concentrating all his attacks on this one foe.

If reduced to 25% or less of his total hit points, Nurganar begs for his life, offering the PCs his treasure in exchange for their mercy. He does not ask twice, though and fights viciously if they mock or betray his good nature.

**Treasure:** Nurganar loves to collect all manner of shiny objects. Under a thick fur rug (worth 20 gp) in the corner of the room is a multitude of colored glass shards, glistening rocks, and a handful of semi-precious gemstones. Though the five gems are worth 10 gp each, the other items are honestly worthless to all but the athach.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, give Nurganar Sneak Attack (3d6 damage) and have him wait in Ambush (darkness). To decrease the challenge, have him return from a long jaunt, fatigued, with halved movement speed and Disadvantage on attack rolls.

### C10: Fake Door

> Written in Common on the surface of this otherwise normal door are the words, "WARNING! DO NOT ENTER! DANGER!" The letters are written in burgundy paint.

The moment the door is touched, a ghostly outline of a wild-haired old woman floats through the middle of the doorway.

> The red lettering of warnings remains visible behind the translucent body as the creature moans, "This is now your second warning. You will not receive a third. Stay out of this room." Even as the form is speaking the last few words, it sinks back into the door and disappears entirely.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The door was designed to fool creatures venturing into the dungeon. It leads to a solid wall.

The ghost is a programmed illusion that resets after 5 minutes. Anyone ignoring the warning and entering the room must succeed at a DC 25 Dexterity check to unlock the door. The door handle is on the left side of the door, which opens outward. The wall behind it is painted completely black to heighten the illusion of a dark and forbidding room, but it is nevertheless made of solid rock.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Visions 5, [Haunted]

### C11: Former Store

> This small chamber is empty. A thick blanket of dust covers its floor, suggesting that no one set foot in this area in a long time.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The members of the Order of Myruun once used this room to store goods, but it is now empty. The lock on the door to this room is of particularly high quality. It was added by a locksmith servant of Myruun when the deity's last followers were called to this region of the dungeon. Unlike most other locks in the region, it is made of silvery iron. The mechanism, in fact, looks brand new. Anyone attempting to pick the door must make a DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Most of the goods stored in this chamber were brought to Rooms C8 and C9 where they were put to flame, as the Paladins of Myruun knew they were all going to die and did not want these items to fall in the hands of evil creatures. However, small piles of broken glass collect dust in the corner of the rooms. In addition to the glass, there are 13 stone arrowheads and a small piece of smooth volcanic glass with the symbol of Myruun etched on one side. PCs who succeed at DC 15 Intelligence checks recognize the volcanic glass curio used to have a pendant and be worth as much as 50 gp if it were fashioned into another piece of jewelry.

**Scaling:** N/A

### C12: Former Meditation Chamber

> Several thick woolen blankets are lined upon the floor of this small room. The blankets are dusty and rotting to pieces. The walls of the room were painted with a soothing green shade, but cracks have begun to appear in the otherwise smooth surfaces, revealing the dark bedrock behind.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The followers of Myruun used this private cell to meditate, rest, or pray in peace.

**Encounter Condition:** Positive Energy, Safe

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** There is nothing in the room, except for the useless blankets.

**Scaling:** N/A

### C13: Former Common Room

A DC 27 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the secret door on the south wall. It is extremely difficult to find, mostly because it hasn't been opened in hundreds of years. Anyone finding the secret door needs to make a DC 25 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to determine how to unlock it. The locking mechanism is simple but must be triggered each time the door is opened, but no special tools are required. Anyone succeeding at a DC 12 Dexterity check can open the hidden portal once they understand how to manipulate the device. No check is required to open the doors from inside the secret passageway.

> This room has two doorways in the northeast corner. The door to the north has been torn off its hinges and removed from the frame while the one to the east is barred. There are hooks in the southern and northern walls at various points, indicating that large tapestries or paintings were once displayed there. In the center of the hall, metal fastenings are attached to the floor, as if a dining table had once been affixed here as well. Two broken chairs are tossed casually in the southwestern corner.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Unless the PCs find the secret corridor, this room holds nothing of interest.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

### C14: Large Meeting Room

PCs making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, or a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discover that both stone doors are heavily detailed. The creators of the doors even added stone rivets and a simulated locking mechanism, nearly identical to other doors found throughout the dungeon. Even the stone bars fastened across the eastern door have a peculiar wooden grain to them. PCs succeeding at a DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check realize the doors were changed into stone, underscoring the extraordinary measures taken to keep something from getting out of the next room.

Anyone attempting to open the eastern door must first lift the 600 lb. stone bars from their slots. The top bar is set 4 ft. from the floor and the lower bar rests 2 ft. below the first. Once the bars are laid to the side, the door still requires a DC 18 Strength check to pull open.

> The heavy stone door leading into this room scrapes along the floor until it gets stuck after three feet. The room's interior is more barren than normal. Stains and scuff marks are visible along the ground and walls though someone wiped the dirt and dust clean. Another large stone door is found on the east wall, locked with two heavy stone bars.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** If the PCs spend 2 hours in this room, roll for a random encounter. It is otherwise safe.

**Encounter Condition:** [Safe]

**Tactics:** N/A

### C15: Former Barracks

> There are three more doorways leading out of this room, but the doors and frames are gone. The openings lead to other chambers, which appear to be the same size as the main room. Oozing through the doorway of the easternmost chamber is a glob of black goo. It is impossible to determine how vast it is because it completely covers the doorway as it slowly squeezes into the main room.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** About 20 years ago, Arum the Wizard trapped a black pudding inside this room after narrowly escaping its grasp. Guptu the Pale, an ogre mage who was a thorn in Arum's side for years after the paladin's last battle, had set an ambush for Arum with the pudding. Guptu and Arum faced off many times before the ogre mage was killed, but this pudding was his most deadly trap.

To contain the black pudding, Arum polymorphed the iron door and wooden bars into stone, hoping to seal the creature inside. He knew the pudding would continue to grow until it devoured everything in the barracks, but he also knew it would never escape on its own. In the event someone did manage to set it free, he cleaned the meeting room of everything the pudding could consume and sealed this chamber with another stone door.

The pudding is now so big that it fills whichever room it occupies in the former barracks. It has consumed everything inside the chamber, including the missing doors and hinges. But because it must force its way through the small doorways to move from room to room, it is slower than normal. It has a speed of 5-ft. and a 10-ft. reach. However, any pieces splitting from the host body move and attack normally.

PCs succeeding at DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) checks hear the odd sound of the pudding's motion, like a gelatinous liquid piling up, or a slow scraping waterfall. The sound is coming from the central eastern cubicles.

**Encounter Condition:** Cursed 4

**Tactics:** By the time the PCs find the black pudding, it has already sensed the PCs and is moving to attack. It moves directly toward the closest PC, switching direction if the PCs run to another room. The pudding cannot split itself on its own and only attacks in one direction at a time.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the speed and reach of the pudding by 10 ft. and 5 ft. respectively. To decrease the challenge, reduce the black pudding's hit points by 60.

### C16: Cockatrice Maze

> The walls here are worn. Corridors turn sharply at random intervals or end abruptly. In addition, sound seems to soak right into the walls, muffling footsteps and speech.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** There are signs that someone attempted to dig further into the rock and stone near several of the dead-end passages. No tools can be found, but there are piles of dirt and gravel in the area.

About six years ago, a goblin from Region B got separated from his raiding party and stumbled upon the secret door leading west. After going through the room, he found the cockatrice's lair, was bitten, and turned to stone. The cockatrice entered the secret passage to ward off any other trespassers, but the door closed behind it. Since then, the cockatrice has wandered throughout the maze trying to find its way back to its lair.

Many wanderers have found their way into the maze since then, only to be turned to stone by the crazed beast that attacks everything coming across its path (see Room C19 for more cockatrice victims). The PCs should stumble upon the cockatrice when rounding a corner, as the cockatrice is most often found wandering this region.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush

**Tactics:** When encountered, the cockatrice attacks, turning weaker PCs to stone. If wounded, it flees to Room C19, unless it is cornered. If given no chance to escape, it fiercely attacks the closest PC, until it has a chance to flee. The gargoyle in Room C19 has helped it fight off attackers in the past.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, allow the cockatrice to surprise the PCs or attack from darkness. To decrease the challenge, have the cockatrice flee to Room C19 at the sound of footsteps.

### C17: Former Guard Post

The moment the door latch is turned, it swings inward as a giant guillotine-like pendulum attached to the ceiling descends. Inside, along the north wall, there are six nail holes some six feet off the ground. Resting on its side in the southeastern corner is an old wooden chair with three legs.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** PCs who make a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notice that the door is unlocked, but that there is constant tension upon it. Anyone making a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers there is no way to bypass or disarm this trap but realizes that it can be triggered at a safe distance. The trap was poorly designed, as the pendulum is fastened to the ceiling directly above the doorway. This causes it to slam against the frame, stopping its progress at the bottom of its arc of motion. The trap can only hit someone standing directly in front of the door.

> **Ceiling Pendulum Trap.** Detect: DC 15 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools); A character standing in front of the bladed pendulum must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or take 3d12 + 8 slashing damage.

A DC 27 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the secret door on the north wall. This door is extremely difficult to find because it has not been opened in centuries. Anyone finding the secret door needs to make a DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to determine how to unlock it. The locking mechanism must be triggered each time the door is opened, but no special tools are required. Anyone making a DC 10 Dexterity check can open the hidden portal once they understand how to manipulate the opening device. No check is required to open the door from inside the secret passageway.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Except for the broken chair, trap, and the secret passageway, this room holds nothing else of interest.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the damage of the trap to 5d12 + 8. To decrease the challenge, reduce the damage dealt by the trap to 3d8.

### C18: Former Sparring Room

> Two great stone chairs face each other across this wide room, as if waiting for opposing generals to sit and watch their champions compete. The chair to the west resembles a sailing vessel, the back support being a large mast with two cross beams and the armrests tapering into the semblance of a prow. The chair to the east is shaped to look like a tsunami, curled back upon itself and preparing to douse whoever sits in its path. Both chairs are about 10 ft. in front of their respective walls.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This was the Paladins' exercise room, as well as a place to hold contests for sport, and settling disputes. PCs who make DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notice a faint 20-ft.-wide square painted on the ground in the center of the room. They also see the ground near the western chair is scraped and marred, as if the chair had been moved and left slightly askew.

The western chair releases a cloud of insanity mist if it is moved in any direction. Anyone standing between a 10 ft. radius to a 20 ft. radius from the chair is allowed a DC 15 Dexterity save to jump outside the poisonous cloud and avoid its effect, but anyone closer is automatically caught in the mist. This trap cannot be bypassed, but it is only activated when the chair is moved. The eastern chair is not trapped.

> **Insanity Mist Vapor Trap.** Detect: DC 15 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools); Characters in a 10-ft.-square area suffer confusion for 3 rounds.

Anyone succeeding at a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check values the chairs at well over 1,000 gp each, because of the unique craftsmanship.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, inflict a short-term madness on each character hit with the insanity mist. To decrease the challenge, allow each character caught by the mist a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to negate the effects.

### C19: Large Mural Room

Both doors to this room are open.

> The rows of goblin and gnoll statues arranged in this room contrast with most of the stark and empty rooms found so far. There are also several murals painted on the walls, looking as clean and bright as the day they were painted. The art on the north wall shows a knight in shining golden armor, standing at the prow of a ship and looking out at an endless ocean. The west wall depicts a battle between a battered ship and a coiled sea serpent, as a bolt of lightning comes down from the sky to strike the serpent. The east wall shows a breathtaking picture of a beautiful woman looking out over a calm sea at sunset, as if awaiting the return of her beloved.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** The murals painted on the walls are magically protected, so it is impossible to erase them or dilute their colors. If the PCs study the murals, they notice titles written in Common painted at the bottoms of the pictures. The western mural is entitled "The Oceans," the northern is called "The Journey," and the eastern is simply labeled "Vigilance." In addition to the titles, further inspection reveals the incredible detail in each mural. It is clear to everyone that these paintings would be priceless if they had been painted on a portable canvas.

The statues in the room are arranged into four rows. There are seven gnoll, seven goblin, and three human statues in addition to the gargoyle that haunts the place. None of the statues in the room are on bases except for the gargoyle standing on a square stone block in the second row from the west. Anyone examining the statues can make a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to realize the gargoyle is alive. The three human statues are in the second row from the east. The statue at the north end of the row is of a man dressed in hides who just finished a powerful, two-handed swing with his warhammer. The second statue from the south is of a woman in studded leather armor with an empty bow, reaching behind her back for another arrow. The last statue in that row shows a small, wiry man in leather armor standing on one leg, as if dodging something. All the goblin and gnoll statues have similar poses, but most of them show horrified faces.

Anyone making a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check while studying the statues discovers hairline cracks and chips in all of them. In addition, several of them have heads that were broken off and placed back upon the neck. All the statues were once humanoids petrified by the cockatrice before being dragged here by the gargoyle. None of them would survive the transformation back to flesh.

This room is the home of a gargoyle, but the creature does not move until discovered or combat begins with the PCs. Unless the PCs killed the cockatrice in Room C16, it is also hiding here. Allow a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to see the cockatrice as it moves away from them, trying to hide behind the statues.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush, Concealment, Echoes 4

**Tactics:** The gargoyle attacks if it is discovered, if the cockatrice enters combat, or if a PC turns his back on it while within close range. In any of these circumstances, the gargoyle attempts to gain surprise on the closest PC. If none are within range, it maneuvers to attack unarmored opponents first. The gargoyle performs a full attack whenever possible. If present, the cockatrice avoids the PCs and does not attack unless it is cornered or they attack the gargoyle. If the gargoyle is destroyed, or it has less than 10 hit points remaining, the cockatrice flees back to Room C16.

**Treasure:** Except for the murals, which cannot be removed, the room is empty.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add an additional damage die to each of the gargoyle's attacks. To decrease the challenge, the gargoyle begins the encounter wounded (-40 hit points).

## C20-C21: Path of Destruction

The demon imprisoned in room C21 has many names. His true name is still unknown, and this is perhaps the main reason he has been so consistently elusive. He is most often referred to as Falortuligo, which translates into Common as "the clever ash," or "Ash, the Trickster." In addition to his ability to escape imprisonment of any kind, Ash is renowned for being a malicious tormentor.

That reputation was the primary reason he earned a special place in this prison. His cell was designed with no exit and its entrance is a specially constructed gateway, set inside two archways to create a one-way portal into the cell. The cell was flooded with water and eight massive cold iron chains were designed to seek and clamp down on any heat source entering the place. When the chains found purchase on the demon that was transported here, the runes on the walls of the cell activated and froze everything solid.

Ash was discovered by a group of angels and captured. He was then transported to the cell's entry chamber after construction was completed (room C110). The demon offered little resistance until the last moment, when he pushed a solar angel named Amarantiel into the prison portal. Right before he was forced inside himself, Amarantiel (which means "Unfading Vigilance" in the Celestial tongue) knew there would be no escape from the cell. He accepted his imprisonment, fighting to subdue Ash in order to hasten the freezing process. Though unable to prevent one chain from attaching itself to his body, Amarantiel directed the other seven chains to Ash. The magical walls then froze them both in solid ice for millennia.

If Amarantiel thought his unjust interment would be spent in quiet contemplation, he was quickly corrected by Ash. From the first hour of their confinement, Falortuligo initiated a telepathic dialog with Amarantiel. Over the centuries, Ash embedded thoughts and voices into Amarantiel's mind, convincing him that the angel had been falsely imprisoned. During the last hundred years of their imprisonment, the demon twisted his soothing words until Amarantiel believed Ash was another solar angel.

The final key to unlocking Ash's prison came when the wizard Arum arrived. A decade or so ago, Arum built a laboratory (in room C20) and Ash took the opportunity to speak telepathically with the wizard. Arum believed Ash was a falsely imprisoned angel, caught when the demon Falortuligo was placed in his cell within the prison complex. The demon told Arum it was impossible for him to gain freedom without also setting the demon free. Arum was warned against telling anyone they had spoken, to prevent the possibility of someone freeing the angel, because it would also release the demon. Ash's steadfast refusal of all offers of assistance, lest the demon be set free, convinced Arum that the voice in his head was that of the angel Amarantiel.

Posing as Amarantiel, Ash asked nothing of the wizard, but occasionally conversed with Arum during his studies. These conversations became more frequent as Arum asked "Ash" for advice on magical theories and practices while working in his lab. It was during one such discussion about the creation of magical weaponry that Ash set in motion a plan that would lead to his inevitable release.

Arum complained about spending too much time maintaining his forge to generate sufficient heat, and that his research was suffering as a result. Ash suggested placing wards on the front of the forge to reflect the heat back into the walls. A higher level of heat would then be maintained. Not coincidentally, this would also focus a great amount of heat on the stone wall surrounding the prison. Arum, however, did not know how close he was to Ash's icy prison cell.

It was this mixture of intense cold from the prison and constant heat from the forge that eventually cracked the wall separating Rooms C20 and C21 and melted the ice to water, which boiled away into the forge. Once the wall was weakened, Falortuligo and Amarantiel broke free.

When they broke through the wall of the prison, the members of the Order of Merunda confronted them. At first, Amarantiel believed Ash was another angel, and he did not understand why the Paladins of Merunda fought him. For millennia, the demon deceived Amarantiel, who now believed Ash was his kin.

While the brave followers of Merunda fought the demon, Arum used several illusions to trick Amarantiel into activating his true sight. It was then that the veil was lifted from the angel's eyes and he understood the nature of Ash's treachery. The Paladins of Merunda gave their lives to allow Amarantiel to see through the demon's lies. Their sacrifice allowed the angel to regain his senses and slay the demon.

The events leading up to the final confrontation between the demon and Amarantiel is recorded in Arum's account of the battle in Room C64.
