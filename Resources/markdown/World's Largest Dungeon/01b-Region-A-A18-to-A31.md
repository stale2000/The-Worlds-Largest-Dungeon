# Region A (continued)

## A18. Northern Hallway Room

All three doors in this room are open.

This room appears to be a junction, with three open doorways leading in different directions. Like the previous two rooms, it is empty. Something about it indicates the room was used for something else, a long time ago. Your intuition is screaming this place is more than just an underground vault. Perhaps a prison. Or a torture chamber. A place where things were collected and stored. The lack of any features seems almost alien and fiendish.

### Features

As in Rooms A16 and A17, this Room is completely empty. It served as a junction Room and defense point for the orcs. Before that, it would have been a transfer point for prisoners. The doors and wall radiate the faintest abjuration magic to those who would detect it.

### Creatures

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

If they have not spotted the PCs previously, six **fiendish stirges** alternate flying and hopping about the room, obviously agitated. Deciding that this was an excellent spot to wait for potential prey, the six have taken up residence. However, given their alignment, the fiendish stirges do not trust one another. As such, they continuously hop and fly from perch to perch to prevent one another from being the first to feed.

The stirges have been mutated and transformed by the fiendish magic that claimed them. Their hooked bills are split in two, segmenting their faces. Their eyes have grown into two vertical, but not symmetrical, sets on each side of their faces. Each fiendish stirge is slightly different from the next but with terrifying and bizarre visages.

**Encounter Condition:** Concealment

### Tactics

When one of the fiendish stirges sees or hears something of interest, it goes to investigate, and the others follow. In the case of the PCs moving through A16 and A17 or either of the hallways, roll Wisdom (Perception) checks for the fiendish stirges as the PCs move. On a successful Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 13), one of the fiendish stirges has either seen the PCs or heard them and flies off to investigate. One round later, two more fiendish stirges follow the first, and on the third round, the remaining ones follow. The lead fiendish stirge attacks the first PC it comes across, and the others join in as soon as they arrive.

Each fiendish stirge fights as an individual and will not cooperate with another stirge. They prefer to seek out their own victims rather than share. As a result, each PC finds themselves fighting at least one stirge directly. In combat, the stirges use their ability to fly to dart in, drain a PC, and then evade retribution. They continually switch the PC they're attacking, buzzing about and around the group like flies around red meat.

An individual fiendish stirge will not pursue a fleeing PC as long as there is an open PC in the immediate area.

Although aggressive, the fiendish stirges are also cowards. If damaged, each flees, abandoning the others to their fate. If two of the six are killed, the remaining flee.

A satiated fiendish stirge (one that has drained 4 points of Constitution) will fly off down the hallway to the east to find a place to digest its meal.

### Treasure

N/A

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, have all six of the fiendish stirges arrive at the same time. To decrease the challenge of the encounter, have two of the fiendish stirges begin to fight each other rather than the PCs.

It is possible that this fight will be over quickly. Feel free to bring in more scavenger-type reinforcements—more dire rats, for instance. Have another stirge show up, but it has a series of weird powers and even more messed-up features. The list goes on.

## A19. Refuse

PCs approaching within 20 ft of this alcove become aware of the putrid smell. Read the following text when they reach the alcove.

You have traced the smell to its source: a hole some eighteen inches in diameter cracks the stone floor in the corner. Two fat, deformed worms lie dead inside the hole. Each worm is about a foot in diameter and several feet long. One climbs up from the hole, the other locked around the head of the first. The first has a ruptured stomach and smells of offal.

It appears that the first died from the inside out, splitting itself open from overeating. The second appears to have started to eat the first and choked to death, if that is possible? Rats have, regardless, avoided this easy feast.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

The hole is actually a small crack that appeared during a minor earthquake. The hole has become a home for trash, refuse, and disease. Giant, unforeseen, discolored, and diseased worms have died inside the hole. Any contact with the stone, trash, or worms makes one susceptible to catching **filth fever**.

**Filth Fever:** DC 11 Constitution save. On a failure: in 1d3 days, Dexterity and Constitution are each reduced by 1d4 until the disease is removed. Repeat save every 8 hours. Filth Fever ends after three consecutive successful DC 11 Constitution saves.

**Encounter Condition:** Diseased (filth fever), Stagnant Air

### Tactics

Consider adding the sound of insects and vermin as the PCs approach. While there is a warning of what they are approaching, the creatures need not look like anything they've seen before. Mutate the bugs, if necessary. They feed on the worms slowly.

## A20. Orghar's Quarters

The door to this Room is open as is the secret door in the eastern wall.

A table, a stool, and a bed, all intact, sit across from the door. In the center of the room, a circle of six stools surrounds a small mound of dirt on the floor. An otherworldly feeling of evil permeates the air. Just standing at the doorway, one can feel something bad happened here.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

This was Orghar's bedroom and headquarters. The Room is almost exactly as he left it when he went to lead the orcs in the final assault against the reptilians. But evil lingers here. Those sensitive to it cannot avoid it.

Orghar's evil permeates everything here. And all because of a ring. A ring gifted by Achsyyx to Longtail made it into Orghar's possession a little while ago. And that ring has driven Orghar to impossible levels of evil.

The ring serves one purpose: to amplify evil. Though it is long gone from here (now in Room A82), the evil remains. Anyone casting *detect good and evil* finds remnants around the room.

On the top of the table is a summoning circle, crudely drawn, perhaps as practice for a real circle somewhere else. A hollowed-out kobold skull sits on the table along with a backscratcher carved from a lizardfolk thigh bone. The bed, a plank with four legs, still holds Orghar's blanket and a pillow made from troglodyte skin and stuffed with the hair of orcs his clan has defeated in combat. The six stools were where Orghar would hold his planning meetings, while the dirt served as a crude chalkboard to illustrate his plans. In good military fashion, whatever had been drawn on the dirt is obscured.

The secret doors in the southern and eastern walls are opened with pressure plates in the floor. The plates are stones like any other but are tightly pressed against the wall, so finding them isn't easy. Once the plate is pressed, a latch is released, and the secret door can open easily.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Treasure

Orghar hollowed out one of the legs of his bed; a search of the bed reveals this (DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check). Inside the leg, he stowed seven small pieces of **jade** (each worth 4d4 × 10 gp). Although he meant to retrieve the jade, Orghar forgot about the gems and has yet to be back for them. The jade pieces have been tainted with evil, like most of Orghar's effects. The taint will dissipate eventually, but touching them is ill-advised.

Behind a few bits of wood, a leather pouch with a **deck of playing cards** featuring four new suits (sword, fireball, whip, and spider) and a **gold ring with an opal inlay** (worth 280 gp) are hidden.

## A21. The Secret Room

The eastern door leading to Room A72 is trapped. Pulling the door open releases scything blades located underneath it. The blades swing out at anyone standing closest to the door (usually the person opening the door; each blade swings into the square directly in front of the door), dealing **2d8 damage**. A hidden bolt near the outside edge of the door can be pushed down to keep the blades in place. The trap is reset when the door is closed.

Spots of blood on the floor outside the door hint at a trap, but in the darkness the PCs may not notice it.

Several rough tables are scattered throughout this room. Poorly constructed chairs are pushed under the tables. Everything is coated with a fine layer of dust.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

This Room has not been occupied in quite some time, somehow being missed through all the years it stood empty.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe

### Tactics

Despite the trapped door, this Room is an excellent place for the PCs to rest. The room tends to swallow up the light, halving the distance of torches and candles. Light-based magic works normally.

### Treasure

A careful search (Intelligence (Investigation) check, DC 16) reveals a few minor personal effects that escaped notice over the years—a personal brooch, a snuff box, and a perfectly round pebble that inexplicably weighs two pounds.

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, add fire and/or radiant damage and a second set of blades that swings out from behind. To decrease the challenge, allow the PCs a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check because of the blood.

## A22-A24. Pillar Rooms

Rooms A22 to A24 are part of the original construction of this dungeon. Although the dungeon's creators did not require much comfort, they did create some places to pass the time. This is one of the areas and consists of these three Rooms, each with a different function.

The humanoids all knew of these Rooms but only used Room A22 for its water supply. They never realized the magical properties of Room A23 and avoided Room A24 due to the uncomfortable silence. Currently, there is only one monster in these Rooms.

---

## A22. Water Pillars

The door to this Room is open.

You hear the sound of trickling water as you approach. The sound comes from four pillars, one in each corner of the large room, with water channels cut into them.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

The running water imposes disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks to hear made by any creatures either while in the Room and trying to listen to noise within or outside the Room, or for creatures outside of the Room trying to make out noises from inside the Room.

This Room, along with Rooms A23 and A24, is actually part of the original construction of the dungeon. The water that runs down the pillars is the result of a permanent *create or destroy water* effect that resides in a hole in the top of each pillar. Water flows down a channel cut into the pillar, which is somewhat larger at its base than at its top, and ends up in a small 1-ft. diameter and 1-ft. deep pool at the base of the pillar. Thanks to the magic, the system is constantly in balance, and as long as no more than two gallons of water are taken in any round, no drop in the water flow or in the pool will be noticed.

If *detect magic* is used on the pillars, they radiate a strong (but old) transmutation aura. Destroying the pillars destroys the magic. Although the original inhabitants did not need the water for survival, it is perfectly drinkable.

Except for the pillars, this Room is otherwise empty. There were once meditation mats but they are long gone. Rotted pieces might still be around the room.

**Encounter Condition:** Drafty or Poor Footing

### Creatures

Before the PCs have a chance to refresh themselves, they must contend with **Bragdor the ogre** that is currently catching a rest here.

Bragdor's face is covered with scars from fighting darkmantles. Though the wounds aren't new, they haven't completely healed yet. His greatclub has rat teeth buried throughout its length, partially as ornamentation and partially for effect. The handle is wrapped in darkmantle skin. Bragdor carries a very sharp camp knife. He uses it mostly for odd jobs, not fighting. But it'll cut someone up pretty well in a pinch.

### Tactics

Bragdor the ogre is not the brightest of fellows, but even he knows when he is overmatched and the beasts that are crawling all over the dungeon intimidate even him. Of course, he can deal with the humanoids, and the PCs are ideal for taking out his frustrations.

Even though he sits on the ground, resting his bulk against the northeastern pillar, Bragdor notices any light source moving down the hallway or coming from A23 readily enough, and once he spots it, he readies himself for some sport. Due to the noise of the water falling, he is unlikely to hear any creatures before they enter the Room unless they are making a lot of noise (the ogre suffers disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen). Depending on where the light is coming from, he attempts to hide his bulk behind a pillar (the northwestern pillar if the light comes from the hall or simply standing by the pillar he is resting against if the light is coming from Room A23).

If Bragdor manages to hide, he is actually difficult to Spot in the shadow of the pillar (DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check) until a light shines on him, at which point he is easily seen. Whether he is hidden or not, the moment he spots something, he takes a defensive pose, gauging how the PCs will act.

**Combat Tactics:** If forced to fight, Bragdor does not hold back. Like most ogres, Bragdor is a bully. As long as he feels that he has the advantage over his opponents, he gladly bashes them away with his huge club. Consider giving Bragdor an advantage on his next roll after a round in which he deals 10 or more points of damage.

**Parley:** If the PCs gain Bragdor's respect, either by reducing him to one-half or fewer of his hit points using physical attacks or by causing at least 15 points of damage from spell attacks, the ogre changes his tactics. He backs away from his foes toward the most tactically favorable position, using full defense while calling out for parley.

It is up to the PCs whether they parley or not. If PCs attack, Bragdor fights his way to one of the doorways and defends himself there, fighting to the death if no other option is available; he only makes the parley offer once. If the PCs accept his parley offer by lowering their weapons or verbally agreeing to it, Bragdor looks around warily before lowering his club.

**Conversation:** The PCs may, if they choose, talk with the ogre. With his newfound respect for the PCs, he is happy to engage in conversation and even apologizes for any PCs that were injured or killed. Bragdor is capable of relating the details of the journey to the dungeon, the name of the orc leader (Orghar), the history and state of relations between the orcs and the other humanoids, as well as the sudden appearance of various strange beasts that attacked everyone. The exact details of such a conversation are left to the GM. Given the ogre's rather simple mind, he is incapable of giving specific details on such things as directions or anything beyond simple impressions of the beasts (caped bats, big rodents, stinging flies).

He knows that Orghar has become more evil and violent in recent months? Years? How long has it been, he wonders. But he doesn't know the source of this evil. Bragdor remains extremely scared of Orghar; the orc's concentrated malevolence left a deep impression. Whenever talking about Orghar, Bragdor checks over his shoulder to see if the orc is nearby. He tries to avoid saying the name out loud, worried it might summon him, and performs odd, superstitious little tricks with his fingers, warding off the orc's evil eye.

If explicitly asked about Longtail, Bragdor has trouble remembering who it was, and the PCs may have to jog his memory with a description. Even then, all he can share is that the "rat-man" has been gone for some time. Bragdor cannot make the connection between Longtail's absence and the appearance of the beasts in the dungeon on his own.

Once the PCs and Bragdor are done talking, they may wish to leave. He will not accompany them under any circumstances, stating that it would not be a good idea if he was seen with them because "Orghar might get mad."

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, Bragdor surprises the PCs, and no parley is allowed. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, reduce Bragdor's hit points total—he was injured from a previous fight.

## A23. Pillars of Illusion

The doors to this Room are open.

This room is even larger than the previous one, though these four large pillars seem to be made of something other than stone. There is a soft hum, clearly coming from the corners.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

The Room appears empty, and the pillars are completely non-descript. This is deceiving as the pillars are capable of generating *major image* effects. This is not evident, however, unless someone casts *detect magic* on them, at which point they radiate an elusive magical aura. What that means is the caster can tell there's magic here, but it is unclear what kind and just how much. The magic itself is disguising its power.

Should the magic be uncovered with further study, the caster knows it is illusion magic. Creating an image requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If successful, the creature can create a *major image* that acts exactly as the spell, but only in the Room.

If Bragdor in Room A22 has been dealt with, this room is a safe place to rest.

**Encounter Condition:** Haunted

### Tactics

Destroying the pillars destroys the magic.

This room was, at one time, an archive for the creatures who built this place. These pillars are magical repositories for memory. As such, the PCs can use them to piece together recent events in the region, assuming they can attune to the pillars. This requires a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a DC 14 Wisdom check. Once attuned, the PCs can command the pillars to show their stored memories–scrolling forward and backward through them as they choose. PCs can generate illusions on their own.

**Memory Visions:** If the PCs spend at least 30 minutes in the room, the pillars begin to create soundless illusions revealing angels and demons inside the prison. Nothing specific beyond a demon being escorted by angels, for instance.

Another illusion shows the appearance of Longtail and Orghar and their contentious relationship, though it does not reveal their names. There's the image of Orghar fighting reptilians and another illusion of fiendish creatures coming through cracks in the "air."

Gamemasters are welcome to give other soundless clues about Region A.

## A24. Pillars of Silence

The door to this Room is open.

Four pillars dominate the corners of this large room.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

Total quiet exists in this Room courtesy of the permanent *silence* radiated by the pillars. These effects are identical to the spell of the same name except that the effect is limited to this Room. No sound can be generated within the Room and no sound passes through the Room, so that sounds made out in the hall do not penetrate through Room A23 and vice-versa. Casting *detect magic* on the pillars reveals a faint illusion aura.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe

### Tactics

Destroying the pillars destroys the magic.

## A25-A36. The Maze

The "Maze", as the humanoids call it, is a mystery. Perhaps its maddening design kept prisoners from finding the surface. Whatever its purpose, the tight quarters, countless doors, and winding halls were a perfect reminder of home for this particular tribe of troglodytes.

Orghar had enough tactical acumen to realize that dozens of orcs could get bogged down in the "Maze" and thus, except for a small force to take Room A25, the orcs avoided the area during their final assault on the reptilians; Orghar planned to deal with the troglodytes later. Although the orcs' surprise attack managed to drive the troglodytes from Room A25, the orcs were themselves soon overrun and forced to retreat into the "Maze" by a large swarm of fiendish darkmantles that Longtail had released. Currently, the troglodytes hold the eastern Rooms in their grasp, having fought off the fiendish darkmantles in the narrow halls. They await whatever comes next.

Due to the close quarters and the effects of the troglodyte musk, this is a dangerous area for even a well-prepared party, especially near Rooms A31 through A34. Before having the PCs enter, thoroughly study this section of the dungeon.

The doors in the maze portion, that is, the doors between hallways, are all open unless otherwise indicated. Doors between hallways can open in either direction; the decision is the GM's. Note that any action that takes place within the hallways of the maze itself will be referenced in the description of the Room that is closest to the action.

---

## A25. Pillar Room

All doors to and from this Room are open.

A giant pillar, some 10 feet in diameter and rising from floor to ceiling, dominates this room. Defaced images cover every inch of the column, leaving no clue as to what they might have once been. Several open doorways lead out of the room, but they were obviously of little use to the orc corpses that litter the floor. Several bodies of reddish, leathery, octopus-like creatures are scattered about, one still attached to an orc's head.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

The images of the pillar are beyond recognition, horribly defaced. The seven orcs are remnants of Orghar's strike force sent to take this Room, killed by the swarm of fiendish darkmantles that flooded through the area. They learned too late that the extraplanar beasts are quite capable of opening doors. Examining the orcs shows that all of them have lolling tongues and bulging eyes or broken necks. They were clearly attacked by the fiendish darkmantles.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Visions

### Creatures

Currently, eight **fiendish dire rats** root through the remains for choice pieces.

Having followed the fiendish darkmantles in the hopes of picking up scraps, these fiendish dire rats are busily gorging themselves and have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the PCs' approach.

### Tactics

The moment the PCs are detected, the fiendish dire rats take up a defensive posture, arched backs, hackles up, and hissing, but they do not attack unless provoked. They are not interested in the PCs and would rather have the easy meal that is already provided than fight with a new foe. As long as the PCs leave the fiendish dire rats alone, the rats reciprocate, going back to their meals and only occasionally hissing a warning in the PCs' direction. The PCs should recognize the signs of an animal defending its territory, but if not, allow them a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check or DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) check to understand the situation.

The PCs can move about the Room as long as they avoid the fiendish dire rats. If a PC gets within 10 feet, a fiendish dire rat gives a warning snap of its teeth. If a PC gets within 5 feet, the dire rat attacks.

If it comes down to combat, the fiendish dire rats defend their territory, fighting as best they can. Individual fiendish dire rats retreat or flee if reduced to one-half hit points (or fewer). The remaining fiendish dire rats retreat if three or more of their number are killed. These rats do not pursue fleeing PCs, being more than happy to feast on the dead orcs.

### Treasure

In addition to the arms and armor (rusty scimitars, old hand axes, a cleaver, a punch dagger, a pair of sharp stilettos, a small shield, and a suit of oversized studded leather armor), PCs can find a few items of interest on the orcs with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check:

- A small block of **hack silver** (a chunk of silver from which pieces are cut to pay for items; worth 37 sp)
- A **gold nose ring** (6 gp) threaded through an orc's nostril
- A small leather bag with three pieces of **lapis lazuli** (12 gp each)
- A set of well-worn **ivory knucklebones** (3 gp)
- A **silver and gold bracelet** with images of dolphins (75 gp)
- A small, bright **golden feather** woven into one orc's hair (actually a **Quaal's Feather Token (whip)**)

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish dire rats fight to the death. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, the PCs surprise the fiendish dire rats.

## A26. The Narrow Room

The door to this Room is open.

Two naked orc corpses lie in the back of this long and narrow room, obviously the victims of the octopus-like creatures. The room is otherwise empty.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

These orcs were forced to retreat to this Room when the fiendish darkmantles attacked and were killed for their efforts. They bled out slowly from their wounds. Their weapons and armor were stripped away by troglodytes, except for one crude, unbalanced greataxe that was too heavy to carry away. The troglodytes, finally able to effectively repay the orcs, hacked up the corpses in a show of petty vengeance.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Tactics

If the PCs are here for more than 10 minutes, roll a random encounter. Under no condition is this Room a safe place to rest.

### Treasure

One of the orcs has a crude **treasure map** tattooed onto his back. It does not look like any place the PCs recognize, but the GM is encouraged to have it lead somewhere if the PCs ever escape this dungeon.

## A27. Storage Room

The door to this Room is open.

Several shovels and picks lay against one corner of the wall. A corpse, an orc by the look of it, lays in the other corner, a flying octopus attached to his head.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

Although the PCs may at first assume that the fiendish darkmantle is feeding on the orc, this is not the case. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check or simply walking up to the corpse reveals a dagger stuck in the beast's head. Out of desperation, the orc stabbed at the fiendish darkmantle with his dagger, killing the beast and himself. The orc still wears his scale armor, a battle ax at his side.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Tactics

If the characters attempt to remove the fiendish darkmantle, or the dagger, from the orc's head, the orc lurches to his feet. The prolonged effects of fiendish contamination bring him back from the dead as a **ghoul** of some sort. He attacks immediately. The orc-ghoul uses the ghoul stat block but starts with half the standard hit points and cannot use the claw's action. The transformation was interrupted by the PCs. Should the orc-ghoul kill or eat a PC or another creature, it is immediately restored to full health and gains the ability to use the claws action.

If Turag is with the party, the ghoul attacks him first.

### Treasure

Aside from the armor and battle ax, the orc-ghoul has a pouch with seven **bloodstones** (30 gp each). Any PC that takes a moment to examine the dagger or succeeds at a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices that it is of fine quality and is, in fact, a **silver dagger**.

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the ghoul's armor class, armor, attack bonus, and damage by 2. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, the orc doesn't reanimate, irrespective of the PCs' actions.

## A28. The Whimperer in Darkness

An orc corpse lies in the hallway just before the door, another victim of the fiendish darkmantles. If the PCs attempt to open the door, read the following.

Pushing against the door, you sense resistance.

If the PCs push harder, read the following.

When you push a little harder, the door moves slightly before moving back towards you as if there is resistance from the other side. Was that a whimper you heard?

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

The door is being held closed by **Turag**, an orc that managed to survive the fiendish darkmantle swarm by seeking refuge in this Room even as his fellow orc was being killed right outside the door. He is barricading the door by jamming the point of a kobold spear under the bottom and holding on for dear life.

The PCs can force open the door by succeeding at an opposed Strength check against Turag (Turag has advantage on the check due to his Strength and the leverage the spear provides). But Turag cannot hold out forever. He loses advantage after five rolls (should he succeed that long). Turag whimpers all the while the PCs try opening the door.

Once the door is forced open, Turag retreats to the northwestern corner, grasping his battleaxe and trying to look as threatening as possible, even though he is shaking with fear. A DC 8 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that the orc is clearly in no condition/mood for conflict.

**Encounter Condition:** Concealment, Cover

### Tactics

If the PCs attack Turag, he goes down fighting (see tactics below). If, on the other hand, the PCs make any friendly overtures, the orc falls to his knees, drops his battleaxe, and begins pleading with the PCs to help him escape.

Although this exchange should be role-played, the GM can resolve this through a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check, with advantage if none of the party are reptilians or extraplanar creatures. If Boyikt (Room A69) and his kobolds are accompanying the PCs, the kobolds attack Turag. Even if the check fails, Turag does nothing more than continue to try and hold off the PCs by looking as threatening as is possible in his current state; he only attacks if he is attacked.

**If the PCs Help Turag:**

If the PCs agree to help the orc, he is incredibly relieved and grateful, throwing himself at his rescuers' feet and in general being subservient. Although he is still an orc, Turag is clever enough to know that, at least at this moment, the PCs are his only way of making it out alive and will do what he can to help them; he plays up the role of the servant to the maximum. He's obsequious, eager to help, and always offering strange bits of proverbial orcish wisdom such as:

> A dead badger in your sack is better than a live one in your trousers

> Might as well kill the bastard now than regret not killing them later

> The best way to catch a goblin is firmly by the throat.

The PCs could gain an NPC retainer out of this. Conversely, if a character has recently died, someone can play Turag for a while.

Naturally, this is largely lip service, and Turag avoids doing any actual work (especially fighting) unless absolutely necessary to defend himself or if he is threatened with abandonment or bodily harm. What Turag does should the PCs encounter a group of his brethren or a powerful antagonist Turag might feel inclined to throw his lot in with is up to the GM. Having some reliable comic relief in a campaign is always a good idea. Turag's experiences in the region might be a useful way of imparting information the PCs otherwise miss. Of course, having a beloved NPC suddenly turn traitor is a dramatically effective move too. Do whatever suits your campaign best.

**If the PCs Will Not Help:**

If the PCs will not help, Turag accepts the judgment with a shrug and returns morosely to his corner. The orc does not say anything to, or respond to anything from, the PCs from that point on. However, once the PCs leave the Room, Turag stealthily follows them, dogging their steps just out of range of any light sources. He is determined to follow the only chance he has at salvation. Even if caught at this game, Turag does not give it up unless the PCs kill him. If confronted about his actions, he whines and pleads ad nauseum, making a series of increasingly implausible claims about his various talents.

**Information Turag Knows:**

Turag can relate the general events of the orc entry into the dungeon and their battles against the reptilians. He has no idea where the beasts hail from; he only knows that his small band of warriors was suddenly attacked by a huge swarm of leathery, flying, octopus things. Once in this Room, Turag took safety (he won't mention the part about barricading it against his fellow orcs) and was somehow missed in the excitement.

Turag cannot tell the PCs much of anything about the dungeon itself. Being a simple warrior he did what he was told and did not bother with the details. The previous combats with the reptilians are a blur of Room-to-Room combat and he has no actual recollection of the routes. As a result, Turag can in no way serve as a guide to the PCs as he does not know anything, and "everything looks the same anyway." That doesn't mean he won't claim to be able to guide them if he curries favor.

Asking the orc about Longtail receives little response. He only saw the "rat-man" once or twice and then only when he was talking with Orghar. He has not seen the "rat-man" in some time and has no idea what he might be up to. Turag does not make the connection between Longtail's absence and the appearance of the beasts in the dungeon on his own.

**Combat Behavior:**

If the PCs attack Turag, he fights to the death as best he can in his shaken state (consider him to have 2 levels of exhaustion).

If he joins the PCs, Turag stays out of combat, letting the PCs do all the work. He defends himself if attacked, while crying for help. If threatened by the PCs, Turag actively engages in combat to save his own skin, and then only if a PC fights beside him; he will stop the moment he is able. At no time will Turag risk his life to save or help a PC unless he feels the PCs will kill him if he does not.

Turag is a covert coward, however. He tries to be near combat sufficiently to claim involvement but not so much he might actually become involved. Afterward, he regales anyone who'll listen with all the ways he aided the party, not-so-subtly hinting their victory was really due to his assistance.

## A29. Casualties

The secret door to this Room has been wedged open with rusted equipment and orc bodies.

Close to a dozen orc bodies lie in various places about the room, along with an equal number of flying octopus creatures. Several chairs and tables are also present, no doubt scattered during the battle.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

Close to a dozen orc bodies lie in various places about the room, along with an equal number of the flying octopus creatures. Several chairs and tables are also present, no doubt scattered during the battle. Once used as a marshaling hall, the Room is presently empty except for the bodies.

Large, hungry, emboldened fire ants feed on the bodies. Consider making them into a swarm that fights the PCs if the PCs encroach on their meal.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Creatures

However, once the PCs have been inside the Room for two rounds, a **fiendish rat swarm** enters the hallway leading to this Room from the southern door and heads for the Room in search of more prey. If the PCs spend less than two rounds in the Room or simply look inside and leave, the wave enters the hallway while the PCs are still in it.

### Tactics

The fiendish rat swarm has been tracking the PCs since picking up their scent in Room A25. Although primarily scavengers, this wave is actively hunting for live flesh.

As the wave enters and rolls down the hall, allow the PCs DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) checks where appropriate in order to note its arrival.

The fiendish rat swarm's tactics are straightforward: it sweeps into Room A29 and covers the maximum number of PCs in its 10-ft. by 10-ft. area. The fiendish rat swarm fights to the death, pursuing fleeing PCs and tracking them by scent if they get out of sight.

**Blocking the Door:**

If the PCs spot the wave in time, they can push closed the door to Room A29, using their bodies to block the door and prevent the wave from entering. The wave batters unsuccessfully against the door for four or five rounds before all becomes still. If the PCs open the door at any time thereafter, the wave rushes through, having waited in silence for the PCs to do just that.

Clever PCs might think to look under the door or might succeed at a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check and notice the wave still waiting outside. In that case, the wave eventually moves off down the hallway to lurk in the shadows at the western end, waiting for the PCs to open the door and step out—at which point the swarm rushes down the hallway to attack.

### Treasure

Along with the usual orc arms and armor, a careful search of the orc bodies reveals a few spoils with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check:

- A **battleaxe** with the runes of the manufacturer engraved in the blade. This is a battle axe and is the work of the renowned dwarven weaponsmith, Dorin Steelforge
- A hunk of **amber** (11 gp)
- A necklace of teeth of various kinds (no value)
- A length of red silk ribbon tied in an orc's hair (dirty beyond cleansing and thus no value)
- Three **silver earrings** in one orc's ear (8 gp, 10 gp, and 17 gp respectively)
- A small **ivory carving of a lion** (25 gp)
- A **punching dagger** embedded in one of the fiendish darkmantles

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the secret door crushed to rubble so the PCs cannot easily block the entrance. To decrease the challenge, reduce the hit points of the fiendish rat swarm to one-half prior to the start of the encounter and/or allow it to occupy only a 5-ft. by 10-ft. area.

## A30-A36. Sick and Tired

The hallways and Rooms north of Room A30 and west of and A36 are the home of the troglodytes. PCs that enter the area are automatically considered **poisoned** the entire time they are within the area from the strong concentration of troglodyte musk that pervades the area.

They must also succeed on a **DC 11 Constitution save** when within the hallways or Rooms A31, A35, and A36. On a failed save, the PC is **nauseated** (unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention; only a single move action per turn is possible) for 1 minute, after which time they continue to be poisoned for as long as they are in the area but can no longer be nauseated. Because of the massive concentration of musk, there is no need to roll for reactions to the musk of individual troglodytes while in this area.

As the PCs pass through this area, they notice a number of fiendish darkmantle corpses (roughly one every 10 ft.) the troglodytes killed as they retreated down the hall.

The only way to eliminate the sickening effect is to leave the area (either go south of Room A29 or east of Room A36), at which point the sickening effect remains for another 1d4 rounds.

### Countering the Musk

There are a number of options for characters wishing to counter the smell:

- A rag dipped in **vinegar** (found in Rooms A5, A70, and A79), or alcohol, and worn as a mask negates the smell as it hits the PCs faces, thus eliminating the penalty
- A magic-user with a spell like *Gust of Wind* can be used to dispel the noxious musk in a room
- More reckless PCs might try and burn it out

The GM should be open to creative methods to try and overcome, or at least mitigate, the effects of the troglodyte musk.

## A30. Open Room

The door to this Room is open.

A near-naked troglodyte lies in the corner, strangulation evident on its features. Next to him lies a flying octopus creature, its body torn apart.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

The dead troglodyte was one of three on guard in this Room when the fiendish darkmantles struck. His partners managed to retreat to Room A31 and warn the troglodytes there while he fended them off. He was easy prey. The others assumed he died, but didn't stick around to find out.

If the PCs turn over the body, they find an ornate tattoo covering the troglodyte's back, from neck to ass. The tattoo is the symbol for war in the troglodyte's language. It is a symbol for protection as well and may have conferred magical defenses on him.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

### Treasure

A well-worn and crude spear lies next to the troglodyte. He possessed very little. Not even armor.

### Scaling

Consider having the tattoo leap from the troglodyte's body to a brave warrior who examines the body. It permanently grafts to his body and confers a +1 AC bonus.

## A31. A Not-So-Tasty Meal

The doors to this Room are open.

The bodies of two troglodytes lie on the floor, obviously suffocated to death. Stirges suck whatever blood remains in their desiccated corpses.

### Features

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

These troglodytes met their fate as the fiendish darkmantles swept through the area. The fiendish darkmantles are long gone, having pushed on to the western end of the "Maze."

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises

### Creatures

Currently, eight **fiendish stirges** are taking advantage of the situation and draining the corpses dry.

### Tactics

The fiendish stirges are busy feeding and are thus distracted (disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks). They do not notice any lantern/torch light until it falls upon them. Although they are feeding, the fiendish stirges are not particularly thrilled with the quality of troglodyte blood and gladly welcome a chance to feast on something tastier, namely the PCs.

Once the fiendish stirges spot the PCs, they take to the air to attack, spreading their numbers out as evenly as possible. Should the PCs gain surprise, they do not have time to mount a smart offensive and fight chaotically.

The fiendish stirges, like the PCs, suffer from the troglodyte musk in the area and are considered poisoned.

Although the fiendish stirges are hungry they are not suicidal and any fiendish stirge reduced to one-half its hit points or fewer flies back to Room A30 and from there to the east, gladly leaving its fellows behind. If at any time the odds are even or there are more PCs than fiendish stirges, the remaining fiendish stirges flee.

Because the fiendish stirges have already been feeding on troglodyte corpses, they are not hungry and only drain 5 hit points each from the PCs. Once full, they fly off to digest their meals.

**Special Stirge:** To complicate matters, one of the fiendish stirges is semi-translucent and is harder to hit. All stirges either sharing this stirge's space or adjacent to it function like *mirror images* of the stirge. In addition, it is more connected to its fiendish energy and explodes with vile ichor and blood when killed, dealing **1d6 acid damage** to all creatures within 5 ft.

### Treasure

N/A

### Scaling

To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish stirges be hungry enough to drain 20 hit points from a victim. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, have each fiendish stirge only capable of draining 5 hit points from a victim.
