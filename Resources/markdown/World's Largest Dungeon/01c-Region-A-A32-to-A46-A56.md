# Region A (continued)

## A32. TORTURE CHAMBER

The door to Room A32 is trapped. Pulling the door open releases some inexplicable radiant energy located underneath it. The radiant energy expands from a holy sigil drawn on the floor just under the door. When the door is opened, the energy spreads, hurting everyone of evil intent.

The trap is reset when the door is closed. Nothing the PCs do can permanently disarm the trap.

**Radiant Energy Trap:** Radiant light explodes out in a 60-foot cone from the sigil, searing all those of non-good alignment. DC 15 Dexterity save to avoid. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d4 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute, or half damage on a successful save and is not blinded.

Read the following once the PCs open the secret door:

> This room belies the standard, featureless rooms of the Region. Something, or someone, has transformed this large cell into a torture chamber. Several sets of wrist and ankle shackles are pinned into the stone walls. Dried pools of blood collect below each set, underlining the macabre nature of the room. Given the smell in the air, and the sheen to some of the pools of blood, it's seen recent use.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This room was converted into a torture chamber over the years, though it is unclear who made this alteration and when. The shackles are crude, pinned into the wall with rough pig iron spikes.

The room has not been entered in some time. And while the hallway is subject to troglodyte musk, the room itself is free of the odor. All of this may lead to questions from the PCs.

**Tactics:** Despite the atmosphere, the room is an excellent place for the PCs to rest.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this trap, have the radiant energy damage all non-good characters. To decrease the challenge of this trap, have it reset after one hour.

## A33-A34. THE AMBUSH

The following description covers the hallways and alcoves south of Room A33 including locations A and B. It also examines the tactics of the troglodytes defending the area. This is a complicated encounter. Remember the PCs, along with any other living non-troglodytes, are considered poisoned while in this area unless they have taken suitable precautions. Read the following carefully before proceeding.

Remember that the PCs, along with any other living non-troglodytes, are considered poisoned while in this area unless they have somehow managed to take precautions.

All four of the doors in this area are closed but not locked.

The southern door is ajar.

Having withstood the initial assault by the fiendish darkmantles, the remaining troglodytes have prepared themselves as best as they can for subsequent attacks by placing six of their number in readiness for any additional threats (two each at location B and two behind the southern door).

Read the following text once the PCs near location A:

> Signs of battle are evident, as several of the flying octopus creatures have met their end in these hallways. Their corpses have been cut open and their entrails line the floor. The smell of musk permeates the air, indicating someone must have escaped the fight.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile (Initial) or Indifferent (after PCs retreat)

**Encounter:** Over a dozen fiendish darkmantle corpses have had their tentacles and bodies sliced open. The resulting mess of blood and organs makes the floor intentionally slippery. PCs moving through the area must succeed at a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw the moment they step into location A. Failure causes them to slip and fall prone in a bloody mess.

Even if a PC avoids slipping, the noise made by moving through the coagulated blood and squishy organs is overheard by the troglodytes hiding at location B unless the PCs take specific actions to avoid this.

Should the PCs attempt to move quietly, have them make DC 16 Dexterity (Stealth) checks to see if they succeed. PCs using light sources (except for candles) are automatically detected before they reach location A.

Two troglodyte warriors hide in the darkness in each alcove — east and west. These locations are marked with a "B"; both troglodytes occupy a single square). Although they blend in as well as they can, the fact is they have nowhere to hide and are thus easily spotted by anyone who looks into either alcove and succeeds at a DC 8 Wisdom (Perception) check.

The remaining troglodytes hide behind the south door, ready to pounce. From here, they keep an eye on the hallway. They are much harder to spot, requiring a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Given the tight quarters in this area, the troglodytes realize the importance of these alcoves. The moment they become aware of movement through location A, they ready themselves. Due to their desire for surprise, the troglodytes at location B cannot warn their compatriots hiding behind the door of the PCs moving in darkness (those not using light sources but making noise at location A); if those two do not hear the PCs then they cannot react during the surprise round. All troglodytes notice any light sources in the hallway.

Unless the PCs have a way of knowing where the troglodytes are, or are especially cautious, the troglodytes gain one surprise round before initiative is rolled. The moment a PC enters the square between the two alcoves one of the troglodytes from each alcove takes a 5-ft. step and attacks with both troglodytes gaining a flanking advantage. The other troglodytes behind the door use the round to move down the hall (if they are not aware of the PCs when the troglodytes in the alcove attack then they cannot move until the first normal combat round), one behind the other, and hem the PC in position; they cannot attack until the following round.

Once combat begins, the troglodytes hold their positions with three of them engaging the PC caught between the alcoves (the two in the alcoves receiving flanking bonuses) and the other three providing backup for any troglodyte that falls. Although they secrete their musk, the smell is already so bad that it has no further effect on the PCs.

Knowing that they are trapped, the troglodytes fight to the death. They do everything they can to stop the PCs from reaching the wounded in Room A34. Given the chance, the troglodytes push the PCs back onto the darkmantle corpses, knowing the ground is slippery. They flank without exposing themselves and go for deep leg wounds when possible. During the surprise round, consider giving the troglodytes sneak attack bonuses (1st level).

Given recent history, the troglodytes consider anyone that is not a troglodyte an enemy and attack to kill, giving no quarter. Any attempt to negotiate falls on deaf ears.

If the PCs retreat, the troglodytes do not pursue, realizing they would be giving up a significant advantage by doing so. Since the rather desperate troglodytes recognize that it was not orcs or beasts attacking them, allow a DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check if the PCs speak draconic (with advantage if no troglodytes were wounded or killed during the initial ambush), and attempt a parlay after retreating.

If Turag (from Room A28) is with the PCs and the troglodytes notice him, they demand to take him as a prisoner in exchange for information. Turag, of course, is against this plan but turns even more sniveling if the PCs appear to agree to an exchange. If Turag fought against the troglodytes, there is no chance of parley, and they focus their energies on killing the orc. The PCs are seen as allies and also dispatched without mercy.

If parlay is successful, the PCs can speak to Yrkak, the troglodyte cleric from Room A34, though they are not past the alcoves. The lead troglodyte fetches him instead. The troglodytes share their own personal stories of the Region, but precious little concerning Longtail and his plans. Yrkak recalls that when he last heard of Longtail the "rat-man" was heading to the east.

If the parley fails, the troglodytes leave the PCs alone as long as they do not return. In no way do the troglodytes join with the PCs. They are busy caring for the wounded at the moment and enjoy their tactically sound position. Should the PCs render aid, they are most appreciative and offer them the acid flasks from Room A34.

Once the troglodyte warriors are healthy, the group attempts to leave the area.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, change two of the troglodytes to incensed berserkers. Their claw and bite attacks do two additional points of damage, and the first time they are reduced to 0 hit points, they make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, they stay standing with two hit points remaining. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, remove the two troglodytes behind the door. They are inside Room A34, and wounded instead.

## A33. TROGLODYTE LIVING QUARTERS

The door to this room, as are all the doors in this area, is open.

> Several troglodytes lie in a fetal position on reed mats, otherwise this room appears to be empty.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** There are a total of six dead troglodytes here, having been arranged in the proper burial positions by their cleric (see Room A34). There are no other living troglodytes in the room.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## A34. TROGLODYTE LIVING QUARTERS

The door to this room is open (as are all the doors in this section).

> Some badly wounded troglodytes lie on reed mats. Several others sit and sulk. One of them looks older and wiser, tending to the injured. In the southeastern corner is a collection of orc weapons, some armor, a pile of clothes, and a sack.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** There are a total of seven wounded troglodytes (hp 8, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0) within this room. They are casualties of the fiendish darkmantle assault and are being tended to by Yrkak, a troglodyte cleric.

Three of the wounded are incapacitated and at 0 hit points, and the other four warriors are fatigued (2 levels of exhaustion, cannot use multi-attack) as a result of their recent action and wounds.

**Note:** If the PCs rest somewhere after the ambush before entering this room, the troglodytes have had time to heal a little bit.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Yrkak is busy doing what he can for the wounded warriors and has already used his allotment of spells to fight the fiendish darkmantles. If the PCs have killed the warriors in the hall, the troglodytes see no chance for peace. The four wounded warriors engage the PCs immediately.

There is a chance for the PCs to negotiate here, but it is slim.

Yrkak kills the three disabled warriors (taking three rounds to perform the coups de grace), rather than having them fall into enemy hands. He makes a prayer to his god as he does, granting him advantage on his next three die rolls after this. The mercy killings Yrkak carries out prove to be a mistake, however. In 1d4+1 turns, the dead warriors return to life as ghouls and proceed to attack the nearest target — whether troglodyte or PC. They've been inflicted with the same fiendish contamination as the orc the PCs might have encountered earlier. Should these ghouls somehow remain in the dungeon for a month or more, they gain the fiendish template as well.

Once Yrkak has finished with the three disabled warriors, Yrkak joins any remaining warriors in combat, throwing the acid flasks at the strongest PCs. If the PCs have rested before entering the room, he has his full complement of spells restored.

Everyone fights to the death.

**Treasure:** Yrkak has an amber holy symbol of his god (100 gp) on a leather thong around his neck, a javelin, a potion of healing (which he is saving for the worst), an oil flask, and 3 acid flasks.

The troglodytes have collected a number of scavenged items from some of the dead orcs. There are some suits of leather armor, some clubs, and axes. All of it is crudely made, but valuable in a pinch should the PCs be running low on supplies.

There's also an orc pack that no one has gone through yet. It contains two bottles, 12 feet of scratchy rope, a halfling boot with a special lodestone inside, special wine in a wineskin, and a jar filled with toenails. The bottles contain a disgusting alcoholic beverage that doubles as a cure light wounds potion. Drinking it requires a Con check (DC 14). If the PC fails, he throws up the contents and the potion is wasted. Otherwise, it works normally, but tastes horrible.

The lodestone compass always points north, except when around magical areas, in which case it just spins.

The wineskin is well made and looks custom. It contains a delicious human wine that was once worth roughly 100 gp.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the wounded troglodytes be fully functional (they are still wounded but not exhausted) and increase their hit point totals by 4 each. In addition, Yrkak has not used his 2nd-level spell slots. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, make all the troglodytes exhausted and the disabled troglodytes don't return to life.

## A35. OUTER CHAMBER

This standard secret door is locked with a good lock (DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check) in the lower left corner of the door (DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check). The lock is part of the door and cannot be attacked separately. The door may only be locked or unlocked from the outside. Once the door is unlocked, it may be opened in the usual manner.

> As you push open the door, a shriveled and partly clothed skeletal body falls into the passageway.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This is the body of an orc soldier, imprisoned in this room by his fellow soldiers when his madness overtook him. He ate most of his own flesh, as can be seen by the tusk marks etched into his bones. A broken sword lies next to the door, its blade snapped.

**Encounter Condition:** Stagnant Air

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** Propped into the southwestern corner is a broken repeating light crossbow, and a smashed hooded lantern (no oil).

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## A36. MAGAZINE

The secret door is trapped to release a swinging block that hits anything within the doorway when the door is pushed open from Room A35. There are actually two such blocks, one for each side the door can be pushed in on. Only one can be triggered at a time due to the construction of the trigger mechanism which relies on the door opening into Room A36 to operate. The hidden bolt bypass for each block is located just inside the door and using it requires that the door open slowly in order to access the locking mechanism just inside the doorframe. Pushing the door closed resets the trap.

**Swinging Block Trap:** +5 to hit one target. On a hit, deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage. DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 13 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to disarm.

Once the PCs open the door, read the following:

> Several weapons, as well as barrels and cases, sit in a haphazard fashion within this room. They have clearly been ransacked, with most of the contents missing or strewn about the floor.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This was a storage room for munitions and supplies. Orghur's orcs have had their way with the contents; however, they left behind little.

**Encounter Condition:** Drafty, Extreme Cold, Safe

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** A small barrel of 88 crossbow bolts balances in one corner. Although there are racks to hold over 20 polearms, currently only three spears are here. The cases have been smashed open and emptied of their contents. A small cask of oil (5 gallons) rests on top of the barrel.

Crumbled and wedged behind the barrel is a crude troglodyte tapestry. It is painted with various shades of blood and ichor, creating a monotone image of their tribe's origin story: as the troglodytes walk up from the divine river in a line, with the first bringing gifts to an already crowned king and queen.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of the trap, raise the attack bonus of the trap to +8. To decrease the challenge of this trap, reduce the damage done by the stone block to 2d6.

---

## A37-A40. THE QUAD

Four large rooms encompass A37 through A40, serving as ancient workshops. Although most of the tools are gone (having been taken by any number of humanoid races), the large furnaces and tables are still in place.

Mostly empty, the area currently serves as a resting place for several fiendish beasts that have formed a convenient fellowship. Over the years, Achsyyx and other fiendish creatures have lured creatures here as food.

---

## A37. TOOLSMITH WORKSHOP

The door to this room is open and secured with a metal hook that holds the door in place, preventing it from accidentally closing.

> Several large workbenches are arranged in a haphazard fashion in this room. An unnatural light is cast across the floor and walls, with crooked shadows breaking the monotony. A familiar unease sets in.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent or Hostile

**Encounter:** Fiendish darkmantles, rats, and stirges have made their home here. The PCs can see from the doorway that the room is a nest for them, though it is unclear how many total monsters live here. Shadows and the scale of the room make it difficult to discern what is what. This gives all of the creatures inside a huge advantage, as they can all see in darkness.

Roll 1d6 when the PCs enter the room to see the state of the creatures and the number present.

| D6 | Encounter |
|:--:|:----------|
| 1 | One darkmantle hovers in the air, as three resting rat swarms and five buzzing stirges prepare to strike. |
| 2 | Two darkmantles cling to the ceiling (resting), as two rat swarms prepare to strike, and three stirges rest from feeding. |
| 3 | Three darkmantles hide, as three rat swarms hide rest in the corners, and one stirge waits to pounce from behind. |
| 4 | One darkmantle hovers in the air as four resting rat swarms and three buzzing stirges prepare to strike. |
| 5 | Two darkmantles cling to the ceiling (resting), as two rat swarms prepare to strike, and three stirges rest from feeding. |
| 6 | Three darkmantles hide, as two rat swarms rest in the corners, and three stirges wait to pounce from behind. |

While their tactics are not complicated (see below), the gang's makeup determines what the PCs see and hear.

Five workbenches show signs of heavy use under layers of dust. Various tools lay about the workshop, all of them either broken or in poor repair.

**Encounter Condition:** Safe, Soft Cover

**Tactics:** Combined, the darkmantles, rats, and stirges are a formidable threat to any PCs not expecting a three-pronged attack from the darkness.

In general, the darkmantles cast the room into darkness, the stirges puff themselves up to look bigger before swooping down, and the rat swarms bite at the feet and legs of the PCs surrounding them.

The darkmantles fight cleverly and do not let themselves get hurt. If they do, they fly up to the ceiling and try to disappear into the darkness. The rat swarms fight to the death, having no sense of themselves as individuals. If the stirges are wounded, they flee to one of the other workshops. All of them are opportunistic fighters, going after the weakest PCs.

Keep track of which monsters go where (Room A39 or Room A40). They may ambush or face off against the PCs again later.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the number of each monster by 1 and add two fiendish dire rats. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, reduce the number of each monster by 1 (minimum 1).

---

## A38. WEAPONSMITH WORKSHOP

The door to this room is open and secured with a metal spike that has been driven into the ground to prevent the door from being closed. A DC 15 Strength check is required to pull the spike out of the floor.

> Several large workbenches are arranged in a haphazard fashion in this room. A large furnace sits unlit in the northeastern corner.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** There are a total of eleven workbenches in this room, all of them dust-covered and showing signs of heavy use. The furnace is functional, but unless the PCs have fuel with them, it cannot be fired up. Various tools lay about the room that, if gathered together, make a set and a half of artisan tools (weaponsmith).

Upon searching the room, the PCs find words scrawled in common in the dust of one workbench. "Fire trap. Beware." The message was written by a human adventurer (Room A99), and refers to the burning hands trap in Room A46, though the PCs won't know this.

If the PCs can find a way to secure the door, this is a safe place to rest.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Consider rolling for a random encounter when the PCs enter, but not while they rest.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## A39. DESTROYED WORKSHOP

The door to this room is open and secured with an iron spike that has been driven into the wall to prevent it from being closed. A DC 15 Strength check is required to pull out the spike.

> The workbenches in this room have all been destroyed; all that remains is a furnace resting in the southwestern corner.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Whoever cleaned out this room destroyed everything with a sledgehammer, including the furnace. The mess is just the right place for eight fiendish dire rats.

Creatures fleeing from Room A37 may be found here as well.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), Concealment, Hazardous Footing 15

**Tactics:** The fiendish dire rats rummage through the morass in the room, trying to put together a nest in the furnace from the choicest bits. Although they are busy, they are still animals chewing away at bugs and filth. Regardless, one of them is likely to have an eye on the door while the others eat. It does not matter which. Sneaking up on the dire rats is difficult, especially if the PCs use a light source.

Whether or not the dire rats gain surprise, the rodents spread out to limit how many PCs can get through the doorway. The rest take defensive positions. Although they are defending their newly won home, these rodents are not eager to die and will flee if three or more of their number are killed.

Somewhere along the northern wall is a hole in the wall the size of a small dog. The dire rats can fit through it, one at a time, if they need an escape route. They might also use this to get into the hallway and then around to the door.

**Treasure:** A thorough search of the rubble reveals a bone hand (species unknown) wearing a magical signet ring. The ring hums and glows when the wearer is hungry. Once it is worn, it cannot be removed, without a remove curse spell. The PCs also find a small leather sack that has been chewed through. A few silver coins are still inside the sack, though it cannot be repaired.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add three fiendish dire rats. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, remove two fiendish dire rats.

---

## A40. DESTROYED LABORATORY

The door to this room is partially open, hanging by one hinge as the result of the explosion that ripped through this laboratory. The door blocks passage for Medium creatures (although Small creatures can squeeze through) and requires a DC 15 Strength check to open fully.

> This room was obviously devastated by an explosion. Scorch marks score the walls and whatever furniture once adorned the place is in shards. Here and there you can make out what appears to be a table or the leg of a stool, but otherwise the destruction is complete.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This was a laboratory that was destroyed during a failed experiment involving fire evocation. The entire laboratory was virtually vaporized and the door was knocked off its hinge.

The entire floor is covered in slivers of wood, chunks of stone, pieces of glass, and bone shards that halves movement and give disadvantage on Stealth checks. All of the debris is scorched in some manner and the entire place still smells of the smoke from many years ago. The remnants of a furnace sit in the northwestern corner, the explosion reducing it to little more than a pile of rubble about the height of a man's knee.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The floor is covered in debris. Sifting through the trash takes hours to find anything. The furnace, despite its almost total destruction, is a more promising area to search and any PC that succeeds at a DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a short sword that looks almost unmarked by the devastation. This is a +1 short sword that was being prepared to receive further enchantments when the research detonated.

GMs may allow the PCs to place one 1st-level enchantment or transmutation spell into the sword, completing the ritual. However, this requires a DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check to figure out what they were doing, as well as a DC 20 Arcana check to complete the ritual.

If it succeeds, such a spell would be permanently infused into the blade. The spell is then stored inside the blade to be cast once per day as a 1st-level wizard might cast the spell. Sleep, for instance, could be cast once per day by the sword, regardless of who wielded it.

Gamemasters may find this ability too powerful and instead give it 20 charges, in which case the spell eventually ends.

**Scaling:** N/A

## A41-A45. KOBOLD STRONGHOLD

Rooms A41 through A45 mark the borders of a kobold stronghold. This area was the first target of the orc's assault. As the battle in this area reached its climax, a wave of extraplanar beasts joined the fray. Even a last-second alliance between the kobolds and orcs could not stop the onslaught. Currently a number of fiendish giant beetles and snake swarms explore the area, looking for scraps and nesting places.

**Note:** The fiendish giant beetles and snakes work together right now because there is enough food to go around. As soon as the food is gone, they will turn on each other.

**Also Note:** After Room A45, it is quite possible for the PCs to make navigation choices leading them north to Region E. If the characters choose to head in that direction, make sure the PCs have some means of reaching level 4. Whatever you need to do. Place a secret door map in between and let the PCs gain some XP, or just have them wake from a rest with an additional level, if needed. Alternatively, let them experience the first encounter in Region E and flee when it becomes clear they're outmatched.

Because this is the only area where fiendish beetles and snakes are found, it has its own random encounter chart.

### Random Encounters

| D20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | The sound of nearby heavy breathing and panting is followed by a distant howl. When rolled again, the howl gets closer. |
| 2 | A dead kobold or orc lies in the hallway, recently murdered and chewed upon by rats... or something else. But the body wasn't fully consumed. Why? When rolled again, the face and hands are the only parts that have been eaten. |
| 3-8 | Nothing. When rolled again, add +1 to the roll. This bonus is cumulative. |
| 9-13 | A swarm of writhing fiendish snakes approaches, turns, and disappears into the darkness. When rolled again, the snakes turn into smoke and evaporate. |
| 14-16 | Two fiendish giant beetles feed on the remains of a fiendish darkmantle. They stop eating once the PCs approach. When rolled again, there is an additional beetle, but they feed on something else from the area. This effect is cumulative. |
| 17-20 | The PCs stumble upon an illusion. |

## A41. KOBOLD GUARD POST

The door to this room is open and damaged.

> Two dead orcs and four dead kobolds lay amidst an overturned table and broken stools. The bodies have started to decompose, their features gnawed upon. Their faces are unrecognizable and most of the fingers are gone.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This was a guardpost for the kobolds that occupied this area. The guards here were tasked with guarding the approach of anything from the "Maze." Breaking through the kobold defenses in Room A45, Orghur sent a squad of orcs through the western tunnel to deal with them. The corpses that lay here are the result of that skirmish.

Currently, three fiendish giant scarab beetles scurry along the floor and walls, feeding upon the bodies.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The fiendish beetles take a defensive stance, but do not immediately attack. The PCs may or may not recognize their behavior as a bluff. If not, allow them to make a DC 10 Wisdom (Nature) check to understand the situation. The fiendish beetles are not interested in combat and, if the PCs leave them alone, the beetles continue to feed without incident.

If the PCs attack, the fiendish beetles try to flee back to Room A44. If necessary, they fight to the death, but they would prefer to look for openings to flee.

**Treasure:** Other than the standard arms and armor and the table and stools, one of the kobolds has some gold wire (5 gp) wrapped decoratively about his horns. In addition, there is an ordinary dagger driven into the tabletop with an agate in its pommel (15 gp).

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, double the number of fiendish beetles and have them attack the PCs rather than flee. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, have the fiendish beetles flee the moment they detect the PCs.

---

## A42. KOBOLD LIVING AREA

The door to this room is broken and off its hinges. Some kind of battering ram was used to break in the door.

> Nearly a dozen orc and kobold bodies lie in this room along with a couple of the flying octopus creatures. The bar behind the door has been snapped in two and lies on the ground. Stools, reed mats, and blankets are strewn over the place along with what were probably the personal possessions of the kobolds who made this their home.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile/Unfriendly

**Encounter:** The kobolds and orcs fighting in this room were surprised and overwhelmed by the wave of fiendish snakes that rolled through the area. And although the kobolds and orcs quickly banded together, it was too late.

Currently, two swarms of fiendish snake swarms pick out the choicest morsels among the numerous corpses, though the PCs would see it as one massive writhing mass of snakes. There are other snake swarms in the area, all of them getting their fill of the meat that comes off the corpses the easiest.

Some of the bigger snakes push through orifices and hollow portions of the torsos. They even feed on some of the dead darkmantles. The rhythmic consumption of flesh continues unabated, unless the PCs intervene.

**Encounter Condition:** Concealment, Distracting Noises

**Tactics:** The fiendish snake swarm knows there are more snakes in the area.

If the PCs attack, or get too close, one fiendish snake swarm flees to Room A44, leading the PCs past the fiendish rat swarms active there if they are able. If not, they fight and hope to force an opening that will allow them to flee. Only if no other option exists do they fight to the death.

The sounds of combat attract the attention of the fiendish snake swarms in Room A44, and they rush to investigate the noise. They arrive in 1d3+1 rounds with the other swarm.

If the PCs keep their distance, the swarms keep a wary eye on the PCs, but eventually return to feeding. Should the PCs get too close, though, fighting begins.

**Note:** There is only one entrance/exit in the room. If the swarms intend to flee or get help, they must squirm past the PCs. Conversely, the GM can add holes in the walls big enough for the swarms to pass through and into the hall.

**Treasure:** Aside from several small stools and a dozen reed mats and blankets, the personal possessions of the kobolds have been strewn over the floor. They hold no value to the swarm and have been pushed aside. Some of it may have even been swallowed by the snakes.

PCs require a thorough Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 16) to locate any of the following items among the general litter and bodies — a kobold sized flute carved from a small thighbone (2 gp); a set of 26 polished stone playing pieces and game board (4 gp) stolen from a caravan; a tarnished, silver drinking cup with a dwarven inscription stating "Gretta's Cup" (5 gp); a set of nine rough carvings made from ivory depicting various swamp denizens (17 gp total value); several of the kobolds are wearing horn coverings made of gold (in the shape of a cylinder and worth 3 gp each; a total of 8); eleven gems of low value (10 gp each) found in the pouches of three kobolds.

Searching for treasure can leave the PCs distracted (disadvantage on Perception checks) during the arrival of the fiendish snake swarms from Room A44.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, have the fiendish snake swarms attack the PCs the moment they enter. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, have both swarms flee to Room A44 as soon as the PCs arrive.

---

## A43. KOBOLD CHIEF'S LIVING AREA

The door to this room is open.

> The smell of blood in this room is close to overwhelming. Kobold and orc dead, along with an almost equal number of the flying octopus creatures, lie strewn about the room. A couple of large feline bodies can be identified in one of the corners. A small sea of drying blood coats the floor like a torn carpet.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This was Borryn's, the kobold chief's quarters and it was here that the battle between the orcs and kobolds reached its climax. Even as both sides inflicted heavy casualties on each other, the fiendish darkmantles fell on them and a three-way battle was joined during which all the humanoids, including Borryn perished. Their hasty alliance managed to inflict some serious casualties on the fiendish darkmantles, leaving room for the fiendish snake swarms to move in.

So thick is the carnage in this room that any creature moving across the sticky floor must succeed at a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw every time they move more than 5 ft. on a turn or fall prone among the viscera (disadvantage on Stealth checks due to the noise made when moving through the sticky blood). PCs who fall are partially coated with blood and gore. Given the carnage in the place, not even the fiendish dire rats have ventured into the room.

Because of the massive carnage, it is impossible to tell what the room once contained. A broken table, along with seven small stools, are scattered throughout the area, as are ten reed mats and attendant blankets. The remaining items, mostly kobold personal items that had been stored in sacks, are scattered about the room amongst the bodies.

**Encounter Condition:** Decrepit, Hazardous Footing 15

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The sheer damage done to the area and the sheer mess makes locating any small valuable items a chancy proposition; the bodies still have their usual arms and armaments. Most items are crushed or so drenched in blood that they are almost unrecognizable. Still, determined PCs may search (DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check) for the following items - a silver ring set with a moonstone on an orc's hand (105 gp); six sets of the gold kobold horn caps (5 gp per each cap for a total of 60 gp); an electrum earring in a kobolds ear (3 gp); a spear that lays near Borryn; a blue coral necklace (6 gp) torn from the neck of an orc; a gold pendant in the shape of a tree (25 gp) around a kobolds throat; a pair of fine leather boots (50 gp) on the feet of an orc.

An additional item of interest is a large chest situated in the southwestern corner of the room that has an orc corpse slumped across it. This was the kobold chieftain's personal chest and is locked with an average lock (DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)); it is not trapped. It contains a bolt of purple silk (10 square yards; 100 gp), a plain gold circlet (25 gp), five sacks of copper pieces (523 cp total), two sacks of silver pieces (147 sp total), one sack of gold pieces (92 gp total), a small pouch of platinum pieces (17 pp total), and two pouches of gems (21 total gems of 4d4 gp in value).

Note that searching for treasure can leave the PCs distracted (disadvantage on Perception checks) during the arrival of the fiendish rat swarms from Room A44.

## A44. KRENSHAR STABLES

Both doors to this area are open. To the west is an opening devoid of a door.

This description assumes the PCs approach from the west. If they enter the room from the southeast, ignore the "devoid of bodies" line.

> This open area is divided by several walls into smaller individual spaces. The ceiling is extremely high as well, disappearing into the darkness. Straw is scattered across the floor, with animal dung throughout. The area is eerily devoid of bodies given the carnage in other rooms, though the smell of death is present. The sounds of something ominous can be heard around one of the many dividing walls.

**Note:** This is a complicated encounter.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Currently, there are a number of fiendish creatures in the room, keeping to their respective places but on the verge of attack.

Two fiendish snake swarms wait in the northeastern corner for the fiendish rat swarms to leave the near center of the room. Meanwhile, three fiendish darkmantles cling to the ceiling, some 80 feet in the air.

This room was used by the kobolds to stable their krenshar mounts. The kobold and mounts attempted to hold this area in the face of the orc onslaught but succeeded only in getting killed. Bloated maggots and pus-filled centipedes feed on the corpses, especially since the rats and snakes are waiting to feed.

These waves followed a fiendish darkmantle swarm that had been released by Longtail and came to this room directly from Room A108 via the one-way secret door in the western wall (see Room A108 for a complete description). Although the PCs may well decide to explore the eastern hallway, the nature of the secret door to Room A108 prevents them from entering Longtail's chapel (unless they have the tools to chip through solid rock).

Should the PCs investigate, they will find two dead krenshar, one in the northwestern portion and the other in the southeastern portion, and two dead kobolds in the doorways in the corner. It is possible the PCs have never seen anything like these creatures before. They look like deranged cat wolves without ears and spikey hair.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** All three groups are on constant guard against one another. They've been locked in a stalemate for days, waiting for the other to make a mistake. The presence of the PCs throws this balance into disarray, though. Some of the creatures will turn on the PCs, and some will turn on each other.

If the snake swarm from Room A42 has already summoned the snake swarms here, they are gone and the rat swarms have scattered to various corners of the room. In this case, the PCs are left to face the rats and darkmantles at the same time.

If the snakes haven't fled, or there are more snakes here from Room A42, the rat and snake swarms turn on one another, though some turn on the PCs as well. Should the PCs try to take advantage of the infighting, the swarms stop fighting one another and fight the PCs.

The fiendish darkmantles wait for the perfect opportunity to ambush anything that moves, whoever is weakest.

In all, this encounter is an orgy of violence that should consume a lot of PC resources.

To make matters worse, Longtail may send Achsyyx from Room A103 if he hears the commotion. If the PCs are 3rd level or higher, there is a 3 in 20 chance for Achsyyx to appear after the combat is over. Additionally, there is a 1 in 20 chance that Longtail is with him. See Rooms A103 and A104. If they do arrive, however, they are likely to fall back to a safe position after a few rounds of fighting. They are only here as a scouting operation.

Additionally, the fight may proceed long enough to draw a random encounter.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge, add one more fiendish rat swarm and one more fiendish darkmantle. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, remove all of the fiendish darkmantles, but give the PCs the impression that something could be up there.

## A45. BARRICADED HALLWAY

All the doors in and out of this hallway are open and partially damaged. They will never lock again.

> The bones of two large felines and a pair of kobolds are strewn about the hallway. Their clothing is torn. Rat carcasses litter the hallway as well. Centipedes and worms burrow through the remains. Makeshift barricades and battlements are nothing but splintered wood now. But what was once an important front line is nothing now.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Protruding from the skull of the larger kobold is a crude, oversized knitting needle. It was improvised as a weapon during the fight by an orc and left there. The kobold weapons were stolen and taken back with the surviving orcs.

This room was under constant patrol and defense by two kobolds and two krenshars when the orcs attacked. Arriving simultaneously from both the east and west, the orcs slaughtered the kobold guards, sustaining no casualties themselves and leaving the bodies as a message to the others. The fiendish rat swarms came to feed on what remained, having their way with the corpses, but they too died when orcs returned to retrieve their dead.

Now, maggots and vile-looking centipedes worm through the flesh of the dead, just like in Room A44.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

## A46-A56. NO MAN'S LAND

Covering Rooms A46 through A56, this core portion of the Region was not claimed by the orcs or reptilians and served as neutral ground — when the alliance was held. It was simply a pragmatic matter to deem the area free of hostilities, lest everyone perpetually have knives to their figurative throats.

Although some parts of the area did see heavy fighting — no treaty is perfect — large parts of this area were left alone for a long time. A number of undiscovered secrets, traps, and treasures remain.
