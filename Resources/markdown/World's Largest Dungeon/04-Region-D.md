# Region D

Region D . The Tartarean 
Depths of the Xill Master
Chtrax is a diabolic xill of such caliber that his so-
ciety willingly cast him out to wander the planes 
for the remainder of eternity. Desperately seeking 
revenge, the xill searched for a good way to destroy 
his people outright. During his roamings, he came 
upon information which confirmed the existence of 
a malevolent, exiled god, Asrakhor the Undying, a 
terrible threat to the stability of the planes if freed. 
He understood from the depths of his madness that 
Asrakhor could help him get his revenge, but he did 
not know where to find him. All his searching yielded 
no clues, no evidence, nothing concrete enough to 
substantiate its existence.
The only way to reach this god, Chtrax realized, was 
through the mighty power of a wish spell. Moreover, 
the xill knew where he could find one at minimal 
cost. Aware of the world’s largest dungeon, and its 
original purpose, he suspected the devil’s vault still 
contained a powerful pit fiend named Kator. If Chtrax 
could see this beast, he was certain he could gain the 
wish. A mad plan to be certain, Chtrax has been espe-
cially careful not to reveal the truth behind his goals, 
for he knows breaching the walls of the vault would 
surely result in the deaths of all his servants.
The wicked xill traveled a myriad of Material 
Planes, but for all his searching, he could not locate 
the place, though many had heard of it, and several 
dusty tomes spoke eloquently of it. ln frustration, 
he tortured and maimed many a sage and scholar 
in his efforts to locate the massive complex. Final-
ly, one brutalized soul gave him a name – Allmnan. 
Even Chtrax had heard of this ancient lore master, 
but he had believed, like most beings in the planes, 
the old man to be dead. He quickly tracked down the 
sage, finding him deep within the Astral Plane. After 
torturing the old man for two years, the sage finally 
revealed the location of the dungeon. Not trusting 
the information, Chtrax took the crippled scholar 
with him. When they finally reached the sprawling 
complex, he killed the old man and left his bones to 
rot on the surface, before descending into the dun-
geon’s tunnels.
Unable to locate the vault on his own, he suspected 
it remained concealed and intact. He also realized he 
could never hope to uncover the vault on his own, 
as the labor would be too overwhelming for just one 
creature, so he turned to the derro for assistance. In 
their warrens, they had uncovered extensive veins 
of truesilver, a substance especially useful for con-
trolling and containing devils, and deposits of ada-
mantine – two things Chtrax knew the celestials used 
to create the vault holding the fiends. With the recent 
geological instability, more and more clues revealed 
themselves to the malicious, self-serving xill, turning 
suspicion into solid evidence.
Before the inevitable assumption of control over 
the mad derro, Chtrax approached a trapped formian 
queen. Weakened and injured from a costly war with 
the derro, and desperate to be back in touch with 
the hive on her native plane, the xill’s honeyed words 
swayed her, and she agreed to transfer control over 
her most trusted myrmarchs in exchange for her 
freedom. The xill lied, of course, and murdered her 
in the shadows of an obscure cave with her eggs all 
around her, stealing her essence and trapping it in a 
special phylactery.
Considering the unusual nature of the region, 
Chtrax organized his minions with brutal efficiency. 
He commands the entire operation, answering to 
none. Serving him are three formian myrmarchs, 
each with specific duties. The only resistance to his 
authority comes from a rebel derro, the savant Souiji.
The first myrmarch oversees security of the min-
ing outfit and truesilver extraction in the Great Hall. 
Chtrax, not content with the truesilver extracted by 
the other myrmarch’s crews, started drilling into 
the Great Hall for more truesilver, entrusting this 
operation to the first myrmarch, in addition to his 
responsibilities for security. In fact, the Great Hall 
has transformed from this region’s central nervous 
system to a massive drill, refinement and transporta-
tion site. Hence, security is thinner there than it was, 
just a few short weeks ago. He also procures stone 
golems from the gnome, positioning the golems at 
checkpoints throughout the complex, and maintain-
ing existing ones. Finally, he has a squad of formian 
warriors serving him, some of whom ride gorgons. 
These guards oversee extraction caverns, patrol the 

276
tunnels, and ensure traps and sentry towers are in 
working order.
The second myrmarch controls the security and 
excavation of the northern mines. With the recent 
waves of plague and rogue xill ambushes, the place 
has collapsed into chaos. Furthermore, the myrmarch 
here does not trust the xill master, and bides his time, 
waiting for proof of his suspicions to surface. Most of 
the remaining labor there works to build a giant bore 
to expedite mining. 
The last myrmarch oversees excavation. A typi-
cal extraction crew consists of a taskmaster, derro 
leaders, a lesser savant, three handler crew and three 
teams. Each group of handlers control one of the fol-
lowing: bulette, destrachan or yrthak. Each monster 
digging team crushes the rocks, and the teams are 
responsible for removing the rubble. Two teams are 
composed of a grimlock foreman and duergar slaves, 
who clear away much of the debris created by the 
handler crews. The third team consist of a grimlock 
foreman and deep dwarf sounders. This crew uses a 
magic device created by the evil gnome to test the 
depth of the rock, search for dead caves, and material 
compositional changes. Their efforts are hazardous 
and futile; it’s dangerous to use the device because 
it occasionally unleashes crackling electricity, almost 
always vaporizing a slave or two; it is futile because 
the device only has an accurate range of about 5 to 10 
ft. due to the vault’s inherent warping nature.
Fortunately, the recent collapses and instability of 
their excavations severely reduced the derro’s com-
mand structure, allowing Chtrax to easily ingratiate 
himself, slipping past the paranoia and the xenopho-
bia that describes the psychology of this degenerate 
race. He rose quickly through the ranks to become 
the trusted advisor to the only remaining high savant, 
eventually supplanting the leader and taking control 
of the entire region. 
Chtrax amassed a large excavation force. The derro 
captured duergar and deep dwarves to serve as slaves. 
A legion of destrachan and several yrthak act as living 
tools to wear away the rock with their sonic attacks, 
while the formians offer security and additional labor 
for digging. The derro high savant tenuously controls 
a tarrasque, urging it to break through the bands of 
adamantine warding the vault. Chtrax has also gained 
the help from Korus, a particularly evil gnome who, 
though cruel enough to appreciate Chtrax’s plan, is 
not worthy in the xill’s eyes to be in possession of 
such guarded information. The gnome produces the 
wailing guardians, stone golems capable of creating 
a terrific noise, regular stone golems, tools to handle 
the truesilver, and all manner of other mining equip-
ment. Finally, Chtrax secretly injects eggs into the 
derro and slaves to replace his flawed subjects with 
reliable xill.
The warping effects of the vault impede divination 
spells, and even go so far as to disrupt magnetic im-
pulses rendering mechanical direction sense useless 
and confusing those with a propensity for navigation. 
For these reasons, Chtrax commands the workers to 
tunnel through the whole place. He knows the vault is 
close, but exactly where, he cannot say. The desperate 
digging undermines the entire complex, destabilizing 
it. Earthquakes ripple through the place, along with 
the aftershocks, collapsing tunnels and killing more 
slaves and servants daily. Each collapse sets back the 
operation, as Chtrax must commit labor to building 
and rebuilding retaining walls to allow the excavation 
to continue. Despite the losses, Chtrax is committed 
to uncovering the vault, capturing the pit fiend and 
discovering for himself where the dark god lies.
HIVE MIND
Formians normally share a collective consciousness 
when within 50 miles of the formian queen, 
allowing them to react to danger as if they all faced 
it simultaneously. Chtrax realized if he killed the 
formian queen, the formians would be useless to him 
and they would be aware of their queen’s death. To 
galvanize his command over these outsiders, Chtrax 
trapped her essence in special phylactery, which 
allows the formians to communicate through the 
myrmarchs, but only to the extent of their respective 
sections. Though the hive mind is intact, albeit to a 
lesser extent than before, the myrmarch would have 
been understandably suspicious, if it were nor for the 
queen’s mental missive to her minions commanding 
them to serve the xill. Now, the queen retains a 
presence in the minds of the myrmarchs, but it is 
only an echo from the past.

277
If a myrmarch controls a section, its death confuses 
the remaining formians, imposing disadvantage to 
all attacks, saves and checks. In addition, they lose 
access to their hive mind ability. If the PCs shatter the 
phylactery, the formians realize Chtrax duped them, 
and fight against Chtrax and his minions, turning on 
slaves, derro, giants and PCs. For more details, see 
Room D49 in the Great Hall.
XILL EGGS AND THE DERRO
Chtrax injected eggs into the derro and slaves serving 
him. Consequently, the derro and dwarf population is 
on the decline, as more and more of these outsiders 
hatch. Left alone, xill would eventually replace all the 
derro and slaves, being a far more disciplined work 
force for the evil master.
This affliction has interesting side effects. Whenever 
the PCs encounter a derro or dwarf, there is a 25% 
chance the creature is host for a xill egg. Infected 
derro and dwarves are at risk of premature hatching 
whenever they take damage. When the infected’s hit 
points fall below half their normal total, roll 1d20. If 
the result is more than his hit point total, a full-grown 
xill immediately erupts out of its host’s chest, killing 
him in the process. The xill spends 1 round assessing 
its situation before attacking the nearest non-derro. 
Any dwarf slaves witnessing the “birth,” must succeed 
DC 15 Wisdom saves or become frightened for 1d4 
minutes – derro see a xill hatching as a sign of their 
foul goddess’ blessing.
CONSTANT EFFECTS
The proximity to the vault makes negotiating these 
tunnels a challenge. The magical emanations have a 
warping effect on magnetic north, imposing dis-
advantage on all Wisdom (Survival) checks made to 
determine direction, Wisdom (Perception) checks to 
determine approximate depth below ground, and any 
other check involving navigating the depths.
The warping field extends to magic too; spells 
determining direction (locate object, for example) 
automatically fail. Worse, it effectively impedes all 
other divination spells. Whenever a spellcaster casts 
a divination spell, that caster must succeed at an 
Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 20 + the spell’s level) 
or the spell is lost. In addition, the field immediately 
deals 3d12 psychic damage to the caster and drains 
2d6 spell slots (starting with the highest), as unset-
tling images of devils standing in a sea of blood beat 
against walls or some invisible barrier. If the caster 
succeeds, the spell dissipates without effect, and they 
become aware of something ominous.
Given these impediments, neither Chtrax nor his 
minions have any sense of where they dig, causing 
them to backtrack, dig towards the lava, up or down, 
just about in any direction. Moreover, because of the 
haphazard digging, the entire complex is unstable. 
Each hour the PCs spend in this region, there is a 
10% chance of an earthquake, as per the spell, cen-
tered on their position (save DC 19).
Finally, all rooms are dark unless otherwise noted. 
The creatures here are accustomed to working in total 
darkness. The gnome designed a special alchemi-
cal material lighting areas without affecting other 
creatures with light sensitivity, thereby allowing a few 
creatures to work alongside the duergar and derro.

278
A Race Against Time
Chtrax is close to achieving his goals. Every day, his servants come closer to stumbling across the 
vault. The region is highly organized, but the unusual permutations emitted by the vault distort 
and confound their magical efforts to locate it. The likelihood of its discovery is random; no effort, 
aside from random continued digging, can guarantee its breach. Realizing this, Chtrax commands 
his forces to dig. Their perseverance should ultimately result in the discovery and consequent 
breech of the unholy tomb, releasing the devils into the world once more.
TIMELINE
Day 0: PCs enter the derro mines.
Day 1: Nothing
Day 2: Derro miners in Room D22 break through to Room D27. The stone giant chief leads a force 
and exterminates the derro, slaves and beasts in the Old Mines except those derro in Room D19.
Day 3: Tarrasque reaches the first adamantine bands. All surviving formian warriors and gorgons 
move to Room D58.
Day 4: Tarrasque breaches first band. 
Day 5: Tarrasque breaches second band. 
Day 6: Guards and wards effect in the Old Mines ends. Tarrasque breaches the third band.
Day 7: Tarrasque breaches the vault itself, unleashing the hordes of devils contained within.
Day 12: The miners at Room D79 breach the vault, if the tarrasque does not.
The derro and the monsters serving them dig- unworked stone. To reflect the progress through 
most of these rooms, expect the depth of each tunnel to continue 10 ft. each day, except in rooms 
near the tomb (Room D59 though Room D63, Room D78 to Room D80). These rooms are magi-
cally treated and require the tarrasque for much of the digging. In these rooms, mark progress by 
5 ft. each day. Once the tunnels cross an existing tunnel the digging stops and the formian myr-
marchs redistributed crews to other rooms. 
Three days after the PCs first enter the complex the tarrasque reaches the adamantine bands 
(see the Tomb of the Devils). When this happens, Chtrax realizes he is close to his objective. At this 
point, he moves all formian warriors and gorgons from their respective locations to Room D58, 
letting those unsupervised crews do as they wish. The tarrasque breaches one adamantine band 
per day, finally cracking the vault and releasing the devils into the region. 
The PCs have about seven days to stop Chtrax and his minions from achieving their goals. It 
is important to convey urgency, but without directly telling them what is afoot. While there are 
clues through the locations, feel free to add details to keep the PCs on track. If the PCs fail to stop 
Chtrax, the devils break free and pour through the tunnels, bent on killing and enslaving. For 
details on the devil’s actions if they break free from their prison, consult the Introduction to the 
Vault, below.

279
D1- D6 . FOREBODING
D1 . SENTRY TOWER
Standing on the broken plain is a 100 ft. tower. 
Instead of a roof, a large spike bears the impaled 
effigy of an unrecognizable humanoid. Three bas-
reliefs of demonic faces decorate the surface of the 
structure. On the brows of each of the faces is a 
bright blue, red and yellow gemstone, each about 
a foot in diameter. Aside from the opened maws 
spilling reddish fluid, perhaps blood, there are no 
entrances into the building. A few scattered piles 
of broken bones litter the immediate vicinity, some 
partly submerged in the crimson runoff.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This encounter refers to all three watch-
towers positioned at the perimeter of the derro 
mines. Derro savants created these towers to deter 
unwarned attention. With the towers complete and 
the savant derro dead from the flooding, Chtrax 
commanded his gnome servant to upgrade each of 
them. The gnome constructed special stone golems 
for the derro, placed on a spike, making the golem 
appear to be nothing more than part of the struc-
ture’s obscene decor. Unlike normal stone golems, 
the gnome used petrified humanoids created by 
gorgon guards instead of a single block of granite, 
and their forms are visible in the golem’s bodies.
When the heroes approach within 100 ft. of 
the towers, allow each of them to make a DC 20 
Wisdom (Perception) check. A successful check in-
dicates scorch marks and deep impressions on the 
plain approaching the tower. 
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The tower itself is a proximity trap. The tower 
targets any non-derro approaching within 100 ft. 
with one of the following spells once each round: 
fireball, lightning bolt or ice storm. The tower can 
use each spell once per day (save DC 16). The spell 
resets in 24 hours.
Once the tower exhausts its spells, the impaled 
golem at the tower’s top animates and pulls itself 
off from the spike in a grisly display. Once on the 
ground, it moves to attack PCs within 100 ft. of the 
tower. If the PCs retreat beyond the tower’ range, 
or fall into the lava, the stone golem remains at 
the perimeter for 1d8 minutes before returning to 
the tower.
Treasure: Scattered about the plain are bits of cloth-
ing, bone and the remains of others who thought 
to approach the complex. PCs may search the room 
and find a few valuables left by the fallen. The PCs 
discover one item every 10 minutes they spend 
searching: a gem worth 10d10 x 10 gp, a +1 truesil-
ver melee weapon, a random potion, or a random 
minor wondrous item.
After finding all four items, or after 40 minutes 
of searching, the PCs find nothing else.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the wailing golem activate immediately and 
allow the tower to use each spell twice per day. To 
decrease the challenge, the tower can use one of 
the listed spells, once per day.
D2 . STATUE OF SUPPLICATION
At the edge of the rocky outcropping kneels a statue 
of a man carved from grey stone. Much of its body 
is worn and chipped, seemingly ancient. Its head 
hangs on its chest, perhaps in prayer or sleep, 
concealing its facial features for the most part. 
Behind it rise three stone mounds. Broken stone, 
trash and other debris litter the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The statue is a stone golem (see Room 
D1). The derro in Room D3 positioned the golem 
here to warn off any intruders. Unfortunately, this 
golem is old and unreliable, being a prototype for 
those on the sentry towers. It does not function 
properly and only notices intruders half of the time. 
Chtrax, lacking the inclination or the resources to 
construct a replacement, temporarily positioned 
several derro guards in a hollow pillar of rock 
(see Room D3 for details) to reinforce the weak-
ened defenses.
Encounter Condition: Fear 18
Tactics: When the PCs step onto the landing, the 
golem rolls a DC 10 Wisdom check to notice. If it 
fails the check, it does not animate unless the PC 

280
touches it, in which case it immediately ani-
mates. Due to the golem’s age, it sometimes 
gets confused. Each round, the golem must 
make a DC 10 Wisdom check or suffer the 
effects of confusion for the round. If not con-
fused, it attacks with slow, catching as many 
PCs as it can. On the next round, it grabs a 
slowed PC and hurls them into the smoking 
lava below. 
This construct is under orders to fight to 
the death. 
The wailing attracts the attention of the 
derro guards in Room D3. One of the der-
ro activates the trap at Room D6, while his 
comrades ready their light crossbows. On the 
second round of combat, the derro target the 
PCs with poisoned bolts.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this en-
counter, add one wailing golem. To decrease 
the challenge, reduce the number of derro by 
2 or increase the time it takes them to re-
spond to 1d3 rounds.
D3 . TOWER OF DEATH
This irregular mound of stone is 25 ft. thick 
and 25 ft. high. Patches of multicolored fungus 
cling to its surface. Dark clefts and pits in the 
mound of rock are common higher up, and 
several webs with scuttling spiders fill the 
smaller holes.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This mound of stone is hollow. A 
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals 
a false stone, when pressed, opens a secret 
door. On the inside of the mound stands a 
complex arrangement of scaffolding allowing 
access to the innumerable arrow slits over-
looking the entire landing.
Ten derro guards man this watch tower. 
Chtrax positioned these unruly guards here 
to serve dual purposes. First, he wanted to en-
sure the golem functioned properly at Room 
D2, and if not, have a failsafe sentry. Second, 
confident the golem works, Chtrax wanted 
to remove these troublesome derro from the 
main operation.
TRUESILVER
Truesilver is a scarce and unusual alloy of mithral 
and silver. Nearly never worked, truesilver loses 
its special properties, becoming normal silver, if 
ever touched by a creature other than an aberra-
tion or fiend. If forged into tools, the metal is just 
as good as steel. Furthermore, wholly or partially 
constructed truesilver enhances magic items 
with spell effects from the enchantment school, 
increasing save DCs for these spell effects by +2.
Weapons or armor fashioned from truesilver are 
always masterwork and confer a nonmagical +1 
bonus to attack and damage rolls, and a +1 bonus 
to the armor or shields armor bonus to AC. The 
masterwork cost is included in the prices listed 
below.
Truesilver is also useful as a material compo-
nent for casting spells with the good descriptor. 
A caster may add 25 gp of truesilver per spell level 
as a material component to any good spell he 
casts. Doing so increases the spell save DC and 
spell attack bonus by +1 each. Truesilver is also an 
exceptional material for constructing holy weap-
ons, for it takes good spells easier than other ma-
terials during the enchanting process. A properly 
crafted holy symbol (GM decides requirements, 
crafting DC, etc.) grants a +2 to spell save DCs 
when used to cast a cleric spell (this effect does 
not stack with the bonus from expending 25 gp of 
truesilver mentioned above).
Truesilver weapons also deal an extra +1d6 
damage against evil creatures.

281
Each derro knows some portion of the xill’s 
plan, but none are smart enough to understand 
the significance. As no derro trusts the other, they 
have not collaborated to compare what they have 
learned. To make matters worse, the Chtrax im-
pregnated them before exiling them to this remote 
tower. The master of the mines assumes the young 
xill will take care of the problem for him.
Encounter Condition: Fear 18
Tactics: The derro are not especially watchful and 
are lax about their duties. They spend most of their 
time arguing with each other or muttering madly to 
themselves in their darkened corners. Assume the 
derro are not looking or listening for intruders, as 
they expect the golem to alert them to trouble.
If the PCs open the secret door, make a loud 
noise outside, or do anything to draw attention, the 
derro rouse from their bickering and attack PCs us-
ing heavy repeating crossbows and poisoned bolts. 
One derro activates the trap at Room D6 by pulling 
a lever and joins his comrades in shooting the PCs 
on the following round.
The arrow slits give the derro improved cover, 
granting a +8 bonus to AC and Dexterity saves and 
a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks. There are 
so many arrow slits the derro can attack virtually 
any target with line of sight to the hollowed tow-
er. Despite their isolation and exiled status, these 
derro are as crazy as any other derro, fighting to 
the death.
Should the PCs avoid this encounter and return 
later, a xill replaces one derro for each passing day.
Treasure: Inside the tower are four large barrels of 
water. There is also a ceramic pot filled with black 
adder venom (+2d6 poison damage), enough to 
coat 20 bolts.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the sneak attack damage of the derro by 
+1d6. To decrease the challenge, reduce the number 
of derro by 2.
D4 . MAD SCRAWL
This column of stone reaches 30 ft. high before 
tapering off into a sharp break. It is apparent 
this structure was once taller as evidenced by the 
debris and rubble littering the place. Otherwise, the 
mound appears commonplace.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This earthen column, along with Room 
D5, once supported a roof, but the recent instability 
of the caverns caused it to collapse, littering this 
room with debris. The uncertain flooring and debris 
cuts movement in half. PCs investigating the room 
notice with a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check 
graffiti on the southern face of the pillar. PCs capa-
ble of reading Undercommon make out the follow-
ing words: “Hurt,” “Help me,” “It’s inside,” “Curse 
all my traitorous brothers and their foul master!” A 
fleeing duergar driven mad by his captivity found 
he could not escape the lava flow, and so in resig-
nation, carved words onto the surface of the pillar. 
The xill egg inside him burst and the xill consumed 
his body, dumping the bones into the lava before 
wandering through the uninhabited mines.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 6
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A

282
D5 . TRAPPED COLUMN
This tower of rock extends upward some thirty feet, 
where it still supports part of the collapsed ceiling 
once sheltering this place. Rubble and bone line 
the floor, making the footing uncertain. Something 
metallic on the eastern side of this column reflects 
the light emitted by the lava.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The metallic sheen originates from a per-
manent image (DC 20 Wisdom save disbelieves) of 
a longsword stuck into the rock. The sword is a lure 
to ensnare the foolish and greedy, for just above the 
illusion is a glyph of warding (explosive runes).
 '
Glyph of Warding Trap. DC 22 Wisdom (Investi-
gation) or Intelligence (Arcana) check to notice, 
DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disable. 8d8 
thunder damage to all targets within 5 ft. Dexterity 
save DC 17.
Encounter Condition: Drafty
Tactics: If the golem or the PCs actions did not alert 
the derro in Room D3, triggering the glyph alerts 
them. The derro respond as described in Room D3, 
activating the trap at Room D6, and firing poisoned 
bolts at the PCs from positions of improved cover.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the trap damage to 10d8. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the damage to 5d8.
D6. Trapped Gate
In the center of the convex surface of unworked 
stone is 10-ft-wide portal opening into an immense 
gallery. On either side of the gate, bas reliefs of 
derro push towards the opening as if trying to 
shut it. The lintel features bleached and cracked 
white skulls sitting in a row stop the whole width 
of the gate.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Unless the PCs alert or otherwise engage 
the derro at Room D3, the trap in this gate does not 
function. The derro leave the gate trap disengaged 
because it kills indiscriminately, and instead of kill-
ing their replacements, they opt to leave it disabled. 
However, combat with the derro guarantees the 
activation of the trap. The trap activates whenever 
anyone steps though the gate, causing the walls 
to slam shut, pulping anyone caught between. 
The gate automatically resets after each attack, so 
should someone remain in the room, it triggers 
again, dealing damage once more. The gate con-
tinues to slam shut and reset as long as anything 
occupies the room.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs move past the tower of death, 
Room D3, and the derro inside are aware of them, 
the derro activate this trap in the hope of past-
ing a few of the invaders, while peppering them 
with arrows.
The slamming gate creates a lot of noise, certain 
to attract wandering monsters. Immediately roll for 
a Random Encounter each time the trap activates.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the crushing gate trap to 
22d8. To decrease the challenge, have the trap jam 
after the second activation.
 '
Crushing Gate Trap.  Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Percep-
tion); Disable: DC 15 Dexterity; Characters trigger-
ing the trap must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving 
throw or suffer 63 (18d6) bludgeoning damage. A 
successful saving throw results in half damage.

283
D7- D20 . OLD MINES
Derro rebels control this area, and their racial mad-
ness has worsened in isolation, making them excep-
tionally paranoid and delusional. Souiji, the derro’s 
savant, sporadically sends out raiding parties into 
sections controlled by Chtrax to kill formians, derro 
slaves, and anything else getting in their way. The 
rebels use hit-and-run tactics to avoid capture know-
ing, despite their madness, they are far outnumbered.
The derro have trapped all the corridors leading to 
their warrens. The traps here are vicious, resulting in 
countless formian deaths. There are signs of formian 
remains throughout; their heads decorate the tunnels 
as grisly trophies.
Souiji leads these derro in their guerrilla war. Delu-
sional beyond all the rest, he trusts no one, not even 
his fellow rebels. Once a week he sacrificed one of his 
servants to the goddess of the derro in a futile effort 
to forestall the inevitable demise they all face when 
the xill eggs inside them hatch. Souiji stole a map of 
warding (see Room D19) from Chtrax before fleeing 
from the Great Hall. He uses it at the start of each 
day but unfortunately it has only six charges left so he 
knows his time is running out. The effects of the spell 
cover all encounter rooms, from Room D8 to Room 
D24 with particular effects, included in the encounter 
below. Souiji has six charges starting on Day 0, and 
all effects attributed to the guards and wards spell 
end on Day 6.
If the PCs have not vanquished Souiji and his min-
ions by Day 2, the miners in Room D22 accidentally 
break through the wall to Room D27. The stone giant 
chief in this uncovered room leads an expedition to 
kill the rogue derro, along with three additional stone 
giants, a formian taskmaster with two dominated de-
strachans and three formian warriors. Inside the old 
tunnel, the giants quickly dispatch all derro they find 
there and establish three stone giants as guards. The 
giants then invade Souiji’s sanctuary on Day 6, killing 
the savant and his remaining minions. Alternatively, 
if the PCs dispatch the stone giant chief in Room D27 
before destroying the rebel derro, the miners conceal 
the breach and use this exit to mount raids through-
out the rest of the complex. 
All rooms here are dark unless otherwise specified. 
In addition, a dense fog fills Room D8 through Room 
D24, providing half cover to all those within the shift-
ing mists, and reducing vision, including darkvision, 
to 10 ft The air stinks of rot. The walls are unworked 
stone and the ceiling averages 10 ft in height, while 
smaller, narrow tunnels are only 5 ft tall. Bones, trash, 
metal scraps and spider webs litter the corridors and 
rooms, making charging impossible and forcing PCs 
to succeed a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check for 
run actions.

D7 . OLD DERRO ENCAMPMENT
This massive gallery houses the ruins of an ancient 
village. The building that once filled this room now 
stands in ruins, shattered by chunks of fallen rock 
and massive stalactites. Pools of brackish water 
glisten in the darkness and overhead you see the 
tips of more stalactites emerging from the darkness 
of the concealed ceiling. Tunnels lead off into the 
fog-filled darkness as distant grinding noises echo 
from one of the corridors ahead.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room lies in utter ruin, destroyed 
by the flooding and earthquakes that ravaged the 
entire complex. Individual buildings lay shattered, 
preventing entry altogether. Random Encounters 
in this room should be more frequent than rec-
ommended, as wandering creatures are prone to 
be here as they move to the other mines. Roll for 
Random Encounters every 15 minutes.
Searching the ruins uncovers the remains of 
derro. Most of the corpses are skeletal but some are 
preserved. In addition to the bodies of the derro 
there are bones of a destrachan, a few duegar, and 
even a stone giant. Most of the corpses lack the ca-
pacity to speak if subject to speak with dead though 
the preserved corpses could impart the following 
with the appropriate questions.
What happened in this room? The goddess grew 
angry and flooded our mines with her tears (Insta-
bility of the caverns caused a lake from above to 
flood the caverns decade ago).
Where are the derro now? Dead. (As far as the 
corpses know the flood wiped out all of the derro.)
What were you digging for? I do not know. (The 
derro savants commanded their followers to dig, 
after receiving an enigmatic vision. With their de-
struction, their original motives are now lost.)
The corpses’ responses to any other questions 
result in confusion or ignorance.
PCs tracking and succeeding a DC 5 Wisdom 
(Survival) check identify significant traffic from the 
north to the south. A DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) 
check indicates light traffic to the southwest tunnel.
Encounter Condition: Drafty
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs searching the ruins may uncover trea-
sure in addition to the moldering corpses and trash. 
If a PC devotes an hour to searching and succeeds a 
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, he finds one of 
the following items: an arcane scroll (darkvision, fly), 
flawed sapphire (635 gp) and a pair of gauntlets of 
ogre power.
It is possible for the PCs to uncover more 
treasure, but the likelihood of searching this room 
unmolested is slim. In addition to the increased 
likelihood of Random Encounters, searching this 
room is noisy, so roll for an additional Random 
Encounter. After 30 minutes and whenever the PCs 
make a loud noise, subtract 1 from the roll (min-
imum of 1).

D8 . TRAPPED HALLWAY
Fog fills this corridor, muting light, and making 
footing uncertain. Broken spider webs hang from 
the ceiling, and bones litter the floor. The corridor 
extends as far as you can see. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Halfway down this tunnel, 30 ft. from 
the entrance, is a large hole in the ceiling. Several 
weeks ago, a pair of derro miners uncovered an 
unusual lump of stone covered in runes. One of 
them foolishly traced the rune and found himself 
splattered on the ceiling far above, having unlocked 
the stone’s reverse gravity effect. Souiji saw this find 
as a boon granted by the derro goddess. Exper-
imentation with the stone revealed he could not 
deactivate it, but he devised a way to put its magical 
properties to work.
The exiled savant commanded miners to dig a 40 
ft hole in the ceiling of the entrance corridor. With 
sovereign glue, Souiji affixed metal rungs to the wall 
beneath, and glued the enchanted rock at the top of 
the hole in the ceiling. Every morning, he places a 
magic mouth in the pit through his casting of guards 
and wards. The result of his ingenuity is a permanent 
trap functioning to ensnare enemies and alert the 
derro to intruders.
Earlier a destrachan had the misfortune to find 
itself ensnared by the trap. In its frustration, it used 
its destructive harmonics to blast away at the walls of 
its imprisonment. Its rage made escape all the more 

285
difficult. By the time the PCs discover the reverse pit 
trap, the destrachan is enraged, ready to kill. It lashes 
out at anyone who passes beneath it or falls inside.
 '
Reverse Gravity Pit Trap. Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 20 Dexterity; DC 20 Dexterity 
saving throw to avoid the trap or suffer the spell 
effect (reverse gravity) and suffer 14 (4d6) bludgeon-
ing damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Secretly make a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check for any PCs moving 25 ft. down the corridor. 
A successful check indicates the PC notices a series 
of metal rungs set into the western wall. PCs who 
see the rungs may bypass the trap easily. However, 
the destrachan with blindsight attacks the PC with 
its destructive harmonics attack. PCs falling into 
the pit must contend with the enraged monster as 
well as risking damage from the fall. Trapped PCs 
can climb up the walls to escape the ceiling pit by 
succeeding a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.
A PC hitting the bottom of the pit triggers the 
magic mouth created by the guards and wards 
spell. It babbles in a terrifically loud voice “There 
are intruders invading the sacred hall of Souiji the 
Mighty.” The mouth repeats the message but fin-
ishes with “There are intruders...” Once the magic 
mouth ends roll for wandering monsters. Allow the 
derro in Room D22 a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to detect the noise. If the derro hear the 
screams two of them move to the edge of the pit to 
investigate. With the random formian patrols kill-
ing derro, and the instability of the caverns, if the 
investigating derro do not return, the rest continue 
working, fearful of Souiji’s rage.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the depth of the fall to 80 ft. To de-
crease the challenge, replace the destrachan with 
a digester.
D9 . FUSILLADE OF DARTS
Though the roiling mists conceal much, the 
obscene paintings on the walls of this tunnel are 
clear. The scenes depict imagery of blue-skinned 
dwarves sacrificing humanoids to warped idols, 
great dragons with oily black scales breathing 
death on fleeing orcs, and grotesque scenes of 
demons and devils cavorting with mortals. The 
pictures cover the tunnel, floors, walls and ceiling, 
leading to a disturbing sense of being present in the 
pictured hell.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A talented but misguided and mad derro 
artist painted this tunnel to conceal the activation 
trigger of a lethal trap firing a hail of poisoned 
darts. The mechanism is simple – if 5 or more 
pounds of weight touches the pressure plate, a 
fusillade of darts fires up from the floor. Given the 
density of the paintings and the persistent fog, this 
trap has claimed its fair share of formian hunters 
and treasure seekers. Even the derro have a diffi-
cult time remembering exactly where the pressure 
plate lays.
 '
Fusillade of Deathblade Darts. Detect: DC 25 Wisdom 
(Perception); Disable: DC 25 Dexterity; +10 to hit; 
7 (2d6) poison damage (DC 20 Constitution saving 
throw for half damage).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs can find the trap by succeeding a DC 32 
(the fog adds a +5 to the DC) Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check. Triggering the trap causes a number of 
darts to fire at the PC stepping on the plate. Once 
per day, a single derro from room D20 comes to 
remove any corpses killed by the trap.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the poison damage reduce the target’s maxi-
mum hit points until the end of the next long rest. 
To reduce the challenge, reduce the save DC by -5.

D10 . INTERSECTION
Roiling clouds of mist fill this intersection, 
impeding your vision. Odd noises, clacking sounds 
and an occasional groan sound from ahead. 
Through the gloom, you see three tunnels leading 
away. All of the tunnels are dark and murky, filled 
with more of the same clammy fog. In the center 
of the three tunnels is a headless granite statue 
of a robed man with arms upraised and pointing 
in your direction. Then, you notice several torches 
bobbing down one of the tunnels. Shortly after 
their appearance, they disappear around a comer.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Several things happen as soon as the 
PCs enter this room. First, their appearance trig-
gers the dancing light created by guards and wards. 
These bobbing lights appear as torches. Souiji 
programmed the dancing lights to appear as soon 
as a living creature enters the intersection at the 
edge of Room D11 and waits there for three rounds 
before moving back into the room and disappear-
ing. The derro savant hopes to lure intruders to the 
suggestion and stinking cloud in Room D11 in an 
effort to distract and destroy them before they get 
too deep into his territory.
Second, the statue in the hall always faces the 
largest number of PCs, pivoting on its base. The 
derro here constructed it to frustrate and confuse 
intruders, hoping to stall them long enough to 
mount a counterstrike. However, with the derro 
rebels’ numbers depleted, the function of the statue 
serves little more than as a distraction.
Third, this intersection features a confusion 
effect, making it 50% probable that the PCs believe 
they are going in the opposite direction from the 
one chosen. There is no saving throw for this.
A PC succeeding at a DC 22 Wisdom (Survival) 
check notices the tracks of small creatures moving 
from the hall leading to Room D22 to the hall lead-
ing to Room D13.
Encounter Condition: Drafty
Tactics: When the statue moves on its base, it grinds 
loudly, echoing down the tunnel. The derro in 
Room D22 are accustomed to the random noises, 
but if the PCs are indecisive and test the statue by 
moving around, three derro from Room D22 and 
four more from Room D20 come to investigate.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D11 . HASTILY PATCHED HOLE
The tunnels slightly widen before terminating at 
a cracked and fissured wall. Charred carcasses 
litter the floor here along with small piles of slag 
and ash. The room stinks of burned meat and 
rotten eggs. Bright light shines through the cracks 
of the far wall. You think you hear whistling of 
wind, as well.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A week ago, a team of derro rebels, 
searching for a way out, accidentally broke through 
this wall to the lava beyond. The room filled with 
the molten rock and magma mephitis, killing all 
the miners instantly. Souiji realized this room could 
serve as an excellent trap. He commanded duergar 
slaves to erect a shoddy retaining wall, just strong 
enough to keep the lava out, but easily destroyed 
with a well-placed hit. Then, he commanded the 

287
duergar to chisel away the floor near the wall to 
allow more lava to fill in, should the wall fall.
With the room complete, Souiji uses a guards 
and wards (suggestion) to suggest to the first person 
entering the room that what lays beyond the wall is 
in fact the way out, urging them to escape. Beyond 
the wall the gust of wind blows the stinking cloud at 
the wall, so when the wall collapses, the wind blows 
the stinking cloud inside along with the lava.
The first person entering the room must suc-
ceed a DC 15 Wisdom save or take a suggestion to 
break down the wall and escape the dungeon. The 
wall has 15 hp and a damage threshold of 15.
Encounter Condition: Tremors 18
Tactics: If the PC reduces the wall’s hit points to 0, it 
shatters and collapses, releasing the stinking cloud 
into the first 20 ft. of this room and forcing all in-
side the area of effect to succeed a DC 15 Constitu-
tion save or become nauseated and poisoned for as 
long as they remain inside the affected area and for 
1d4+1 rounds afterward. In addition to the effects of 
the spell, lava splashes all PCs in the cloud’s effect, 
dealing 21 (6d6) points of fire damage, DC 15 Dex-
terity save for half.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add 1d6 magma mephits and 1d4 steam mephits to 
the lava. To decrease the challenge, reduce the lava 
splash to 4d6 points of damage.
D12 . SCYTHE GAUNTLET
This tunnel features the same clinging mists 
encountered since you first entered these mines. 
Littering the length of the tunnel are dismembered 
limbs and heads of strange insect creatures, and 
stains of green ichor splashed in random patterns 
throughout. The tunnel continues ahead beyond the 
limits of your vision.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This tunnel heads south before turning 
back to the east. Where it turns, three trip wires 
stretch across the width of the tunnel, concealed 
by the mists. Pressure of any kind triggers the trap, 
causing razor sharp scythes to snap out of hidden 
recesses and slash anyone in their way. On the fol-
lowing round, poison gas mixes with the fog, filling 
the air with deadly maddening poison.
A derro name R’Tobn designed this devious 
trap to impress his master with his ingenuity. 
Souiji rewarded the enterprising derro by letting 
him test the trap himself. A PC succeeding a DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check finds the rotting 
severed remains of the derro inventor near the 
tripwires. Souiji permits no one smarter than he is 
to serve him. 
Finding the trip wires is difficult in the poor 
lighting and thick fog. Worse, all three wires are at 
different heights, and it only takes triggering one 
of them to set off the trap. PCs can find the central 
wire by succeeding a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) 
check. If they succeed by 5 or more, they find the 
other two wires. 
Tripping any one of the three wires will activate 
the trap. Two wall scythes lash out from hidden 
recesses for each 10-ft. section of the hall’s length. 
Each blade carries a virulent form of filth fever, 
having no incubation time and dealing damage 
immediately on a failed saving throw. On the 
following round, the hall fills with poison gas. The 
gas disperses three rounds after the trap triggers. 
Roll randomly per 10-ft. section to determine the 
scythes’ targets.
 '
Filth Fever Wall Scythe Traps (2 per 10-ft. section). 
Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 
18 Dexterity; +6 to hit; 9 (2d4+8) slashing damage. 
Each creature hit must succeed on a DC 11 Consti-
tution saving throw or the damage reduces its max-
imum hit points until the end of itsnext long rest.
 '
Poison Gas Trap. Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Percep-
tion); Disable: DC 20 Dexterity; +6 to hit; all crea-
tures in the hall must make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or suffer 7 (2d6) poison damage. A 
successful saving throw results in half damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Though the scythe blades create a lot of 
noise, scraping out of the hidden recesses, the 
derro in this section are accustomed to the trap’s 
activation and are confident in its ability to dispatch 
intruders.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
double the damage of the trap. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the number of scythe traps to 
one per 10-ft. section and remove the possibility of 
reducing maximum hit points.

288
D13 . BURROW
The long tunnel opens into a wide chamber clouded 
by swirling mist preventing you from gauging 
its actual size. Through the haze, you see debris 
consisting of sharp rocks and bones littering the 
floor. There is a definite stench of rotten meat 
mixed with another sharp and acrid smell. To the 
right, warm light shines through the fog, and to the 
left are sounds of metal ringing on stone.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room serves as a large intersection 
connecting several smaller tunnels leading to the 
various lairs for the rogue derro controlling this 
section. In the southern end of this room are three 
5-ft. diameter tunnels housing three ankhegs.  The 
derro befriended these beasts and now employ 
them as guards. The light the PCs notice emanates 
from Room D14 where the lava has collapsed some 
of the floor. Otherwise, the fog effect of guards and 
wards permeates this chamber, concealing other 
exits from this room. 
This room also carries the same confusion effect 
as found in Room D10. The confusion effect makes 
it 50% probable that the PCs believe they are going 
in the opposite direction from the one they chose. 
The floor in this room is worse than other areas 
in this section. The poor footing reduces speed to 
half, making the Dash Action impossible.
Encounter Condition: Fog 10
Tactics: Unless a derro accompanies the PCs – these 
creatures learned to distinguish the vibrations 
made by their makers from other tremors – the 
ankhegs detect intruders as soon as they enter the 
room. The ankhegs squirm out from their tunnels 
and attack the nearest PC. While in the narrow 
tunnels, they take a -4 penalty to attack rolls and AC 
and move at half speed. Once out of the tunnels, 
the ankhegs move at normal speed, having adapted 
to the treacherous floor. These creatures fight to 
the death. 
Sounds of combat attract the attention of the 
derro in Room D20. They come to investigate in 1d3 
rounds. Allow Souiji (Room D19), a DC 11 Wisdom 
(Perception) check to hear the sounds of the con-
flict. If he succeeds, he casts a few protective spells 
in preparation of an invader breech. 
If the PCs explore this room after Day 2, remove 
the ankhegs and replace them with 4 formian war-
riors sentries.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of the encoun-
ter, add three ankhegs. To decrease the challenge, 
increase the number of rounds it takes for derro to 
investigate to 1d6 rounds.
D14 . PLAYED-OUT MINE
The narrow tunnel opens into a bright cave, heated 
to uncomfortable levels by a mass of lava fed by 
a hole in the wall. Here you see a sea of magma, 
with small creatures swimming through the molten 
rock, tossing globules of magma at wispy imps 
flying near the lava’s surface. Steam clouds much 
of the room, concealing the details, though it is 
clear the footing is unusual, with ripples and waves 
common to flowstone. Beyond the pool of smoking 
magma is another tunnel leading off into more 
gloom, lit by the feeble light of a fallen torch. A 
slight tremor shakes the chamber causing streams 
of dust to fall from above and a rock to splash into 
the magma. As soon as the tremor stops, you hear 
someone call out to you from the darkened cave 
across the pool of lava.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Duergar miners, like the ones in Room 
D11, accidentally broke through the outer wall of 
this complex, flooding the room with magma. The 
retreating slaves fled down another tunnel where 
they died in Room D16. Unable to fill the breach, 
the derro in the rest of the section leave this room 
alone, fearing the lava’s spread throughout the rest 
of the tunnels.
Each day, Souiji places a magic mouth inside the 
small tunnel on the opposite side of the pool of 
magma. Three rounds after a non-derro enters the 
room, the spell calls for help (in Common) saying, 
“Help...I’m trapped...Oh please help me,” before 
falling quiet. Lying on the floor in the tunnel’s bend 
is a small globe of light created by the guards and 
wards dancing lights effect to appear as a dropped 
torch. The effect of this is to lure invaders across 
the lava to expose them to the concealed stinking 
cloud triggered by their crossing.

289
Crossing the pool of lava should be relatively 
simple for PCs of this level, as they probably have 
the means to fly across it. However, crossing the 
lava triggers the stinking cloud laying just beneath 
the surface of the lava, causing the lava to bubble 
up and splash all crossing PCs dealing 2d6 point of 
fire damage and exposing those PCs to the effects 
of the stinking cloud. PCs in the area of effect must 
succeed DC 19 Constitution saves or become nau-
seated for as long as they remain over top of the 
lava and 1d4+1 rounds after they leave.
Encounter Condition: [Deep Darkness]
Tactics: The derro ignore any sounds coming from 
this room, as they are used to intruders falling vic-
tim to this trap.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D15 . FLOW
Beyond the rift in the wall, it is clear the apparent 
sea of lava is in fact a wide river of molten rock 
flowing sluggishly into an enormous cave farther 
downstream. Partly submerged in the flow is an 
odd device, similar to a wagon, but with a large 
glass canister, several burned hoses and a cone at 
the end. The lava conceals the rest of the machine. 
Corpses crowd the top of the device. Some of 
the bodies are obviously missing legs or arms, 
and charred by the flow. Despite the condition of 
the bodies, and the burned hoses, the machine 
seems intact. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The “wagon” in the lava is a magical 
device called a sounder (see Room D53 for details). 
The derro use it to determine depth and direction 
while digging. The gnomes constructed the ma-
chine, but with the unusual qualities of the mines, 
it works sporadically, occasionally unleashing a 
stroke of raw electricity, killing one or two slaves per 
discharge. This sounder and the unfortunate slaves 
fell into the lava at Room D11, and floated down 
stream before an adamantine spar beneath the 
surface of the magma snared it. The corpses have 
all succumbed to poisonous vapors, starvation and 
splashing lava.
If the PCs cross the lava, they attract the atten-
tion of 1d6 magma mephits and 1d6 steam me-
phits, who attack at once.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The mephits attack any PC crossing the 
stream. The magma mephits use fire on the first 
round to create clouds of smoke, while the steam 
mephits employ steam to mask their positions 
before closing in for the attack. Thereafter, both 
types of mephits use breath weapon attacks to hit 
as many opponents as possible.
Should the combat continue more than four 
rounds, 1d3 magma and steam mephits come 
along to join the combat. More show up every 
four rounds. If the PCs flee, the mephits do not 
pursue them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have mephit reinforcements arrive each round. To 
decrease the challenge, increase the number of 
rounds it takes for the mephit reinforcements to 
arrive to eight rounds.
D16 . THE DEAD
Beyond the pool of smoking lava is an irregular 
tunnel extending 40 ft. into swirling mists before 
switching back towards the west. At the end of the 
western tunnel lie five or six bodies in a heap. The 
bodies are all grey-skinned dwarves and most have 
fatal burns. A few, though, have empty cavities in 
their abdomens, as if something ate its way out 
from the inside.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: After the derro breached the wall in Room 
D14, those not killed outright by the lava fled here. 
Most of the derro succumbed to their burns, but a 
few tried to dig their way free. Before they were able 
to make much progress, the xill eggs hatched inside 
them and the pupae ate their way free. Nothing 
lives here now.
PCs find nothing of value on the bodies. Most 
dropped their tools in their haste to get away from 
the danger. A PC succeeding a DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check discovers bloody scratches on the 
wall. Written in Undercommon, the markings read, 
“From within...”
Encounter Condition: Fear 18

Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A few tools are scattered about the Room, 
but nothing of value is found here.

D17 . BARRIER
The door to this room is closed.
This short mineshaft extends 8 feet before ending at 
a wall of natural stone.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Souiji wards the door leading to the derro 
encampment and storage facilities by concealing 
the door with the lost door feature of guards and 
wards. An arcane lock also protects the door. Even 
if the PCs manage to remove both magical wards, 
they still need to bypass the mechanical lock and 
the trap to get through. Finally, touching the door 
triggers the alarm, alerting Souiji to the presence of 
intruders.
 '
Arcane Locked Iron Door. Open: DC 25 Dexterity; hit 
points 60 to break (triggers trap below)
 '
Door Trap. Detect: DC 25 Wisdom (Perception); 
Disable: DC 20 Dexterity; 5-ft. radius poisonous 
fumes if triggered; DC 18 Constitution saving throw 
or take 3d6 damage and maximum hit points are 
reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken 
until the end of the next long rest.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If Souiji did not hear the sounds of combat 
in Room D13, touching the door alerts him to the 
presence of intruders. He orders the derro scouts 
sharing his quarters to take positions in the hall-
way using darkness for cover and to conceal the 
entrance to Room D19. Souiji casts his power-up 
suite of spells in preparation. These derro do not 
leave the safety of their tunnels nor do they retreat 
to Room D18. 
The stone giants, if they invade, do not detect 
this door until Day 6. If the PCs explore this area 
after this day, the door is shattered.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the poison with a cloudkill trap. To decrease 
the challenge, change the poison trap to a confusion 
trap (save DC 15).
D18 . STORAGE CAVE
This thirty-foot egg-shaped room is free of the 
pervasive fog polluting many of the nearby 
corridors and rooms. Crates, barrels, boxes and 
sacks lie in a haphazard jumble. Many of the 
contents spill out onto the floor, revealing grains, 
wine bottles, a few weapons and tools. Aside from 
the flight of a frightened spider, nothing moves.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The renegade derro stored their sup-
plies here until yellow mold became problematic. 
Chtrax’s servants, unable to dislodge the renegade 
derro, contaminated a small store of supplies with 
yellow mold spores and placed them in a lightly 
guarded room for the derro to raid. The renegade 
derro, thoroughly insane, overlooked how easy it 
was to gain access to the goods, and in triumph 
brought them back to Souiji. Placing the purloined 
swag in their warm storage chamber, they promptly 
forgot about it. After a few weeks, the yellow mold 
spores quickly took over the room, killing a few 
careless derro. Souiji, seeing the gift as another 
blessing from his goddess, carefully constructed a 
trap, while removing the salvageable supplies. Now 
the yellow mold has expanded to cover the entire 
room, concealed by a permanent minor illusion (he 
cast it from a stolen scroll), depicting the actual 
equipment but concealing the threat of the mold.
PCs wishing to disbelieve the illusion must 
succeed a DC 19 Wisdom save to see the mold fills 
each 5-ft. space along the perimeter of the Room. 
PCs touching any of the items disturb the con-
cealed yellow mold, causing a 5-ft. area to burst 
into a 10-ft. cloud of spores. All PCs in the area of 
effect must succeed a DC 15 Constitution save to 
resist the effects of the mold or take 1d6 points of 
Constitution damage. One minute later, regardless 
of whether the PC saved or not, the victim must 
succeed a second DC 15 Constitution save or take 
2d6 points of Constitution damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Derro do not come to this room except to 
toss more junk inside from a safe distance. There-
fore, any noise in this area makes the derro in 
Room D19 suspicious, causing them to take up de-
fensive positions as described in Room D17, if they 
had not already done so.

Treasure: The mold ruined all of the perishable goods 
in the room. All of the tools, weapons, and armor 
are ruined. A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, 
triggering the mold, uncovers a ceramic bottle. In 
it is an unlabeled potion of fire resistance. The label, 
written in Dwarven, identifies the type of potion.

D19 . RENEGADE DERRO WARREN
This unusually shaped natural cavern has a sour 
stench of charcoal. The ceiling rises over 60 ft. 
high, and a cloud of smoke hangs there unmoving. 
Holes in the floor give off streams of foul smoke, 
strangely sweet. To the right is a large cleft in the 
rock, where a few clay pots, crates and barrels 
clutter the area in a jumble. There is no fog here, 
and there are no visible exits.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This cave is Souiji’s lair and campsite 
for his loyal renegade derro. When Chtrax seized 
control over the derro mines for his own purpos-
es, some of the derro refused to serve him. These 
derro, led by the savant Souiji, fled to the empty 
mines in the western section of this region. From 
here, they mount sporadic guerrilla raids to disrupt 
Chtrax’s operations. They have had minimal impact 
on the efforts, instead drawing formian guards 
into their complex to fall victim to the nasty traps 
protecting them.
PCs may believe that because Souiji and his 
followers fight against Chtrax, they may have an ally 
here. Nothing is further from the truth. Souiji is a 
lunatic. He sees the PCs as a threat to his control 
and eventual power grab.
 Souiji is always here. He uses his map of ward-
ing to defend his section of the tunnels once per 
day. He knows he only has a few charges left, and 
when the map runs dry, so do his defenses. The 
savant keeps eight derro guards with him at all 
times. Souiji, paranoid as ever, also cast alarm on 
Room D19, so any tampering with the door mental-
ly alerts him.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If Souiji is aware of the PCs, as is likely if they 
enter through Room D17, he orders the elite derro 
guards to take up positions in the hall and conceal 
themselves with darkness. Souiji then casts the 
following spells in this order: shield, spider climb, 
and resistance. He crawls up the wall to a hidden 
nook above the entrance to this cave, where he 
has cover. 
The derro in the hall hide in the concealing 
darkness. When the PCs enter the area, the derro 
ambush the opponents. The elite derro guards are 
more frightened by Souiji than they are of the PCs 
and will fight to the death. 
The giants, after Day 2, do not immediately de-
tect this concealed section of tunnels, only discov-
ering it on Day 6. Once discovered, 3 stone giants, 
a formian taskmaster, 2 dominated destrachan and 
3 formian warriors break through the door at Room 
D18 and attack Souiji and his minions. If the PCs 
are not present for this confrontation, assume the 
giants win.
Treasure: Piled in the cleft are boxes, barrels and 
crates all containing dry goods and water. A thor-
ough search of the area, DC 20 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check, reveals a small cache of gemstones, 
stolen from the mines. All of the gems are rough 
cut, but if polished and finished, their value dou-
bles. The stones include the following: irregular 
MAP OF WARDING
This scroll of vellum is simple and 
unadorned, creased from folding. Each 
warding map has 50 charges, just like a 
wand, and when all 50 charges are used, 
the map disintegrates. The user can 
draw on the map with any implement 
once per day, taking 30 minutes and ex-
pending a charge from the item. For the 
map of warding to work, the map must 
replicate the layout of the section. At 
the end of the activation time, the map 
creates an effect identical to guards and 
wards (spell save DC 15). The illustrator 
makes all determinations of the spell as 
if he had cast the spell himself.

freshwater pearl (14 gp), bloodstone (89 gp), amber 
(109 gp) and a black opal (1,056 gp).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give +2 to Souiji’s spell save DC and spell attack 
rolls, and give him an additional 4 sorcery points. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the number of elite 
derro guards from eight to four.
D20 . DERRO ENCAMPMENT
If the miners did not hear the sounds of combat with 
the ankhegs in Room D13, read the following:
Two feeble campfires burning on either side of this 
cave light the wide, mist-filled room. To the left 
huddle six blue-skinned dwarves, clearly derro. To 
your right is a small crowd of dwarves, some with 
grey features, while others are pale and bald. Only 
the derro speak to one another, while the dwarves 
are silent with heads bowed. In the center of the 
room is a loose pile of large anthropomorphic 
insect heads, their blank eyes watching the cave’s 
entrance. The room stinks with fear.
If the PCs encountered the derro in this room in 
Room D13 instead, read the following:
This wide room is quiet. Standing in the shifting 
mist are six bedraggled and hungry duergar and 
one slender and bald deep dwarf. All the dwarves 
wear bloody rags, and most have filthy bandages 
covering a wound or stump. They watch you with 
cold eyes and grim expressions.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room houses the rebel derro min-
ing encampment, consisting of four derro, three 
duergar, and six deep dwarves. Souiji keeps all 
derro rebels he does not fully trust with the slaves, 
forcing them to share living quarters. The savant’s 
suspicions are ungrounded and the product of his 
insanity; none of these dwarves or derro has the will 
or the ability to hatch a plot against their rene-
gade master.
The derro collect the heads of formian warriors 
and workers, dumping them in the middle of this 
room to serve as a demarcation line the slaves 

293
cannot cross. This is an arbitrary border. Neither 
side is better, and all live in abject squalor.
If the PCs attracted the attention of the derro by 
their combat with the ankheg in Room D13, then 
this room houses just the dwarven slaves. All but 
one of the slaves carries a xill egg in their stomachs, 
and they know it dooms them, having seen many of 
their numbers succumb to the hatching. Souiji has 
promised to cure those slaves who work hard and 
prove their worth. Derro guards take those slaves 
meeting his criteria to Room D18, where the guards 
dump the poor slaves into the yellow mold, Souiji’s 
cure. Even though the slaves have not seen any of 
their number returned, the other derro claim the 
savant granted the slaves freedom and healing for 
their loyalty. Consequently, the slaves are fanatically 
loyal to the savant and see him as the means for 
their salvation.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Shifts change at 12-hour intervals, and the 
derro and slaves move to Rooms D22, D23 and D24, 
where they relieve the other derro and their slaves. 
The shift change takes one minute for the relief 
to reach the other miners and one minute for the 
relieved to return to Room D20. During this time, 
the derro encampment is empty.
If the derro hear the PCs advance, they order the 
slaves to take up their picks and attack the intrud-
ers. Meanwhile, all the derro hide in their darkness 
effects on the first round, awaiting the opportunity 
to strike dealing sneak attack damage.
If the PCs did not draw the derro from this room 
into the fight at Room D13, the derro have disad-
vantage on their Perception checks, while the slaves 
are too tired and demoralized to bother listening. 
Meanwhile, all the derro hide in their darkness 
effects the first round, awaiting the opportunity to 
strike, dealing sneak attack damage.
If the PCs defeated the derro from this room 
in the ankheg battle, the slaves take up their picks 
and ready themselves for the attack. PCs entering 
the room have one round to make a DC 20 Charis-
ma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) check 
to improve the slaves’ attitude. If the PCs fail, the 
dwarf slaves attack, fighting to the death.
Finally, if the PCs do not explore this room until 
Day 3 or later, they find the bodies of all of the 
opponents normally encountered here, slaughtered 
by the giants.
Treasure: Aside from a pile of formian heads, there 
are 4 extra heavy pikes, 2 warhammers and a hand 
axe in a wheelbarrow, hidden beneath a tarp made 
of cured yrthak hide (50 gp value).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add two more derro and give each duergar 
and deep dwarf a use of the Action Surge ability. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of 
derro by two.
D21 . SUPPLY ROOM
The narrow tunnel extends 40 ft before sharply 
turning to the right, where it ends in a small cave, 
no larger than 10 ft wide, filled with junk. Bars 
of corroded silver, bolts of stained cloth, axe, 
hammers, picks and other mining equipment fills 
the outer edge of the room, leaving a narrow island 
in the sea of trash. There are no visible exits, and 
the room is otherwise unoccupied.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The derro and slave miners, from Room 
D20 and Rooms D22 through D24, use this cave for 
storage. Most of the equipment here is worthless, 
except the silver bars and a few hidden items. The 
derro do not guard this room and only come here 
to drop off broken pieces of equipment or unusable 
items acquired from a raid.
Encounter Condition: [Deep Darkness]
Tactics: PCs exploring this room do not draw atten-
tion to themselves unless they make an inordinate 
amount of racket, causing a derro from Room D20 
to investigate. This is a good place for the PCs to 
rest, heal and recover spells, with only a 10% chance 
each day of a Random Encounter. 
Treasure: The piles of equipment contain all manner 
of useless items, including, but not restricted to 
the following: hempen rope 500 ft., seven barrels 
of tepid water, an empty bucket, six hammers, ten 
miner’s picks, four spades and a scrap of parchment 
providing a rough sketch of Room D32 through 
Room D51, though there are no notes, scale or any 
useful information aside from just the layout. In 
addition, there are 10 1-lb. trade bars of truesilver, 
worth 50 gp each, wrapped in treated Formian 
chitin to protect them. If mortals handle the bars, 
their touch transmutes the metal into mundane 
silver. Finally, buried beneath the equipment are

Dwarven Allies
The PCs could befriend and gain the help of liberated slaves throughout the region. Having 20 
or more dwarven soldiers at their sides could mean a significant difference in the survival rate 
throughout the adventure. However, before the PCs build an army of ex-slaves to overthrow the 
evil masters, there are a few issues to consider first.
Xill Eggs: There is a 25% chance any given duergar or deep dwarf carries a xill egg. As the process 
of gaining the egg is maddening, along with the realization of death’s immediacy, many dwarves 
go insane. Consequently, add +20 to the alignment roll if the dwarf has been infected. See Xill 
Eggs and the Derro above for more details.
Alignment: Unless the PCs are of matching alignment, they may have some difficulties convincing 
the slaves to join their cause, by dint of alignment alone. Deep dwarves are “often” lawful neutral 
or just neutral, making them more amenable to the PCs actions than the “usually” lawful evil 
duergar (although a Lawful Evil dwarf might be happy to follow a strong leader who promises 
revenge). To determine the alignment of a particular liberated slave, roll on the following tables.

83-90Chaotic Good94-96Chaotic Evil 
91 -98Chaotic Neutral97-99Chaotic Neutral
99+Chaotic Evil100+Chaotic Good
Loyalty: Chtrax uses propaganda and fear to coerce the slaves to work hard and face the innumer-
able dangers of these mines. As a result, most of the slaves are blind to the deception of their 
xill and formian masters. To enlist a dwarf as an ally, a PC must make a Charisma (Deception) 
or Charisma (Persuasion) check. Make these checks in secret. Dwarves whose attitudes change 
to helpful are willing to join the PCs. Dwarves whose attitudes are friendly may offer advice. 
Other results indicate the dwarves do not help. If more slaves are helpful than the rest, all of the 
dwarves present help the PCs, though those whose attitudes are unfriendly or worse betray the 
PCs and their traitorous brethren at their nearest convenience. If the PCs are willing to arm the 
slaves, give the PC making the Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check advantage 
on the roll.
Possessions: Most dwarves carry light picks and hammers, wear no armor, and have rags for 
clothes. It is up to the PCs to outfit these allies adequately if they wish their assistance.
Combat: Recordkeeping for combats involving 20 or more combatants can be nightmarish for a 
GM. You could simply roll for groups of slaves, pooling their health and reducing their damage 
as you might for a swarm. You could gloss over damage, and have the allies aid cinematically, de-
scribing many more enemies than a room possesses, and the allies hold them off while the PCs 
combat the creatures actually mentioned in the Encounter description. Finally, you could simply 
disallow allies from joining the PCs in combat, providing only advice, rest, etc.

D22 . MINERS
When the PCs enter the tunnel leading to Room D22, 
read the following:
The darkened tunnel features the same clinging 
mists so pervasive in these tunnels and continues 
deep into the darkness. Ahead, clangs of tools on 
stone sound and echo down the tunnel. Amidst the 
calls of the hammers and picks, you hear voices, 
and then a weird humming noise jarring your 
bones. Just as soon as the noise starts, the roar of 
crumbling rock masks it.
When the PCs approach the entrance, read the 
following:
This gloomy cavern is clearly a mining work site. 
Derro overseers monitor the efforts of several 
slaves who chip away the dense rock in the many 
shallow mines. The source of the unusual noise is 
clear, now, as a derro with a spear prods a chained 
destrachan toward another small tunnel. The room 
is dark but lacks the clinging mists of the tunnel.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This cave is the heart of the renegade 
derro miners. Souiji, though unaware of Chtrax’s 
true goals, knows the xill searches for something 
in the mines. In a vain effort to defeat his neme-
sis, Souiji directs the derro under his command to 
mine the tunnels in the hopes they can beat Chtrax 
to his goal. Given their position in the complex, the 
derro have thus far broken through the outer walls, 
releasing lava into the tunnels (see Rooms D11 and 
D14). This has collapsed several tunnels, killing 
many slaves and derro, and the derro are now likely 
to break through to some of the rooms under the 
xill’s control. Two days after the PCs first enter this 
complex, the rebel derro break through to Room 
D27 as described in the opening sidebar.
Before this time, however, five derro overseers  
command five duergar and four deep dwarves 
to work the tunnels in the Room. In addition to 
the slave forces, the derro also control a moody 
destrachan, using it to break up particularly dense 
sections of rock. There are two miners per alcove, 
including Room D23. A bulette and its derro han-
dler work the tunnel at Room D24.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 8
Tactics: The derro command the slaves, whose loyalty 
is thanks to Souiji’s promises (see Room D20 for 
details as to why), to attack the PCs. The handler 
in Room D24 releases his pet bulette as soon as 
combat breaks out in Room D22. The derro use poi-
soned crossbow bolts from positions of darkness. 
The destrachan uses the PCs attack to get revenge 
on its captors. Each round it is 50% likely to attack 
the derro and their slaves or the PCs. If the PCs 
attack the destrachan, it focuses its attack on them 
exclusively. If combat goes against the miners, 
dwarf slaves fall back to the two tunnels at room 
D23 in an effort to lure them to an unstable corri-
dor. All of the miners fight to the death.
On Day 2, the slaves break through the wall 
to Room D27, creating a permanent connection 
between the two rooms. The stone giant chief 
invades the Old Mines with 3 regular stone giants, 
a formian taskmaster and 3 formian warriors to 
destroy the problematic derro. See Room O27 for 
more details.
If explored on Day 3 or later, the room holds 
nothing but corpses.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one destrachan and replace the deep 
dwarf slaves with duergar fighters. To decrease the 
challenge, replace the duergar miners with deep 
dwarf miners.
D23 . UNSTABLE TUNNEL
This tunnel ends after 15 ft Spider web cracks cover 
both walls and ceiling here.
Initial Attitude: N/A or Hostile
Encounter: Two slaves, a duergar and deep dwarf  
normally work this tunnel. The dwarves have 
warned their masters of the danger in the tun-
nels, but the derro make them work it anyway. Any 
loud noise, such as that created by fireball or ice 
storm, causes the tunnel to collapse. Should the 
ceiling collapse, the cave-in deals 24 (8d6) points of 

296
bludgeoning damage, or half on a successful DC 15 
Dexterity save.
A PC succeeding a DC 20 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) can identify weakened ceilings for 
what they are.
Encounter Condition: Poor Footing 4, Hazardous 
Footing 18, Tremors 18
Tactics: If combat goes against the miners in Room 
D22, a slave retreats to this tunnel in a mad act of 
sacrifice. Should the PCs follow, a derro uses its 
psychic thunderwave to collapse the tunnel, bring-
ing it down on himself and the PCs. The dwarves 
realize they are doomed, and feel their loyalty lies 
with Souiji.

D24 . CHAINED BULETTE AND ITS 
MASTER
If combat does not occur in Room D22, read the 
following:
A cloud of dust and the sounds of scraping pours 
out of this tunnel. Through the flying debris, a 
large, armored beast claws at the rock, while an 
exceptionally mad derro looks on, a wide smile 
staining his face. Neither the beast nor the derro 
notice you.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A bulette and its derro handler work this 
short tunnel. The derro handler has a tenuous con-
trol over the monster, forced to devote his entire 
attention on goading the bulette to dig through 
the derro’s use of the animal friendship spell. The 
noise the monster makes as it digs is deafening, 
so the derro is unlikely to hear any disturbances or 
disruptions.
The bulette is loud in its work, deafening all 
creatures within 10 ft. for as long as they remain in 
the area. Note, deafened PCs suffer a -4 penalty to 
initiative checks, automatically fail Wisdom (Percep-
tion) checks, and have a 20% chance of spell failure 
when casting spells with verbal components.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises 8, Echoes 4
Tactics: If combat occurs in Room D22, allow the 
derro handler a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check 
to notice each round. Should he succeed this check, 
he turns from the bulette to investigate. Allow the 
bulette a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to no-
tice when something breaks the handler’s attention. 
If the monster succeeds, it attacks its handler and 
leaps into the thickest group of combatants, killing 
PCs, derro and slaves alike.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give the handler an additional attack and disallow 
the bulette from attacking its allies. To decrease 
the challenge, have the bulette immediately notice 
the handler’s distraction. Instead of having it enter 
the melee, it burrows away after killing its for-
mer master.

D25 - D31 . THE APPROACH
Rooms D25 through D31 serve as the only path to the 
Chtrax enclave. A mixture of lairs, checkpoints and 
even a foundry, this path is exceedingly dangerous. 
It is fraught with hostile derro, formians and giants, 
and the PCs’ successes or failures here determine 
the reactions of the rest of this Region. Yet, despite 
this section’s importance to Chtrax’s overall plan, 
his bulwarks are failing as evidenced by the corpses 
of derro in Room D25 and the malfunctioning trap 
at Room D26.
There are far fewer traps in these sections, as Chtrax’s 
resources are flagging, forcing him to rely on the 
stone giant chief to defend the back door to his op-
erations. Still, the xill master barely trusts the giant, 
so he commands a myrmarch to dispatch regular 
formian patrols through these areas. These threats, 
along with the occasional creeping xill, combine to 
make the approach a dangerous path.
If the PCs have not vanquished the renegade derro 
in the Old Mines by Day 2, the miners in D22 break 
through the wall to Room D27. There, the stone giant 
chief leads an expedition to kill the rogue derro, 
bringing 3 more stone giants, a formian taskmaster 
and 3 formian warriors to the fight, leaving this room 
empty of hostiles until Day 4, when the stone giant 
returns. If the PCs have still not defeated the stone 
giant chieftain by Day 6, he returns to the Old Mines 
to kill Souiji.
When the PCs first enter this section, they must suc-
ceed a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the 
loud slamming noise caused by the malfunctioning 
trap in Room D26. From Room D27, they must suc-
ceed a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the 
hammering noises from the factory at Room D30.
All rooms here are cloistered unless specified other-
wise. Throughout this area are hewn stone walls with 
average ceiling heights of 30 ft. in rooms and 15 ft. in 
tunnels. Debris in the tunnels gathers at the edges in 
collections of small rocks, trash, scraps of cloth and 
luminescent fungi. The scent of smoke lingers in the 
air and wisps of it are visible near the ceilings.

TRAP
The source of the awful din comes 
from this 30-ft.-long corridor. From 
the ceiling, a huge 5-ft.-by-5-ft.-by 10 
ft. stone block drops and slams into the 
floor making a terrible racket, sending 
clouds of rock dust in the air. Soon after it 
falls, it will rise back up into the darkness, 
while another block falls, randomly. Bloody 
stains, broken bits of bone and teeth, and 
several flattened corpses litter the floor here.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This trap is broken. When working prop-
erly, mere passage down the tunnel would trigger 
the trap, causing blocks to fall onto unsuspecting 
intruders. A secret lever on either side of the trap, 
when pulled, would disable it. Now, however, 
the levers on both sides are broken and the trap 
triggers at random. For four hours each day, the 
trap stops functioning, allowing passage into the 
Great Hall.
Each round, roll 1d12 to determine which 5 ft. 
section malfunctions and triggers the trap auto-
matically. In addition, whenever a PC stands in 
any of the 5 ft. sections of the hall, there is a 50% 
chance for the trap to trigger.

D27 . STONE GIANT QUARTERS
This large cavern is nearly 40 ft. across, with 
a dripping ceiling 50 ft. above. Boulders litter 
the floor, along with the skins of an unspecified 
enormous reptile. Through the gloom, you think you 
see blankets, a few overlarge crates and a fire pit 
radiating light.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This large cave houses the stone giants in 
service to the xill. Most times Talig and 1d6 stone 
giants recline here, relaxing and entertaining them-
selves while biding their time before rising against 
their newest masters. While they wait, they fre-
quently kill lone derro in revenge for their years of 
captivity and hide the bodies under a pile of loose 
rocks. These giants are not immediately hostile, 
though they attack if they sense an easy opponent 
for the sheer enjoyment of the act.
The stone giants have maintained a presence in 
these mines. Before Chtrax, the derro had en-
slaved them as a labor force. When Chtrax assumed 
control, however, he approached them as equals in-
stead of in the more traditional hierarchy of a mas-
ter-slave relationship. The xill approached the elder 
stone giant, Talig, and lied, requesting the giant’s 
assistance in recovering a lost artifact. The giant 
agreed on the promise of power in return and see-
ing the puny outsider as no immediate threat. The 
stone giant elder offered his stone giant minions to 
serve as laborers and guards to survey the progress 
of the artifact’s recovery. Talig ordered his minions 
to seize the object as soon as the derro and their 
workers uncover it. By positioning stone giants 
throughout the complex, Talig expects an easy vic-
tory over the xill. Until Chtrax recovers the artifact, 
the giants are content to work, watch and wait.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises 7, Echoes 10
Tactics: The giants are wary of trespassers, like soli-
tary derro, moving to and from Room D28 through 
Room D26, so when the PCs enter this room, the 
giants know. While not overtly hostile, because they 
feel the PCs do not represent a threat to them, they 
are suspicious. They watch from hidden positions 
among the rocks. If the party is small, they attack 
by hurling boulders until the PCs close. Otherwise, 
they allow well-armed PCs to pass unmolested. If 
the PCs explore this room, however, Talig steps into 
view and questions why they intrude. Respectful 
PCs succeeding at a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) 
check improve the giants’ attitudes to being friend-
ly. If they manage this, the giants give them the 
following information if asked. If the PCs succeed a 
DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check, the giants give 
the following information freely. Otherwise, they 
simply tell the PCs to move on or die.
A canny, red-skinned devil named Chtrax controls 
the mines now with the help of formians, orderly 
insect men. He commands the surviving derro, their 
slaves and even our brethren to dig into the depths 
to reach some lost artifact. We are not certain as 
to what this artifact is or what it does, but Chtrax 
is adamant about retrieving it. While we serve him 
now, it is out of convenience. Ahead is the Great 
Hall. There the slaves process silver for tools and 
other equipment. Beyond the hall are the deeper 
mines. It is dangerous there, certainly no place for a 
group such as yourselves.
The giants have no interest in helping the PCs, 
and if requested, they refuse. If the PCs are respect-
ful, the giants let them pass freely. Should combat 
occur, Talig takes cover behind the myriad of huge 
rock piles, hurling rocks at the PC spellcasters. The 
other giants in the room close after one round of 
ranged attacks. These giants fight to the death.
If the PCs kill the giants and leave their carcasses 
in the open, the Great Hall has a 20% chance each 
day of going on alert (see below).
Depending on developments in other parts of 
this region, this room may be empty. The renegade 
derro, if undefeated, punch through the wall on 
Day 2. The giants here react by gathering a force 
and wiping out the rebels, leaving this room empty. 
The chieftain returns with 1d3 stone giants on Day 
3, watchful of the new exit. On Day 6, the chief-
tain, if still alive, goes back into the Old Mines to 
kill Souiji.
Treasure: The giants hide their accumulated wealth 
with the bodies of the slain derro in a rock pile. 
Clearing the rock requires 2 hours of hard labor 
and exposes diggers to Slimy Doom, carried by the 
rotting derro. PCs digging must succeed a DC 14 
Constitution save or contract the disease.
PCs succeeding in excavating the treasure find 
1,567 gp divided somewhat equally between three 
leather sacks. In a fourth bag are 6 gems, consisting 
of a tourmaline (800 gp), 2 red spinell (700 gp, 600 

300
gp), zircon (70 gp), onyx (50 gp) and a small shard 
of obsidian (8 gp).
Each stone giant, including the chieftain carries 
a large sack holding 2d12 throwing rocks and 1d4+6 
mundane items.
 '
Slimy Doom. Contact with the substance requires a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw to resist. Incuba-
tion period of 1 day, 1d4 Constitution damage.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the stone giants’ attitudes start as Hostile. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the number of addi-
tional stone giants to 2.
D28 . SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY
Weird lights and ghastly shadows play on the walls 
of this 30 ft. long tunnel. Pounding noise of metal 
clanging on metal echo up ahead, making the 
tunnel inordinately loud. Otherwise, the tunnel is 
as dark as it is ordinary.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This tunnel leads to the sentry post at 
Room D29. There are no creatures here and the 
tunnel is debris-free. PCs clearly hear the sound of 
metalworking and smelting coming from ahead 
in Room D30.
There are too many tracks here to get an accu-
rate read on the types and numbers of creatures 
travelling through this tunnel.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs retreat from the formian and 
gorgon guards in Room D29, and if they did not 
befriend or encounter the giants in Room D27, the 
formians and the stone giants trap the PCs here, 
flanking them.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D29 . GUARDS
The tunnel takes a sharp turn to the left, opening 
into a small room serving as an antechamber for a 
larger cavern. Mounted on two armor-plated bulls 
with green mist curling from their nostrils and 
dead empty eyes, are two insect men, each holding 
a guisarme.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Functioning as guards overseeing traf-
fic coming from Room D27 and beyond to enter 
Rooms D30 and the Great Hall are two formian 
warriors mounted on gorgons. These creatures are 
vigilant about their duties, allowing only 
stone giants, derro, and dwarves to pass into 
D30 without question. They are watchful for 
intruders, cautious about creatures they do 
not recognize and readily attack any who 
threaten the complex.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs have 1 round to make their case 
to these guards to avert combat, by succeed-
ing a DC 25 Charisma (Deception), Charis-
ma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) 
check. PCs suffer a -5 penalty, as the guards 
are exceptionally suspicious. If combat 
sounded from Room D27, the guards attack 
without question.
One gorgon uses its breath weapon, 
while the other tramples into combat. The 
formian warriors attack PC using their 
polearms. On the second round of com-
bat, one of the mounted formians urges its 
mount to charge surviving PCs, while the 
other uses its breath weapon attack. There-
after, the formians and gorgons use charge 
attacks and attacks with reach weapons 
until the gorgons’ respective breath weap-
ons recharge.
Combat with any formian alerts all form-
ians in the region due to their hive mind 
ability, though only those nearest the threat 
respond. Consequently, fighting the form-
ians here alerts those in the factory and the 
Great Hall.

301
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the formian warriors’ hit points by 10 each. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the guards to two 
formian warriors and one gorgon.
D30 . FACTORY
This gallery houses a major operation. Scores 
of derro work at various tables and forges, 
constructing weapons, tools, carts and rails. More 
insect men stand at locations throughout the room, 
overseeing the operation. In the center of the room 
is a stone golem, obviously built from petrified 
humanoids. A crucible, where liquid iron and 
other metals bubble, spitting sparks and belching 
toxic fumes, lights the room with an inconsistent 
warmth. Ahead, another tunnel leads to a large 
cavern with several buildings and attendant 
toiling slaves.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The factory is where the derro work 
raw materials into useable items. Here they forge 
tools, weapons, ore cars, tracks, spikes, and braces 
for tunnel ceilings out of the corrupted truesil-
ver and iron. Twenty infected derro work in this 

302
room. Chtrax does not trust the slaves to handle 
the viral manufacturing needed to keep his excava-
tion moving. As a result, only derro work here and 
only under constant guard of six formian warriors 
and a stone golem, to ensure against sabotage or 
intrusion.
 The formians are wary of intruders. They 
question any non-derro entering the room. Unless 
a formian, stone giant or Chtrax accompany and 
vouch for the PC, the formians attack.
Encounter Condition: Hostile
Tactics: If PCs battle the sentries in Room D29, the 
golem and half of the formians move to Room D29 
to aid the guards, while the remaining formians go 
to Room D31 and ready an action to tip the crucible 
of molten ore to spill into the room once all the PCs 
enter. The derro climb on top of their worktables, 
using darkness for concealment and level cross-
bows at the room’s entrance, firing as soon as they 
see the PCs.
When the PCs enter the room, the formians 
and the derro at room D31 tip the crucible, spilling 
liquid metal over the whole floor. PCs on foot take 
8d6 points of fire damage each round they remain 
in the liquid metal, no save. The derro avoid the 
damage because the worktables hang on chains 
suspended from the ceiling. The metal cools after 
20 minutes. The formians in room D32 hold their 
positions, waiting for the intruders to enter the 
Great Hall.
Treasure: This room is home to over one hundred 
hammers, picks, shovels and an assortment of 
mining tools, though none are valuable enough to 
warrant plundering. There are also 24 short swords, 
15 warhammers and 18 light maces. Finally, there 
are over 300 spikes, three huge ore carts, and 200 
ft. of linear track.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the number of wailing golems by 
one. To decrease the challenge, remove the form-
ian warriors.
D31 . FOUNDRIES
A crucible hanging from an iron frame and filled 
with bubbling molten metal dominates this alcove. 
Beneath it burns a white-hot fire, fed by jets of gas 
from numerous holes set into the walls. All around 
this area are barrels containing water. Some 
derro climb a ladder leading up to the bowl and 
drop broken weapons, tools, chants of ore, and on 
occasion, a squeaking rat into the molten mixture, 
while others dip smaller crucibles attached to long 
poles to withdraw a portion and pour it into the 
casts at the base.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This is where five derro smelt the raw 
metals into a liquid state and add enough adaman-
tine to make it as strong as steel.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The formian warriors in Room D30 move to 
this area to tip the crucible and cover the floor with 
flaming metal. Tipping the crucible is simple, re-
quiring a pull of a lever. The formians take positions 
on the ladders, using ranged attacks against the 
PCs. Near the water barrels is a stack of repeating 
light crossbows. At the first sign of trouble, each 
derro grabs one and moves to a position of cover, if 
any, before firing. 
Pouring hot metal onto the floor causes the 
water barrels to burst, resulting in billows of steam. 
All creatures in this room gain concealment (20% 
miss chance) from the obscured vision. There is no 
way to tamper with the gas jets fueling the fire. PCs 
unlucky enough to find themselves in the inferno 
take 20d6 points of fire damage and automatically 
catch fire. To put themselves out, they must make a 
DC 15 Dexterity save.
Treasure: Though none of the derro have any person-
al treasure, they do possess ten 1-lb. bars of ada-
mantine, each worth 50 gp.

303
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage dealt by the liquid metal to 
20d6. To decrease the challenge, do not allow the 
crucible to be tipped.
D32- D51 . GREAT HALL
This section is the central nervous system of the 
complex, comprised of Rooms D32-D51. This is an 
enormous cavern, over 200 ft. wide and with a ceiling 
towering 100 ft. overhead. Nine buildings dominate 
the center of the cavern. Several of these structures 
feature connecting ramps and tracks leading to other 
buildings and ultimately the track at Room D51. 
Three balconies overlook the workings, while the two 
major entrances feature more guards. Filling this 
vast gallery are stone giants, derro, xill and more, too 
numerous to count. In short, a direct confrontation is 
tantamount to suicide.
The massive bore dominates the Hall. Four stone 
giants push the handles to pull the truesilver out of 
the earth. The extracted truesilver climbs the helical 
thread with each turn, until it reaches the platform 
at the top. There, derro workers use force clamps to 
retrieve the ore and place it into large metal carts. A 
fifth stone giant pushes the cart to a conveyer car-
rying the metal to the separation room, where the 
slaves separate the ore from the rock before send-
ing the truesilver on to the refinery. In this room, 
slaves heat the truesilver and form it into bars where 
they are loaded onto palettes. Stone giants carry the 
palettes to the wheeled carts, depositing them into 
the gnome’s lab in Room D53. The slaves move the 
separated rock to Room D37, where an yrthak uses its 
sonic lance to pulverize it into gravel, so the dwarves 
can easily dump it in lava flow.
Chtrax uses the Great Hall as his command center, 
where he oversees operations in the mines, from dis-
cussing security issues with his myrmarch captain to 
inspecting the extraction process, to checking on the 
various excavation sites. In all, Chtrax keeps a close 
eye on his servants’ progress, and he does so from 
this quasi-cockpit.
If the PCs fight any formians before entering this 
place, the entire cavern is put on alert because of the 
hive mind link between formians. Each room below 
details normal encounters and encounters when 
alert. In addition, each room also details what rein-
forcements, if any, arrive to aid their beleaguered 
allies. Even though many rooms list the number of 
formian warriors as they arrive in waves, there are 
only so many formian warriors. The Great Hall has 
30 unattached formian warriors, 10 unattached elite 
formian warriors and 2 unattached formian taskmas-
ters. Each time the PCs engage in a combat in one of 
the Great Hall’s rooms, they undoubtedly draw more 
formians to their position as indicated in the room’s 
description. The formian warrior reinforcements 
number 30. After all 30 formian warriors or formian 
taskmasters arrive or fall, no more arrive. You could 
move formian warriors from other encounter sites to 
engage the PCs, but those formians are under orders 
to protect their respective rooms. Regardless, the 
Great Hall resumes its normal activity after one hour 
lapses (unless the PCs kill or rout everyone).
Chtrax remains in the Great Hall from Day 0 until 
Day 3. Later, he moves to Room D58 after the tar-
rasque reaches the first adamantine bands. Thereafter 
he has a 10% chance to be in a random room in the 
Great Hall, a 50% chance of being in Room D78 and 
a 40% chance to be inspecting the mines in Rooms 
D78 to Room D80.
Destroying the myrmarch in Room D39 or the phy-
lactery in Room D49 changes the dynamics of the 
section. If the PCs kill the myrmarch, formians in the 
Great Hall, the Approach, and the Old Mines suffer a 
-2 penalty to attacks, saves and skill checks and lose 
their hive mind ability Destroying the phylactery, 
however, removes the hive mind ability from all the 
formians in the region, telling them their queen is 
dead. The formians stay in their respective locations 
attacking any non-formians encountered, including 
the giants, derro, slaves, xill and PCs. While in this 
enraged state, PCs cannot reason with them. All 
formians fight to the death.
Allow cautious PCs to move unmolested through this 
area if they do nothing to draw attention to them-
selves. There are plenty of places for the PCs to move, 
such as skirting the edge of the cavern, keeping out 
of range of the inhabitants’ darkvision and if they 
avoid combat, they should be fine. Should the PCs 
make a direct assault, let them feel the full weight of 
Chtrax’s power.
Buildings have masonry walls 1 ft. thick. Climb-
ing these walls requires a DC 15 Strength (Athlet-
ics) check.

304
The Great Hall has a sunken floor, but it is relatively level and free of debris. Unlike most of this section, pur-
plish flames erupt from the floor, lighting the Great Hall. The flames are not hot but offer light equivalent in 
brightness to moonlight. Water extinguishes them for five minutes before drying enough to flare up again.

D32 . SENTRY
Guarding this wide staircase are two insect men 
and a large stone creature, its face chiseled into a 
cruel smile. Behind the guards is a vast cavern filled 
with several buildings and creatures, all working 
near a massive bore, drilling into the heart of the 
earth. Balconies overlook the cavern occupied 
by watchful guards manning ballistae. This is a 
fearsome place, filled with more opponents than 
even the bravest army could hope to overcome.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly or Hostile (if alerted)
Encounter: Guarding this entry are two formian 
warriors and a stone golem. The formian warriors 
vigilantly protect the Great Hall from intruders and 
are even suspicious of derro, with the recent raids 
from the renegades.
Getting past these sentries requires a successful 
DC 20 Charisma (Deception) check (DC 25 if alert-
ed). Combat with these formians puts the Great 
Hall on alert.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs fought the derro and formians in 
room D31, these guards are ready for them, posi-
tioning themselves on either side of the door and 
leaving the stone golem in the middle to block the 
passage into the hall. When the players engage the 
golem, the formian warriors take full attacks on the 
closest PCs.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the number of formian warriors by 
four. To decrease the challenge, remove the form-
ian warriors.
D33 . SEPARATION ROOM
This large building stands between a smaller 
connected building and a ramp descending from 
the platform housing the bore. With no windows 
and only a single door, the plumes of smoke 
rising from stacks on its roof make the structure 
more imposing.
If the PCs enter, read the following text:
Inside, a tracked ramp dumps nuggets of rock 
mixed with glowing metal into bins. Dwarven 
slaves move the full bins to worktables where other 
slaves use odd devices to handle the materials 
and separate the silvery metal from the bare rock. 
Once they separate the metal, they place the pure 
substance on a conveyor to carry it out of the 
room and into the attached building. Clouds of 
dust boil up from the tables, venting through the 
ceiling. Overseeing the entire operation is a large 
ant creature and a derro with a glazed expression 
at its side.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent or Hostile (if alert)
Encounter: A formian taskmaster oversees the sepa-
ration of the truesilver from the rock. At his side is a 
dominated derro overseer. Working the room are 12 
duergar  and 20 deep dwarf slaves.
Encounter Condition: [Stagnant Air], Unhallowed
Tactics: If not alerted to intruders, the taskmaster 
scuttles over to the PCs inquiring of their business. 
To convince the formian they belong, they must 
succeed a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) or Charis-
ma (Intimidation) check. The taskmaster does not 
respond to Persuasion. If the Great Hall is alert, the 
formian alerts his fellow formians through the hive 
mind of the presence of intruders. 
Combat with the formian taskmaster alerts the 
rest of the Great Hall. If alerted, in 1d6 rounds a 
patrol of 1d4 formian warriors arrives to aid the 
combatants against the heroes. More formians 
join the fight every 1d6 rounds thereafter until the 
threat is suitably contained. The reinforcements 
continue until 12 formian warriors have answered 
the call. Then, the formian myrmarch from Room 
D39 arrives to destroy any surviving PCs.
If the PCs or a tremor destroys this building, 
production stops for 1d6 days, as formian workers 
hasten to rebuild the structure. In the meantime, 
the formian myrmarchs confine the slaves to their 
quarters or the formians send the dwarves to work 
in other tunnels.
Treasure: There is a considerable fortune of truesil-
ver in this room, but direct contact by a mortal 
turns it to normal silver. There are 75 pounds of the 
stuff scattered between the bins and the various 
tables, worth over 75,000 gp if the PCs can handle 
it without contaminating it. Otherwise, the silver is 
worth 375 gp.

306
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
decrease the amount of time for reinforcements 
to just 1d3 rounds. To decrease the challenge, 
increase the amount of time for reinforcements to 
2d6 rounds.
D34 . REFINERY
Inside this smaller, attached and windowless 
building, slaves work to melt silver metal taken 
from a conveyor from the adjoining building. 
They then cast the metal into bars. When suitably 
cooled, the slaves load the bars onto low carts, for 
the stone giant to move to yet another structure. 
More insect men watch the slaves’ progress with 
blank and unblinking stares. The room is replete 
with poisonous fumes.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent or Hostile (if alert)
Encounter: Once the slaves separate the ore from the 
rock in Room D33, they send it here on a conveyer 
belt, where ten deep dwarf slaves smelt the ore 
into liquid and cast it into bars, making it easy to 
transport for the gnome in Room D54. Six formian 
warriors are vigilant in the security here, keeping 
alert and watching for treachery. Two stone giant 
laborers load the palettes of bars onto carts and roll 
them to Room D42. This process is extremely slow 
and dangerous.
The fumes from the refining process are toxic. 
As the dwarves are extremely resistant to poison, 
and the formians immune, most are unaffect-
ed. PCs entering this room must succeed DC 15 
Constitution saves or take 1d6 points of Consti-
tution damage from the poisonous atmosphere. 
Ten rounds later, they must succeed a second save, 
regardless of the success or failure of the first, 
against the same DC, or take an additional 1d6 
points of Constitution. This continues for every 10 
rounds they remain in the room and for ten rounds 
after they leave.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the room is alerted, the formian warriors 
notify the other formians in the Great Hall to the 
presence of intruders. Otherwise, the formian 
warriors question the PCs about their presence. PCs 
must succeed a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check 
to convince the formian warriors they belong. On a 
failed check, the warriors ask the PCs to leave. On 
a failed check by 5 or more, the formians warn the 
other formians in the Great Hall of intruders and 
then attack.
The formians command the slaves to attack the 
PCs, though the slaves only fight until half their 
number fall before fleeing. The stone giants hurl 
carts at the PCs, dealing damage as boulders. They 
have enough for two carts apiece. Finally, the form-
ian warriors move to gain flanks against the PCs.
Combat tips off the rest of the Great Hall. If 
alerted, a patrol of 1d4 formian warriors arrives 
in 1d6 rounds to aid the combatants against the 
heroes. The reinforcements continue until a total 
of 12 formian warriors answer the call, and then 
the formian myrmarch from Room D39 arrives to 
destroy any surviving PCs.
If the PCs or a tremor destroys this building, 
refinement moves to the factory at Room D30. If 
the PCs destroyed the factory there, production 
stops altogether for 2d6 days until the formian 
workers can rebuild the structure. In the meantime, 
the formian myrmarchs confine the slaves to their 
quarters or send dwarves to work in other tunnels.
Treasure: There are 50 pounds of truesilver in 
bars and in raw form in this Room. The haul is 
worth over 37,500 gp if the PCs can handle them 
without contamination. Otherwise, the silver is 
worth 250 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
decrease the amount of time for reinforcements to 
just 1d3 rounds. To decrease the challenge, reduce 
the number of stone giants by 1 and increase the 
amount of time for reinforcements to 2d6 rounds.
D35 . TRACKED RAMP
Large cans filled with rock travel down the tracked 
ramp descending from the large platform to end 
inside of an adjacent building.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: An ore cart travels down the ramp once 
per five minutes from Room D39. The ramp itself 
is unguarded. Walking on this ramp reduces a 
PCs speed by half and requires a successful DC 20 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to keep one’s footing. 
A failed check indicates the PC falls on the ramp. A 
failed check by 5 or more indicates the PC fell to the 
floor below, taking 8d6 points of falling damage. 

307
The ore carts are unavoidable, tak-
ing up the whole of the ramp. PCs 
struck by a cart take 2d6 points 
of damage and tumble down the 
ramp into a bin in Room D33.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The ramp has 40 hit points 
and a damage threshold of 10. If 
the PCs or tremors destroy the 
ramp, slaves unload the rock from 
the threads of the bore at Room 
D40 and load it into carts and the 
giants push the carts to Room 
D33. It takes the formian 
workers 1d3 days to 
rebuild this ramp.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D36 . 
TRACK
Two stone 
giants push 
a cart along 
this track. With 
each movement, 
the contents splash and 
run down its sides. Th track 
originates at an angled building and 
ends at the drill site.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: Two stone giants haul grease to the drill 
site. The giants ignore PCs unless they attack or if a 
formian taskmaster commands the giants to attack 
the PCs. If the Great Hall is alert, the giants contin-
ue their business.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs improving the giants’ attitude to Friendly 
or better, which requires a successful DC 15 Cha-
risma (Persuasion) check, convince the giants to 
divulge what they know about the Great Hall. The 
giants know the basic operations in the hall but 
are unfamiliar with anything beyond that. They do 
know formians take injured derro to the Infirmary 
at Room D48. Most derro return, but all notice they 
return changed.
If drawn into a fight, the giants 
are ruthless, having lived under the 
oppressive rule of first the derro and 
then the xill. They use the oppor-
tunity to vent their frustration, by 
hurling a cart at the PCs, dealing 
damage as a thrown rock, before 
they close with slam attacks.
Combat here instantly alerts 
formians warriors, who in turn 
alert the rest of the hall. Every 1d4 
rounds, 1d6 formian warriors arrive, 
continuing until 18 formian war-
riors have arrived. In addi-
tion, the derro sentries at 
Room D45 fire ballista 
bolts at the PCs for 
as long as they 
can see them. 
After six rounds 
of fighting, 
the formian 
myrmarch from 
Room D39 ar-
rives to dispatch 
the remaining 
intruders.
If the PCs or trem-
ors destroy this track, 
slaves carry tubs of grease 
until the formian workers repair 
the track in 1d3 days.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
decrease the amount of time for reinforcements 
to arrive to just 1d2 rounds. To decrease the chal-
lenge, reduce the number of stone giants by 1 and 
increase the amount of time for reinforcements to 
1d8 rounds.
D37 . GRAVEL AND RENDERING SHOP
This angled building is nondescript, featuring two 
entrances. The first is a wide bay, large enough to 
allow the giant exiting to pass without ducking. 
The second is a smaller wooden door. The air here 
stinks of rock dust, mixed with the stench of a 
charnel house.

308
Once inside, read the following:
Inside, the twin purposes of this building become 
abundantly clear. First, a chained, large, winged 
reptile and two blind bipedal creatures with cone-
like mouths shatter rock with a magical sonic 
ability. Derro overseers watch the progress, while 
dwarf slaves drag more large boulders into the 
path of the blasting. Clouds of grey dust swirl into 
the air. It is fair to say the noise is deafening.
The second function of the room is less mundane. 
Corpses of slaves, derro and even giants sit in a pile 
while a weird dinosaur creature hoses them with 
a stream of liquid. Where the fluid falls, the flesh 
breaks down and streams of acrid smoke rise. Four 
masked slaves push the runoff into troughs to carry 
the fluids into a sunken vat. There three more slaves 
stir the mixture with long poles. Occasionally, one 
dips a bucket into the stinking pool to pull forth a 
fresh batch of lubricant.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This building serves to break down rock 
and flesh. The chained creature is an yrthak and the 
others are destrachan. Two derro handlers  watch 
their progress, and 4 deep dwarves shovel the grav-
el into carts to be dragged away at a later time to 
Room D7. The derro and the dwarves are deaf from 
the noise.
On the other side is a digester and his handler. 
The slaves are all deep dwarves. These slaves make 
lubricants for drilling from liquefied carcasses.
If the PCs enter this room, the derro are suspi-
cious but ignore them. As this room lacks a formian 
presence, even if the Great Hall is under direct 
assault, the derro handlers have no way of knowing 
about it without going outside, something they 
only do at shift changes. Consequently, all of the 
creatures here ignore the PCs.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The derro are not interested in conversing 
with PCs. Any questions about the complex, its 
operation or leadership tell the derro the PCs are 
outsiders. Should a fight break out the derro fall 
back and command the others to attack.
Round 1: Derro handlers fall back and fire crossbow 
bolts at the PCs. The digester uses its acid spray 
in a cone effect. The destrachan move to catch the 
PCs in crossfire of destructive harmonics while 
the yrthak uses its sonic lance on the chain hold-
ing it. The slaves flee.
Round 2: Derro handlers fire another barrage of 
poisoned crossbow bolts or use psychic thunder-
wave on groups of PCs. The digester charges the 
nearest living creature, ally or enemy, and at-
tacks using its claws until its acid recharges. The 
destrachan use their destructive harmonics again 
if losing, or if they have the upper hand, switch to 
the nerves effect. The yrthak wings out through 
the wide door and takes to the air, launching 
sonic lance attacks at the various buildings and 
individuals in the Great Hall. The slaves flee 
to room D42.
Round 3: If the combat goes against the derro 
and their minions, they create darkness and flee, 
leaving the combat to their remaining minions. 
Otherwise, the derro alternate between thunder-
wave and poisoned bolts. Surviving destrachan 
continue with their destructive harmonics. The 
digester continues its attack.
Following Rounds: If the yrthak escaped, it wreaks 
havoc in the Great Hall, using its sonic attacks to 
destroy structures and villains alike. In response 
to those attacks, the ballistae at Room D43 and 
Room D45 launch attacks at the winged reptile. 
Formian workers scramble to repair damaged 
structures and 2d12 formian warriors and a 
formian myrmarch move to Room D37 to elim-
inate the PCs on round 6. The rest of the Great 
Hall is alert until the formians destroy the yrthak 
and the PCs.
If the PCs or tremors destroy the gravel and render-
ing house, the formians force the slaves to carry the 
larger rocks directly to the lava. For lubrication, they 
simply slaughter slaves at the drill site and dump the 
bodies near the bore. This is not effective, but the 
derro do not care. It takes the formian workers 2d3 
days to rebuild this structure.
Treasure: One of the derro handlers has an iron key. 
The key unlocks the gate to Room D47.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a formian taskmaster to this Room and have 
it control the digester. To decrease the challenge, 
remove the yrthak.

309
D38 . CISTERN
A 40 ft. tank, nearly 30 ft. in diameter, stands in 
the center of the chamber. Guarding it are five 
insect men and a crippled derro, who fills cups with 
water drawn from the massive container. The floor 
around the cistern is muddy.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This reservoir holds fresh water. Six form-
ian warriors stand guard, while a crippled derro ra-
tions out the water to dusty workers. The formians 
pay little attention to the humanoid, being watchful 
of trespassers or idle workers. Four formians stand 
evenly spaced, guarding each cardinal point. The 
other two flank the derro.
Mylthran, the crippled derro, on the other 
hand, despises his lot, the formians and the xill 
controlling the entire region. In fact, his hatred is 
so fierce he despises even his own people, seeing 
them only as traitors. Several weeks ago, he broke 
his leg in a cave-in. He refused treatment in the 
infirmary and managed to set the bone himself. 
Somehow, he was not condemned to the rendering 
house, and instead forced to work the cistern.
Since taking his new post, he has secretly poi-
soned the well, adding more and more toxins with 
the intention of murdering the region’s population. 
What has happened instead is most of the inhabi-
tants have resisted the poison and grown immune 
to it. Those that have not are easier to paralyze and 
thereby easier to inject with eggs. Now the well is 
extremely toxic and anyone who has not been accli-
mated to it must succeed a DC 15 Constitution save 
or take 5d6 poison damage and have their maxi-
mum hit points reduced by the same amount until 
the end of their next long rest. Ten rounds later, 
regardless of whether they made the initial save or 
not, the victim must succeed another save against 
the same DC, or the poison deals an addition 5d6 
poison damage, reducing the maximum hit points 
in the same way.
Encounter Condition: Poor Footing 4
Tactics: The formian warriors do not wait for discus-
sion before attacking. A myrmarch ordered them to 
protect the cistern at all costs, as it is the only fresh 
water supply in the region. Hence, if the PCs ap-
proach and the formian warriors notice them, they 
attack first, alert the rest of the hall to the threat if it 
is not already aware, and call for reinforcements.
Mylthran runs as fast as he can to Room D32, 
where he believes he can make a quick escape.
If the PCs or tremors destroy the cistern, the en-
tire operation is in jeopardy with no water, and the 
inhabitants dehydrate. There is a supply of water 
in Rooms D72 and D75 but Chtrax does not divert 
labor to acquire it. Instead, he doubles and triples 
the shifts, intent on finding the vault before his 
labor force perishes. Should this take place, escalate 
the tarrasque’s timeline as detailed in the Introduc-
tion by two days, meaning the devils escape on Day 
5 instead of Day 7.
PCs without water can survive for 1 day plus the 
number of hours equal to their Constitution scores. 
On the third day after the cistern’s destruction, all 
slaves take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. On the 
fourth day, they take another 3 (1d6) points of non-
lethal damage. This continues until the tarrasque 
breaks through to the devil vault.
Treasure: Mylthran carries 6 doses of dark reaver 
powder (300 gp each).
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a normal stone golem. To decrease the chal-
lenge, reduce the number of formian warriors by 2.
D39 . BORE
A giant drill descends into the earth. Sprouting 
from it are four large iron bars, pushed by four 
stone giants. The drill threads carry chunks of 
rock upward to the platform overhead. The rock 
surrounding the drill head is slippery with lubricant 
and smokes with a foul odor. Overseeing the bore’s 
progress is an enormous insect creature and four 
small insect warriors.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Four stone giants push the handles of 
an enormous bore. As they rotate it, chunks of 
truesilver emerge near the cavity. Shifts change in 
8 hours, effectively doubling the stone giants here 
for 1 minute.
Watching their progress is the formian myr-
march in charge of truesilver extraction and refine-
ment. He keeps eight formian warriors nearby to 

310
ensure security. Aside from overseeing the drilling 
process, he is aware of disruptions in the Great Hall 
and commands his formian warriors through the 
hive mind to deal with disruptions. In addition, he 
is also responsible for repairing structures and so 
oversees the formian workers in Room D46.
The formian warriors are watchful for slackers 
and intruders and actively make Wisdom (Percep-
tion) checks. Each round the PCs remain within line 
of sight with the bore, allow the formian warriors 
there to make Wisdom (Perception) checks. If they 
see the PCs, they immediately report the informa-
tion to the myrmarch, who in turn alerts the rest of 
the hall to the presence of intruders.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The myrmarch has his orders – destroy all 
intruders. Leading his warriors, he sends out a 
mental alert to all the formians in the complex and 
attacks the PCs. Each round 1d3 additional formian 
warriors arrive to help their master, until 18 form-
ians arrive. The giants continue to turn the bore 
but will defend themselves if attacked. The derro 
ballistae crews at Rooms D43 and D45 target PCs 
they can see.
Killing the myrmarch removes the formians’ hive 
mind ability and imposes disadvantage to all of 
their attacks, saves and skill checks.
If the PCs, tremors, or the destruction of the 
platform above collapses and destroys the bore, 
truesilver extraction stops, lacking the materials 
to construct another one. Fortunately, Chtrax has 
enough truesilver for the gnome to make the collar 
for the Pit Fiend. With the extraction processes halt-
ed, Chtrax leaves this section to oversee the digging 
at Room D61 or with the gnome in Room D63, 
with a 50% chance of each. The formians divert 
the slaves and derro to various tunnels throughout 
the complex to aid in the digging efforts. There-
after, only a token force remains in this chamber; 
halve the number of all creatures encountered in 
this section.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add 30 hit points to the myrmarch. To decrease the 
challenge, increase the time it takes reinforcements 
to arrive to 1d6 rounds and remove one of the 
stone giants.
D40 . PLATFORM
Framing the great drill are four huge metal poles, 
easily 5 ft. thick. Atop of the poles, 80 ft. high, 
stands a platform. From one side descends a ramp. 
Two ladders, on the opposite sides offer access 
to the top.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: Working atop the platform are six form-
ian workers who use force clamps to move the rock 
from the helical thread to the iron carts. Two stone 
giants push the carts onto the tracked ramp, Room 
D35, to travel down to Room D33. These creatures 
are oblivious to combat and do nothing to aid those 
below, focused obsessively on their work.
Encounter Condition: Tremors 18
Tactics: These creatures do not initiate combat, nor 
do they converse with PCs. If attacked, however, the 
stone giants fight back. The formian workers flee, 
scuttling down the ladders as quickly as they can. 
The stone giants hurl chunks of rock as they come 
up the thread until the PCs close to melee combat. 
Then, the giants make bull rush attacks to knock 
them from the platform. The ballistae at Room D43 
and Room D45 have a clear line of sight to the plat-
form and direct their attacks there if combat breaks 
out, unconcerned if they happen to hit a stone giant 
or formian. If the PCs reduce the giants to 10 hit 
points or less, they surrender.
A fall from the platform deals 24 (8d6) points 
of damage.
If the platform is destroyed, the bore falls to 
the floor in a random direction. With the platform, 
the ramp at Room D35 falls as well. To see the 
falling drills’ direction, roll 1d20 and consult the 
table below.

311
D20result 
1-3
Falls on Room D47 and collapses the 
building. All creatures within take 3d6 
points of damage and the monsters go 
on a killing spree, heading in random 
directions, attacking as many creatures 
as possible
4-7
Falls to the floor, creating a tremor as 
if you had rolled 2-4 on the Random 
Encounter Table for this section.
8-10
Falls to the floor, creating a tremor as 
if you had rolled 2-4 on the Random 
Encounter Table for this section. In 
addition, it lands on the track between 
Rooms D34 and D41, halting the 
transport of truesilver.
11-13
Falls on Room D33 and collapses the 
building. All creatures inside take 3d6 
points of damage.
14-16
Falls on Room D37 and collapses the 
building. All creatures inside take 3d6 
points of damage. In addition, the 
surviving monsters go on a killing spree, 
wreaking havoc throughout the section.
17-19
Falls on Room D38, destroying the 
cistern, killing the formian warriors and 
the crippled derro.
20
Falls on Room D46, killing all inhabitants. 
Destruction of this magnitude shuts 
down the entire operation as described 
in Room D39.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
make the platform unstable, requiring the PCs to 
succeed at a DC 15 Dexterity check to keep their 
footing. If they fail by 5 or more, they fall to the 
ground 80 ft below. In addition, add two more 
formian workers, so they can heal one of the stone 
giants. To decrease the challenge, remove one of 
the stone giants.
D41 . TRANSPORTATION AND INVENTORY
A cart track runs into this building from one side 
and out another. A stone giant wheels the cart into 
the building and then walks up the track. Outside 
of the building stand three insect warriors.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Three elite formian warriors guard this 
room. Their orders are to ensure no one tampers 
with arriving or departing ore carts. These crea-
tures are watchful, so allow them to make Wis-
dom (Perception) checks against any creatures in 
line of sight.
Inside a formian taskmaster and its destrachan 
servant inventory the truesilver bars going to the 
gnome. He submits a weekly report to the formian 
myrmarch, who in turn reports to Chtrax to show 
their progress.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The formian warriors generally ignore anyone 
moving past this room, only attacking anyone not 
of the Great Hall and approaching this room. When 
attacking, they do not move more than 10 ft. away 
from the room, falling back should PCs attempt to 
lure them away. Combat with these formians alerts 
the rest of the Great Hall to the intruders. On the 
following round, the formian taskmaster exits the 
room, commanding the destrachan to attack, while 
it enters melee. At the beginning of each round of 
combat, 1d4 formian warriors arrive until 12 show 
up. Then, the formian myrmarch from Room D39 
comes to dispatch any surviving PCs.
If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, busi-
ness continues as normal; a formian taskmaster 
goes to Room D34 to count.
Treasure: At any given time, there are 2d20 1-lb. bars 
of truesilver. Each bar is worth 750 gp. Recall, if any 
creature touches the bar, the bar becomes standard 
silver, worth about 5 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
double the number of elite formian warriors. To 
decrease the challenge, remove the resistances and 
immunities from the destrachan.

D42 . BARRACKS
Ramshackle cots fill this large building. Cobwebs 
cling to corners and the floor is filthy with dust, 
hair and dirt. Otherwise, the room is empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This large building is not much more 
than a warehouse filled with beds, its rear wall ex-
posed rock. Once, the derro slept here, but now it is 
always empty as the derro sleep in or around their 
work areas.
Encounter Condition: [Safe]
Tactics: This is a good place for the PCs to rest as no 
one ever comes here anymore. Only roll for Ran-
dom Encounters once per day at this location.
If the PCs or tremors destroy this 
room, no one notices.
Treasure: PCs searching under 
the cots and succeeding a 
DC 20 Intelligence (Investi-
gation) check find a secret 
compartment concealed 
by years of grime. The 
compartment is locked, its 
key long lost, requiring a 
successful DC 25 Dexterity 
check to open. Alternatively, 
a PC succeeding a DC 20 
Strength check can break it 
open. Inside are the following 
items: six cut sapphires (1,000 
gp each), a small charcoal diagram 
of a repeating ballista (100 gp), an 
obsidian bracelet with three small 
spheres each etched with a decora-
tive rune (140 gp), a perfect cylinder 
made of cherry wood (800 gp), a 
smooth slate ring (500 gp), a doll 
made of human skin (no value), +2 
dagger, ring of water walking, and a 
pearl of power. Souiji’s daughter, a 
consummate thief, left this hidden 
cache. She intended to return for 
her things, but a xill egg killed her 
before she could.
Scaling: N/A
D43 . GUARD BALCONY
A dark staircase carved into the rock 
winds upward, presumably to the balcony 80 ft. 
above the Great Hall. From below, you can see a 
mounted large ballista and derro leaning over the 
rail to watch those below.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Three derro sentries guard the Great 
Hall. One mans the repeating ballista (see below) 
mounted on a swivel base. The other two carry 
heavy repeating crossbows. As they keep an eye out 
for trouble, they use the repeating ballista against 
any foes combating the inhabitants of the Great 
Hall. With their height advantage along with the 
dim lighting in the Hall, the derro have a good view 
of the entire complex.

313
Repeating Ballista: 3d8/19-20; range 120 ft.; crew 1; 
cost 1,000 gp
Unlike normal ballistae, the repeating ballista 
may fire up to six projectiles before needing a new 
cartridge. The crew makes a ranged attack with 
this weapon, but at disadvantage for size. It takes 
3 rounds to reload this weapon, 2 rounds if two 
people work together.
There are five cartridges total for the ballista.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the derro sentries spot combat in the Great 
Hall, they use the repeating ballista and heavy 
crossbow attacks against the PCs. If the PCs come 
up the access tunnel, the three derro ready actions 
to fire their heavy repeating crossbows against any 
intruders coming up the stairs behind them. These 
derro are infected and fight to the death.
If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, the bal-
cony and its survivors fall to the ground, destroy-
ing both the ballista and the sentries. The formian 
workers repair the balcony in 1d2 days.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a second ballista and have each deal an addi-
tion 2d6 fire damage to each hit. To decrease the 
challenge, double the reload time.
D44 . EAST SENTRY
Three steps lead up to this exit. At the top, a single 
sentry defends it. It resembles a giant derro, except 
it is made of granite. Blood stains and shattered 
bones cover the floor below.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The stone golem guards this exit and is 
under orders to attack any creature not accompa-
nied by a formian or derro. Hence, the golem has 
killed many slaves trying to get back to work in the 
mines. The golem attacks the PCs as soon as they 
either attack it or come within 20 ft.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The golem closes with the PCs and uses its 
slow attack. On the following rounds, it uses full 
attack actions as much as possible. This golem 
fights until destroyed. Combat with this sentry 
is common, so 1d6 formian warriors only come 
to investigate 50% of the time. If the warriors do 
come to the fight, they alert the rest of the Great 
Hall, and 1d4 more formian warriors arrive every 
1d6 rounds until a total of 12 formian warriors are 
on site. Thereafter, no one else in the hall comes to 
investigate.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give this stone golem an additional 40 hit points. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the chance of 
reinforcements to 25%.
D45 . GUARD PLATFORM
A dark staircase carved into the rock winds upward, 
presumably to the balcony 80 ft. above the Great 
Hall. From below, you see a ballista extending over 
the railing. At ground level, there is a dark tunnel 
leading to some steps.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The derro sentries that once manned 
this ballista have succumbed to the xill eggs. Now, 
three xill occupy this room, feasting on the remains 
of their former hosts. They are uninterested in the 
developments in the great hall, but if the PCs, or 
any other creature approach within 20 ft. of this 
room, allow the xill Wisdom (Perception) checks 
to notice. If they catch sight of the intruders, one 
creeps forward to the repeating ballista and takes 
aim, while the other two outsiders move silently 
down the stairs.
Repeating Ballista: 3d8/19-20; range 120 ft.; crew 1; 
cost 1,000 gp.
Unlike normal ballistae, the repeating ballista 
may fire up to six projectiles before needing a new 
cartridge. The crew makes a ranged attack with 
this weapon, but at disadvantage for size. It takes 
3 rounds to reload this weapon, 2 if two people 
work together.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Once in position, the xill on the balcony fires, 
hoping to herd the PCs into the darkened tunnel 
where the xill’s comrades wait. PCs scaling the wall 
or flying reach the balcony 80 ft. up, while the xill 
targets PCs still on the ground. Once any PCs reach 
the balcony, the xill retreats to the tunnel entrance, 
where he fights to the death or until his allies come 

314
up from below. Meanwhile, the xill in the tunnel 
“ready an action” to attack the first PC entering 
the tunnel. One focuses on grappling and injects 
an egg into the subject, while the other joins the 
grapple. If more PCs approach, one xill struggles 
to inject an egg in the first victim, while the second 
withdraws from the grapple to defend its ally. These 
creatures fight to the death.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
remove the disadvantage from the ballista and give 
each xill the Sneak Attack feature (2d6). To decrease 
the challenge, remove one xill.
D46 . FORMIAN BARRACKS
This long, low-slung structure is made of stone 
worked in honeycomb patterns. The structure is 
immaculate, the ground around the place smooth 
and level, adorned with line patterns on the floor 
extending outward away from the building some 
10 ft. Round portals offer access to the building’s 
dark interior.
Initial Attitude: N/A or Indifferent
Encounter: This unusual building, designed by its 
occupants, serves as the formian barracks. Though 
outsiders do not need to sleep, formians function 
better with a place to collect their thoughts between 
shifts. The barracks are in effect eight different 
cells. Each cell is bare, except for a conical mound 
in the center where a small orb of granite rests. 
The formians focus their thoughts on the perfect 
sphere as a means to maintain perfectly ordered 
thoughts. Complex line patterns cover the walls and 
floors, leading through the patterns to the mount-
ed spheres.
Presently, the barracks are empty, giving the PCs 
a chance to rest, stage an ambush, or investigate 
their enemy. After 30 minutes roll for a Random 
Encounter.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, the 
Great Hall continues as normal, except there is a 
15% chance any given room has its numbers halved. 
In addition, the loss to the formian workers increas-
es the number of days needed to repair a damaged 
or destroyed building by 1d3.
Treasure: Each room houses a perfect sphere of 
granite. The craftsmanship, not the material, makes 
these 10-lb. spheres valuable. There are eight 
spheres, each worth 20 gp.
Scaling: N/A
D47 . CORRAL OF THE BEAST HANDLERS
The gate to the corral is locked, requiring a DC 25 
Dexterity check to unlock it; the beast handler at 
Room D37 has the key. Inside the gate, the mon-
sters all wander about the open area. A large trough 
of semi-clean water sits at one end. The monsters 
here are beyond caring and have little fight left in 
them. They are fatigued, and only fight if attacked. 
[A fatigued PC can neither run nor charge and takes 
a -2 penalty on Strength and Dexterity checks.] They 
fight to the death, battling mostly in defense and not 
working together.
A 9-ft.-tall wall of stone corrals this place. 
From inside, you hear growling and roaring, the 
crunching of bones and other disturbing sounds 
associated with feasting. Guarding the gate on 
the side facing the great drill are three formian 
warriors holding halberds. Behind them, you 
clearly see a collection of fearsome monsters, 
including a bulette, a couple of digesters and even a 
destrachan.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Three elite formian warriors guard the 
corral to ensure no one tampers with the beasts. 
Inside, there is one bulette, one destrachan, and 
two digesters. The formians are watchful. If the PCs 
approach, and the formians are not on alert, one 
of the formian warriors demands to know the PCs’ 
business. The PCs must succeed a DC 25 Charisma 
(Deception) check to prevent the formians from 
attacking. If the encounter turns to combat, the 
formian warriors alert the rest of the Great Hall 
with their Hive Mind ability before attacking. The 
monsters are all fatigued from their work in the 
Great Hall and are not interested in fighting unless 
provoked. If the PCs keep out of the corral, the 
monsters ignore them.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: After combat starts, 1d2 more formian 
warriors arrive every 1d4 rounds until a total of 
two more have arrived. On the round after the last 

315
formian warrior arrives to reinforce the guards, the 
formian myrmarch from Room D39 arrives.
The formian warriors let the PCs come to them 
rather than charging into the thick of the battle. Re-
inforcements surprise attack the PCs from the rear. 
Even if the desperation of the fight escalates, the 
formian warriors do not draw the monsters inside 
the corral into the fight.
If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, all 
surviving monsters escape and head in random 
directions to kill as many formians and derro 
as possible.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
remove the fatigued condition from the monsters 
inside the corral and have them attack. To decrease 
the challenge, replace the elite formian warriors 
with standard formian warriors.
D48 . HEADQUARTERS
As the PCs approach this room read the fol-
lowing text:
Clearly, this structure is new and imposing when 
compared to the other buildings in this massive 
gallery. Blending alien architecture with the grim 
utilitarian features characteristic of this region, it 
sports fluted columns, odd and apparently useless 
spinning gears, all incorporated in an intricate 
stone pattern. The building is windowless and has 
a single entrance: a purple-steel-crystal-trapezoid-
shaped door.
If the PCs enter, read the following text:
Beyond the glowing door is a foyer of sorts, 
extending 10 ft. to either side and ahead about 
12 ft. The room is barren both of furnishings and 
decor, except for a puce-colored disk inset at the 
center of the room. A single door of the same 
material and shape as the one you just entered 
stands closed in the center of each wall.
Consult the Great Hall introduction for details on 
Chtrax’s placement in this section.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is the entrance to Chtrax’s 
most private sanctum and headquarters. When a 
petitioner wishes to speak with the xill master, they 
know to stand on the circle, call to their master 
and state the purpose of their visit. If Chtrax is 
not present or does not wish to address the peti-
tioner, he ignores them. The derro and formians 
know to leave if they do not hear a response with-
in a minute.
To prevent unwanted intrusions and to com-
mand fear and respect from his minions, Chtrax 
warded all of the doors leading to the inner sanc-
tum with terrible traps. If Chtrax agrees to speak 
with the petitioner, he deactivates the traps from 
inside Room D49 and opens the central door. Oth-
erwise, PCs or foolish servants attempting to reach 
the inner sanctum must contend with the nasty 
devices protecting the xill. 
All three interior doors and the speaking circle 
detect as magical. 
 '
Door Trap of Fireball. Detect: DC 25 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 25 Dexterity; Triggering 
the trap releases a fireball spell upon the char-
acters, who will need to make a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw.
 '
Door Trap of Polymorph. Detect: DC 25 Wisdom 
(Perception); Disable: DC 25 Dexterity; Triggering 
the trap releases a polymorph spell upon the charac-
ters, who will need to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving 
throw to resist or be turned into a peacock.
 '
Door Trap of Cloudkill. Detect: DC 25 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 25 Dexterity; Triggering the 
trap releases a cloudkill spell upon the characters, 
who will need to make a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw to resist.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A; However, if Chtrax is present in Room 
D49, he readies for combat if one of the traps trig-
ger or a PC stands on the speaking circle and says 
nothing. If afforded the time, he grabs the phylac-
tery and hides. See Room D49 for more details.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace all three traps with wail of the banshee traps 
(DC 15 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit 
points; on a success, suffer 10d6 psychic damage). 
To decrease the challenge, change all the door traps 

316
to the following: cloudkill trap (right), chain lightning 
trap (center), and black tentacles trap (left).
D49 . INNER SANCTUM
The stink of this enormous hall is overpowering. 
Overhead hang globes of purplish light casting 
obscure shadows on the walls. Filling the room 
are innumerable tables holding twitching, barely 
conscious derro, duergar and deep dwarves. Given 
their supine positions and distended abdomens, it 
is clear something is gestating inside them. Sprays 
of reddish-brown liquid stain the walls and ceiling, 
while the floor is black and sticky.
If the PCs enter through the center door, or round 
one of the corners, read the following text if Chtrax is 
not present:
In the center of the chamber, upon a dais, stands 
a silver tripod holding a 1-cubic-ft. box of some 
silvery metal, encrusted with gems, etched 
with runes, and flickering with unfathomable 
intelligence.
If Chtrax is present, read the following text instead.
In the center of the chamber and upon a dais 
stands an empty silver tripod.
Initial Attitude: N/A or Hostile
Encounter: This room is a testimony to the depths of 
Chtrax’s fathomless evil. To replace the substandard 
derro, Chtrax breeds his own here. Summoning an 
occasional derro or dwarf to receive a reward for 
their labors and wisdom, Chtrax injects an egg in-
side the host. Some he releases back into the mines 
– others, especially the dangerous ones, he keeps 
locked up here.
Amid the developing wombs, Chtrax plots his 
course, tracking the progress of his tunneling, the 
truesilver extraction and the birth rate of his spawn. 
He also keeps the formian queen’s phylactery here, 
in proximity so he can maintain the hive mind.
If Chtrax is present and aware of the PCs ap-
proach, the protection of the phylactery is of 
paramount importance. He snatches the phylactery 
from its stand and casts as many spells as he can 
before the PCs enter.
Chtrax uses cloudkill to control the terrain of the 
encounter. If he has the chance, he uses animate 
dead to provide a distraction, as combining zombie 
troops with cloudkill is a lethal combination, since 
zombies are immune to the poison. Chtrax saves 
his polymorph for opposing spellcasters, preferring 
to change them into peacocks. If an encounter 
turns against him, Chtrax does not hesitate to 
flee. He never forfeits his life for mere formians. If 
prevented from fleeing, he uses his offensive spells, 
using his staff of fire if necessary.
If Chtrax dies, the phylactery vanishes, freeing 
the formians from the xill’s hold and having results 
as described in this region’s Introduction. However, 
the digging continues. The tarrasque, driven by the 
commands of the derro savant controlling it, con-
tinues to press forward unless somehow stopped. 
On the other hand, the tunnels descend into 
bloody death traps, with formians killing derros and 
dwarves, stone giants attacking the derro, and the 
bulette and other monsters rampaging. All truesil-
ver extraction halts, and the gnome in Room D53 
ceases production of the mining equipment and 
emerges to seize control over Rooms D57 to D61. If 
the PCs do not stop the tarrasque, the devils break 
free on schedule and sweep through the tunnels 
bent on genocide.
If the PCs or tremors destroy this room and 
Room D48, check to see if Chtrax was present. If he 
was, he escapes with the phylactery to Room D61, 
where he remains until Day 7. If he was not present, 
the destruction of the building destroys the phylac-
tery and the formians act as described above.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If present, and allowed time to prepare, 
he casts the following spells in order: expeditious 
retreat, stoneskin, and greater invisibility. When the 
PCs enter the room, he then casts cone of cold, 
targeting as many PCs as he can. On the following 
round, he flees, alerting the entire Great Hall. If 
combat becomes unavoidable, Chtrax strikes from 
surprise, using greater invisibility, spider climb and 
haste to first observe his foe and then strike from 
unexpected angles.
All surviving unattached elite formian warriors 
arrive on round 3 and 1d6 formian warriors arrive 
every 2 rounds after, until all surviving members of 
the 30 unattached formians arrive. Finally, in five 
rounds, the formian myrmarch arrives to aid his 

317
leader. Chtrax takes any opportunity he can to es-
cape, fleeing to Room D61, where he remains until 
the tarrasque breaches the vault.
Treasure: Hidden beneath one of the tables is 
Chtrax’s journal and notes, written in Infernal. Play-
ers able to translate the book learn all the details 
in this region’s Introduction, including details on 
Asrakhor the Undying, the devil vault and Chtrax’s 
nefarious plan.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase Chtrax’s hit points by 30. To decrease the 
challenge, remove Chtrax from this room.
D50 . RUINED BUILDING
The shattered ceiling collapsed here, with nothing 
remaining of this building aside from a few broken 
walls, bones and rubble.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This building was a storage facility, but 
tremors collapsed part of the ceiling causing it to 
fall and destroy the contents. This building serves to 
clue your players about the Great Hall’s instability. If 
the PCs make a frontal assault, allow them to make 
a Wisdom (Perception) check to catch sight of this 
ruined building before they recklessly engage the 
formians. Of course, if they do not see the clue for 
what it is, let them die.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A

D51 . SILVER TRACK
A line of track runs on the floor from a circular 
building to a large exit. 
Initial Attitude: N/A or Indifferent
Encounter: Two stone giants push an ore cart laden 
with truesilver from Room D41 to Room D53. It 
takes one minute to move the ore cart from Trans-
portation and Inventory (D52) to reach the Gnome’s 
Workshop. There, it takes three minutes to unload 
them, and then eight minutes to return. The giants 
then work at the bore or return to their lair in Room 
D27. Typically, the giants make 1d3 trips per day, 
and there is always at least 1d6 hours between each 
trip. Therefore, there is a 30% chance the giants are 
at a random point, somewhere on the track.
The giants hate their work and are thus both 
slow and slothful. Should they encounter the PCs, 
they are indifferent and depending on the PCs’ 
attitudes, may or may not let them go about their 
business. Confronted with well-armed and danger-
ous opponents, the stone giants ignore them and 
go about their business. On the other hand, if the 
PCs are weak, the giants attack them.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Should combat occur, the giants attack to kill 
the PCs quickly and efficiently by pummeling them 
with slam attacks. If combat turns against them, 
they call out for help. If they start calling, roll for 
Random Encounters to see what happens or who 
comes to investigate. The giants will flee if one falls 
below 50 hit points.
Treasure: If the giants head toward the Gnome’s 
Workshop (Room D53), then their cart holds 1d6 x 
10 1-lb. bars of truesilver. Each bar is worth 750 gp, 
but if touched by a mortal, the metal transmutes to 
normal silver, reducing the bars’ value to 5 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each giant a single-use Action Surge. To de-
crease the challenge, remove one giant.
D52 . TUNNEL AND INTERSECTION
Following the rail, you travel down the wide tunnel. 
Words of encouragement, praises to the Master, 
and solemn reminders of duty echo in your ears. 
The exhortations continue from invisible mouths 
until you reach an intersection, where an enormous 
statue of a multi-armed demon stands proudly, 
with one hand on the head of an adoring derro 
servant, another hand on the shoulder of a proud 
formian warrior, with dwarves and derro groveling 
at his feet. The dark corridor grows brighter 
with flickering light to the right and sounds of 
deep rumbling and tools working away stone 
from the left
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A permanent wall of force protects this 
statue. Chtrax believes it to be a symbol of inspira-
tion for the derro and the slaves, and it pleases him 

318
to walk by it. There is a 5% chance Chtrax (Room 
D49) is here admiring his features.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D53 . LABORATORY
The tunnel opens into a large cave with 
multicolored walls, pieces of flowstone near 
the high, 30-ft.-tall ceiling with attached stone 
draperies. Crystal coral and gypsum flowers cover 
the floor, reflecting the light and presenting a 
dazzling scenario. Marring this natural artistic 
display are four cages hanging from the ceiling, 
each housing a half-starved and much-abused 
dwarf slave. At the far end of the cave is a small 
forge, shimmering in the light in the room. Several 
worktables hold mechanical atrocities, devices of 
unspeakable purpose. Against the walls, between 
the occasional stalactite and column, stands a 
half-carved granite humanoid, twitching as if 
alive. Emerging from the shadows is a petite 
humanoid with pale, curly brown hair, and a wry 
smile distorting his face. In one hand, he carries an 
overlarge fork, but instead of metal tines there are 
crackling electricital sparks.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Chtrax’s pet artificer, Korus the gnome, 
works in this laboratory designing tools and devic-
es to aid in the mining, the extraction of truesilver 
and whatever evil designs hatched by the xill tyrant. 
Though the gnome nominally works for the xill, he 
is not exceptionally loyal, and instead enjoys work-
ing and hurting others in the process. He keeps 
four derro and deep dwarf slaves in cages suspend-
ed from the ceiling as test subjects for his horrid 
experiments. They are on the verge of death.
Korus’ greatest task, one requiring vast amounts 
of truesilver, is a collar and manacles set he is 
building. Knowing the importance of these items 
to the xill, he hides them behind one of the stone 
draperies and conceals his progress in their manu-
facture. He feels once the collar and manacles are 
complete, Chtrax’s use for him may end, and Korus 
does not know if the xill will allow him the same 
amounts of freedom he has enjoyed thus far.
Korus does not attack immediately, though he is 
suspicious. He waits to see what the PC do or say, 
to assess their usefulness as allies or the threat they 
pose as enemies. If the PCs are amenable to con-
versation, despite the room’s sinister atmosphere 
and the nasty tool in the gnome’s hand, Korus ea-
gerly engages them in conversation. On the other 
hand, if combat erupts, the gnome throws a hidden 
lever on the eastern wall of the tunnel, releasing 
his pet digesters before hammering the PCs with a 
barrage of spells.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: With a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persua-
sion) check, Korus tells the PCs the following:
Chtrax, a powerful xill, controls these mines. He 
has easily assumed control of the region, especially 
after the flooding and subsequent chaos. Having 
murdered most of the derro savants, and with the 
might of his formian slaves, he enjoys complete 
control over the derro and their minions. The xill 
searches for something in the depths of the world, 
something called the vault, though what exactly is 
inside, only Chtrax knows. Of his minions, only the 
derro are truly loyal. The stone giants work for the 
master only because it serves their purpose. Even 
the formians serve through coercion.
With a successful DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check, 
Korus adds the following:
Chtrax’s control over the formians exists only 
because he has stolen the formian queen’s essence 
and trapped it inside a special phylactery. If you 
want to disrupt Chtrax’s plans, destroy the box 
and watch them explode. One more thing, beware 
the tunnels in the deeper mines. Chtrax controls a 
tarrasque and uses it to dig the deepest tunnels.
If diplomacy fails, Korus first uses mage hand 
to throw the lever releasing his digesters in Room 
D54, and then casts greater invisibility, moving 
toward the exit. On the next round, he casts expedi-
tious retreat and flees. If there are any survivors, he 
casts wall of force, blocking the PCs inside the room 
before fleeing to warn Chtrax. Korus, despite his 
power, would rather flee than face a band of well-
armed adventurers.

319
A SAMPLE OF KORUS' TOOLS AND OTHER DEVICES
Force Clamp: This tool looks for all intents and 
purposes like a small fork, but instead of metal 
tines, it projects contained force. These tools allow 
the slaves and derro to handle truesilver without 
touching it, or without channeling the mortal taint 
through metal. A force clamp is a viable weapon; 
it uses the same statistics as a club. Force clamps 
have all the characteristics and immunities as a wall 
of force, making them virtually indestructible to 
physical damage.
Forgefire: This alchemical fuel burns hotter and 
longer than normal fire. The slaves use it to smelt 
truesilver faster and more efficiently. Unlike alche-
mist fire, forgefire is a solid and does not ignite 
unless exposed to fire. Once lit, a half-pound brick 
of forgefire burns for 1d6 days. You can throw 
forgefire, with adequate protection, but as a stan-
dard ranged attack and not as a ranged touch 
attack. If it hits, the target takes 2d6 points of fire 
damage and must succeed a DC 20 Dexterity save 
to avoid catching on fire. If lit, the victim takes 3 
(1d6) points of fire damage each additional round 
but may extinguish the flames by succeeding a DC 
15 Dexterity save
Pocket Air: Created to produce a pocket of air in 
the case of a cave-in, this wondrous item looks 
like small blue marble. When cast to the ground, 
though, it shatters and releases a gust of wind 
originating from the point of impact caused by the 
introduction of 300 cubic ft. of new fresh air. One 
can throw pocket air with 10-ft. range increments, 
up to 50 ft. In sealed spaces, the new air fills the 
available space and stops.
Softlight: When spread out onto a flat surface, this 
purple dust ignites. It burns but generates no heat. 
Furthermore, its luminescence does not affect crea-
tures with light sensitivity but is still enough light to 
cast light equivalent to bright light in a 5 ft. radius 
and dim lighting 10 ft. beyond. Softlight burns for 
8 hours. Once lit, you cannot move it, nor does it 
ignite other combustibles. 
Sounder: This unusual device looks more like a laden 
cart than a digging tool. Measuring 10 ft. long, the 
sounder rolls about on a flatbed atop six wheels. 
The mechanism consists of a 4-ft. wide metal cylin-
drical tank mounted in an iron cradle. Coolant hos-
es pump into the tank to its water reservoir, where 
it cools its magical processes venting the steam 
from the top. The rear of the tank houses the opera-
tion assembly. There, four levers move up and down 
to control the depth, height and width and intensity 
of the probing pulse (the greater the intensity, the 
The digesters, unfailingly loyal to their wicked 
master, open combat with a spray of acid, cross-
ing each other’s cones for maximum effect. If an 
opponent is particularly troublesome, surviving 
digesters use concentrated streams on the most 
threatening foes.
Killing the gnome avails the PCs little, for the 
manacles and collar are complete. If the PCs do 
not find and destroy these items, Chtrax has a 20% 
chance of finding them each day. For the PCs to 
destroy the items, simply touching them is enough, 
or if Chtrax fails to find them, he automatically 
fails to capture Kator on the seventh day when the 
tarrasque breaches the vault.
The captured slaves all carry xill eggs and they 
succumb to the infestation in 1d6 days. Up until 
the xill eggs hatch, they will aid the PCs in whatever 
capacity they can.
Treasure: Aside from the gnome’s personal posses-
sions, he has a wide assortment of his creations. 
Hidden behind a stone drapery (DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check) are the truesilver collar and 
manacles. Mortal hands touching these items 
destroy their magical properties, and these items 
become nothing more than mundane, albeit silver, 
items. Scattered throughout the room are three 
force clamps, six rocks of forgefire, two pocket airs, 
ten doses of softlight, three incomplete sounders 

320
(worth nothing) and one finished sounder. See the 
sidebar for details on these items.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
remove the spell level limit of Korus’ Cast Spell 
legendary action and add three more digesters. To 
decrease the challenge, make the Cast Spell legend-
ary action require two legendary actions, remove his 
Overchannel ability, and remove all digesters.
D54 . PEN
Piles of rotting straw and bits of bone fill this pen.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Four digesters live in this pen. If combat 
erupts in Room D53, Korus releases these monsters 
to aid him against his attackers. Otherwise, the 
digesters feast on the occasional slave Korus offers 
them, content with their fate as beloved pets.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: If the PCs somehow prevent Korus from re-
leasing the digesters, and his life is threatened, the 
digesters use their acid attacks against the gate un-
til they break out on their own. Once they engage 
Korus’ attackers, they fight to the death, using their 
acid spray attacks to hit as many targets as possible.
Treasure: A fist-sized diamond lies under some hay, 
apparently undigestible. It is easily worth 5,000 gp 
more accurate the results, but the greater the risk 
for the machine to malfunction). The tank has small 
bound wire leads running into the directionally re-
versed cone. The cone has handles to allow its ma-
nipulation and placement onto the rock’s surface. 
Three sharp spikes emerge from the front, i.e. its 
narrow end, and they automatically drill into a rocky 
surface. Depressing a button disengages the drills.
When activated, the Sounder sends an elec-
tromagnetic pulse into the rock, which magically 
returns once it reaches the specified depth, height 
and width. When it has pinged out and contracted, 
the pulse carries its information back to the reverse 
cone. Affixed to the fluted edge of the cone are 
seven lenses, tied to each color in the visible light 
spectrum. The color determines the density of the 
rock, where red is the presence of an empty space, 
orange signifies it is filled with heavy gases, yellow 
water, green loose earth, and blue rock. The darker 
colors imply heavier deposits such as lead or gold. 
If the sounder pulse hits adamantine, it emits all 
seven colors. In wide pulses, many densities result. 
In this case, the brightest light is the dominant 
density, while unusual pockets and anomalies may 
register as only a flicker. The best pulses are the 
high intensity, narrow beams. A pulse can extend 50 
ft. into rock, with a 50 ft. width and height.
As mentioned above, a pulse’s intensity dictates 
its accuracy. A low pulse has a 75% chance of a mis-
read, firing a random color, but without a malfunc-
tion. A mid pulse has a 50% chance of a misread, 
but a 10% chance of a malfunction. A mid-high 
pulse has a 25% chance of a misread, but a 30% 
chance of malfunction. Finally, a high pulse has a 
10% chance of a misread, but a 60% malfunction.
If a malfunction results, an arc of electricity leaps 
from the sounder to ground in the nearest living 
target up to 40 ft. away, dealing 8d6 points of light-
ning damage, DC 15 Dexterity save for half damage. 
Chtrax’s obsession in uncovering the vault forces 
the engineers to use high pulses rather than the 
safer mid  or low-pulses. As a result, the sounders 
claim nearly as many lives as the cave-ins.
Truesilver Collar and Manacles: Forged from truesil-
ver and never touched by mortal hands, this match-
ing collar and manacles fit a large devil. When so 
placed, the devil may only utilize his special attacks 
if the owner of the collar and manacles permits it. 
Chtrax commissioned these items to coerce the pit 
fiend Kator to give up his wish.

gence (Investigation) check.

ter, add four digesters. To decrease the challenge, 
remove two.

This narrow shaft extends some 40 ft. before it ends 
at a wall.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Chtrax, growing more impatient by the 
day, ordered the gnome’s workshop excavated to

D57 - D68 . DEEP MINES
This section is the vanguard of the vault miners. The 
center of activity occurs in Room D58, with connect-
ing tunnels branching off in several directions. The 
central chamber is nearly as vast as the Great Hall, 
roughly 100 ft. wide and 70 ft. long. Its ceiling rises to 
60 ft. in the center and 40 ft. at the caverns’ perime-
ter. The large tunnels branching off from the central 
cave, Rooms D59 to D62, feature ceilings 40 ft. tall. 
The smaller tunnels are almost all 5 ft. wide and 10 
ft. tall to accommodate the grimlock foremen. Room 
D58 is lit with softlight, but all other rooms are dark 
unless mentioned otherwise. The tarrasque’s noise 
imposes a -10 penalty to all Wisdom (Perception) 
checks to listen, and the dust filling the air imposes 
a -5 penalty to Wisdom (Perception) checks to spot 
things. Just like the Great Hall, this is a dangerous 
location, and subterfuge and infiltration are the pre-
ferred tactics over a frontal assault.
The greatest threat in this section is the tarrasque 
in Room D61. Tenuously controlled by a mad derro 
savant, this monster rapidly digs through the rock, 
excavating enormous amounts of stone and earth. 
The slaves bring the stone to Room D58, where delv-
ers, destrachan and others work to break it down for 
retaining walls, gravel or simple disposal. The spider 
web of other tunnels house digging teams of grim-
lock-led slaves. These miners suffer. Their lives are 
nothing more than 16-hour days of toil and death. 
Commanding this section is the second formian 
myrmarch, whose responsibility it is to locate the 
mysterious vault.
Combat with formians in this place has similar results 
to combat with them throughout this region. Once 
one group of formians engages the PCs, the en-
tire section goes on alert because of the hive mind 
link between all formians. Each room below details 
normal encounters and encounters when alert. ln 
addition, each room also details what reinforcements, 
if any, arrive to aid their allies. Though many rooms 
list the number of formian warriors who arrive in 
waves, there are only so many formian warriors in 
the area. The Deep Mines have 15 unattached form-
ian warriors, 5 unattached elite formian warriors 
and 1 unattached formian taskmaster. Each time 
the PCs engage in combat in one of the Deep Mine 
rooms, they undoubtedly draw more formians to 
their position as indicated in the room’s description. 
Strike the number of formian warrior reinforcements 
killed from those listed above. When the unattached 
number of formian warriors or formian taskmasters 
falls to zero, no more formian warriors arrive. You 
could move formian warriors from other encounter 
sites to engage the PCs, but those formians are under 
orders to protect their respective rooms. Regardless, 
the Deep Mines resume normal activity after an hour 
lapse between combats.
On Day 3, Chtrax moves to Room D58 when the tar-
rasque reaches the first adamantine bands. Thereafter 
he has a 10% chance to be in a random room in the 
Great Hall, a 50% chance of being in Room D58 and 
a 40% chance to be inspecting the mines in Rooms 
D78 to D80.
Destroying the myrmarch in Room D58 or the 
phylactery in Room D49 alters the dynamics of the 
section. If the PCs destroy the myrmarch, formians in 
this section suffer a -2 penalty to attacks, saves, and 
skill checks and lose their hive mind ability. Destroy-
ing the phylactery, however, removes the hive mind 
ability from all the formians in the entire region, 
telling them their queen is dead. The formians stay 
in their respective locations, attacking any non-form-
ians encountered, including the giants, derro, slaves, 
xill, and PCs. While in this enraged state, PCs cannot 
reason with them. All formians fight to the death.
Allow cautious PCs to move unmolested through this 
section if they do not draw attention to themselves. 
There are plenty of ways for the PCs to move, such 
as by skirting the edge of the cavern and remaining 
out of range of the inhabitants’ darkvision. Should 
the PCs make a direct assault, let them feel the full 
weight of Chtrax’s power.
If the savant retains control over the tarrasque, the 
tarrasque reaches the first adamantine bands on Day 
3, breaches it on Day 4, the second band on Day 5, 
the third band on Day 6 and finally penetrates the 
vault on Day 7.

D57 . ENTRANCE TO THE DEEP MINES
The track ends at the entrance to an enormous 
cavern filled with slaves, formians, and more. ln the 
center of the vast cavern, dozens of dwarven slaves 
are employed, hammering the rock into smaller 
pieces. Formians move through their ranks, their 
razor-sharp claws flashing in the dim light of the 
purple flames dancing on the floor. Branching off 
from this central chamber are numerous tunnels of 
various sizes. What is immediately obvious is the 
noise level, as across the tunnel, great plumes of 
dust and debris pour out of a tunnel. As you watch, 
a roar shakes the entire cavern, and all work stops, 
as formians, derro and dwarves alike, stop to look 
at the ceiling far above.

D58 . DIGGING NEXUS
Note: This is a very difficult encounter, possibly the 
most difficult in the dungeon. It should take several 
hours of game play, and we recommend GMs use 
crib notes before, during, after and throughout all 
stages of combat. Read and re-read this section 
before combat begins.
Loose rocks and gravel cover much of the floor 
area. From the connecting tunnels, emerging dusty 
slaves drag large rocks to a central site in the 
chamber, where the debris is thickest. Deep dwarf 
and duergar slaves hammer at the collected rock 
under a formian myrmarch’s watchful eyes.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This is the heart of the digging operation. 
Working the rock piles are 24 duergar and 12 deep 
dwarves. Overseeing their efforts are 8 formian 
warriors, 2 formian taskmasters, each with a dom-
inated destrachan, and a formian myrmarch. The 
destrachan use sonic attacks to shatter the larger 
rocks, while the slaves shatter the small rocks into 
gravel with mauls and picks or chisel them into 
blocks to use as buttresses for unstable tunnels.
Allow the myrmarch and the formian warriors 
Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the PCs. If 
they beat the PCs’ Dexterity (Stealth) check, the 
formians attack. They consider the PCs a threat to 
the operation, and worse as a catalyst for releasing 
the tarrasque on the rest of the region.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Echoes 8
Tactics: The taskmasters set the destrachan against 
the PCs and use their dominate monster ability 
against the PCs, while the warriors circle the group. 
The myrmarch uses feeblemind, followed by sug-
gestion before closing and engaging in melee. If 
Chtrax is absent and the PCs surrender, the formian 
myrmarch dispatches two warriors to escort the 
PCs to the region’s entrance at Room D6. If Chtrax 
is present, the formians give no quarter, cutting 
the PCs down to the last. The slaves keep working 
throughout combat, defending themselves only 
if attacked.
If combat persists for more than 3 rounds, 1d6 
unattached formian warriors arrive each round until 
all of the unattached formian warriors arrive. If 
combat continues for 6 rounds, the formian sen-
tries at Room D65 come to assist. The inhabitants 

324
of other rooms do not join, holding their positions, 
rather than risk the ire of the xill master.
If the tarrasque breaks free at room D61, the 
formians drive the slaves forward to meet the threat 
in a futile effort to halt the monster’s advance. The 
myrmarch sends one of the formian warriors to 
Chtrax to warn the master of the monsters’ release.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase each formian warrior’s hit points by +20. To 
decrease the challenge, remove one of the taskmas-
ters and rhe destrachan.
D59 . MINE
Working in this wide tunnel is a score of duergar 
slaves, slowly chipping away at the dense 
rock. Barking orders in Undercommon are two 
humanoids. Though blind, they are clearly aware of 
the goings on in this tunnel.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: Slowly digging through the dense tock 
are 18 duergar slaves, suffering under the whips 
and lashings of the grimlock overseers. They live 
to please their master but take no part in combat 
in the neighboring areas. Replacement slaves come 
from the Great Hall and other sections throughout 
the region. 
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Echoes 8
Tactics: No amount of conversation or bargaining 
distracts these workers from their task, cowed as 
they are by Chtrax and the neighboring tarrasque. 
A successful DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check 
panics the teams, who flee to Room D58, seeking 
protection from the myrmarch. If the PCs have 
already destroyed the myrmarch, they flee to the 
Great Hall and out of the region if possible. These 
creatures are no threat to the PCs, unless, of course, 
they succeed in locating the vault.

D60 . BIG MINE
A line of four formian sentries stands guard here, 
as clouds of dust and small rocks spew past them 
from behind. Beyond the line of guards, you see 
a mammoth monster of enormous proportions. 
Armored and bristling with horns, its massive 
claws tear through the rock with ease. Standing 
at its side is a bloodied and dusty derro, whose 
features are blank aside from a beatific smile.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: In a futile effort to curb the tarrasque, 
should he break the derro’s control, these four 
elite formian warriors (hp 102) stand guard. While 
they maintain a constant vigilance in watching the 
tarrasque behind them, they also guard against 
saboteurs who would throw the region into chaos 
by breaking the monster free. Given Souiji’s recent 
efforts, these guards are extra watchful. 
If the PCs approach within 10 ft. of the tunnel’s 
entrance, the elite formian warriors attack. These 
creatures fight to the death.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If attacked, these warriors alert the rest of 
the formians in the deep mines to the presence of 
intruders. Two move forward while the other two re-
main in the tunnel to prevent anyone from getting 
past them. The formian myrmarch at Room D58, if 
he still lives, sends one warrior to alert Chtrax and 
then joins the fight with his remaining warriors the 
following round. On the next round, any remaining 
unattached formians in the Deep Mines arrive. On 
the round after, the formian sentries from Room 
D65, if they still survive, join the fight.
If combat continues through six rounds, the 
mad savant in Room D61 comes to see what is 
wrong. The savant heroically joins the fight, using 
destructive spells. However, each round the savant 
is away from the tarrasque, there is a cumulative 
5% chance for the tarrasque to break the derro’s 
control. Worse, if the savant dies, the tarrasque au-
tomatically breaks free. Should this happen, consult 
this section’s introduction for details.
If the tarrasque at Room D61 breaks free, these 
formians act as the first line of defense, concerting 
their attacks in a futile effort to defeat the monster.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two elite formian warriors to the line of sen-
tries. To decrease the challenge, remove two and 
delay reinforcements by 2 rounds for each wave.
D61 . THE DOOM OF THE DERRO
Amidst clouds of dust and rock ploughs the 
greatest terror in the entire world. Great chunks 
of stone collapse and pull away from the walls as 
the tarrasque digs and digs. Standing behind the 
creature is a robed derro, whose focused expression 
belies his madness. The sound of the monsters 
digging is awesome to be sure. After a moment, the 
derro turns, as if somehow aware, and looks at you, 
a smile blooming on his face.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This encounter is both deadly to the PCs 
and instrumental to defeating Chtrax and his ter-
rible plan. Excavating this tunnel is the tarrasque, 
controlled by its mad master Rroliq. Through a 
well-worded wish, cast years before Chtrax ever 
arrived, Rroliq gained control over this monster, 
but only as long as it remained within 5 ft. If he 
ever leaves the monster, the tarrasque breaks free. 
Each round that Rroliq is more than 5 ft. from the 
tarrasque there is a cumulative 5% chance the 
tarrasque breaks free. If the PCs kill Rroliq, the 
tarrasque automatically breaks free and goes on a 
killing rampage. Chtrax, when he dispatched the 
savants, dared not touch Rroliq, lest the tarrasque 
destroy him. Instead, he allied with the savant, ex-
ploiting him for his powers over this monstrosity.
When the PCs approach this area, Rroliq starts 
casting offensive spells. He does not send the 
tarrasque after them, fully confident in his own 
abilities. PCs naturally want to defend themselves 
and may strike back against the derro. If they kill 
him, they have bigger problems on their hands.
Letting the tarrasque go wild is the surest way to 
defeat Chtrax, short of killing the xill. However, PCs 
ought to get clear as quickly as they can and avoid 
confrontation with this monster. If they are foolish 
enough to fight the tarrasque, let them die.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Rroliq casts spells with little regard for his 
own safety. First, he casts a fireball and takes a step 
towards the PCs. He repeats this tactic again on the 

326
following round, before falling back to lower-level 
offensive spells, saving a finger of death for some-
thing spectacular. Rroliq does not care if he dies, 
knowing the tarrasque will avenge him. If the PCs 
flee, Rroliq does not pursue.
Area of effect spells, like fireball, have additional 
effects in this tunnel, creating an earthquake on the 
ceiling directly above the area of effect.
As long as the savant lives, the tarrasque digs, 
ignoring the events around it. However, the sa-
vant’s death releases the tarrasque, giving it free 
reign to kill and destroy all it can. The tarrasque 
attacks the nearest creatures, snapping up unfor-
tunate victims with its bite attack and swallowing 
them whole.
Thereafter the monster follows, moves, kills, and 
destroys all it can moving along the following path: 
Room D58, Room D57, Room D52, spends several 
rounds leveling the Great Hall (this triggers cave-
ins each round), and then moves toward Room D32 
and beyond, widening the passage as necessary. If 
not stopped, the tarrasque moves out of the region, 
entering the lava flow from Room D2 to enter-
ing another region, laying waste to the dungeon, 
unless the denizens somehow rally and stop the 
monster. It continues its rampage for 1d2 weeks 
before finding a new place to sleep.
The surviving formians, if still under the control 
of their respective myrmarch and the phylactery is 
intact, rally to fight this monster, doing what they 
can to slow its movements. All surviving formian in 
the respective sections move to stop this monster’s 
progress. The derro use destrachan, bulette and 
any other creatures at their disposal to fight as well. 
The slaves, however, use this opportunity to flee, 
moving away from the tarrasque’s path and hiding 
in tunnels or the ruins of Room D7.
Chtrax has no interest in dying at the tarrasque’s 
mercy, and flees to the Western Mines, away from 
the path of destruction. There he bides his time, 
plotting to break into the vault some other way. 
However, it is likely the tarrasque destroys the 
entire operation, setting back Chtrax’s plans for 
years if not decades. If he knows the PCs are re-
sponsible, they have certainly earned his wrath for 
years to come.
On the other hand, if the PCs leave the mon-
ster alone, the tarrasque punches through the final 
barrier on Day 7, releasing the devils imprisoned in 
the vault. Rroliq dies immediately and a spectacular 
fight ensues between the devils and the tarrasque. 
PCs would do best to get away quickly and explore 
some other region in this dungeon. You can play 
through the combat, perhaps even letting the PCs 
control the tarrasque, formians, or even the hordes 
of shrieking fiends finally released after thousands 
of years of imprisonment. This could be a massive 
multi-night conflict, extending beyond the borders 
of this region, or simply a highlight, where you de-
scribe the events in cinematic detail. If you choose 
the latter, allow the devils to defeat the tarrasque 
after 20 rounds of combat before moving on to 
conquer the rest of this region. For more informa-
tion on the devils, their numbers, tactics and goals, 
consult the Vault, Rooms D81 through D84.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the tarrasque enrage as soon as the PCs attack 
the derro. To decrease the challenge, have the tun-
nel cave in once the tarrasque breaks free, requiring 
it to take 6 rounds to pull itself free from the rubble.
D62 . SOUNDERS
At the far end of this massive tunnel hums a six-
wheeled wagon carrying a metal cylindrical tank 
mounted in an iron cradle, with connecting hoses 
running to another reservoir. At the tank’s rear is a 
deep dwarf who manipulates several levers, while 
towards the front another dwarf holds a cone of 
sorts and presses the narrow end to the wall. 
Beyond the odd machine are two narrow tunnels. 
The sound of hammering is undeniable.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: A sounder crew, consisting of two deep 
dwarves, tests the walls with harmonic resonances 
here to see if they are any closer to the Vault. Six 
duergar and a grimlock overseer work in each of 
the narrow tunnels. The sounder crew, if left alone, 
turns on the device, to a narrow beam, high pulse 
with results as described in Room D53, likely arcing 
and killing one of the workers. If the PCs approach, 
the sounder crew alerts the grimlocks in the side 
tunnels, who lead the slaves to attack.
Encounter Condition: N/A

327
Tactics: The PCs can negotiate with the sounder crew, 
but a failed Charisma (Persuasion) check results as 
above. If the PCs improve their attitude, the deep 
dwarves urge them to leave. They know nothing of 
the Chtrax’s plans, although they can explain how 
sounders work.
Combat is straightforward. The grimlocks lead the 
van, charging into the largest body of the PCs. If 
the grimlock overseers fall, the slaves surrender. All 
the duergar slaves carry xill eggs inside them.
If the tarrasque breaks free, the duergar turn on 
their grimlock overseers, possibly hatching the xill 
eggs should the grimlocks hit or kill any of these 
slaves. The deep dwarves flee to the Great Hall.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D63 . SLAVES
Digging through the rock is a team of slaves, led 
by a grimlock, alongside a large, armored horror. 
Sharp rocks, dust and bones litter the area. They 
seem focused on their task.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A crew of duergar slaves, propelled by the 
lash of the grimlock overseer’s whip, slowly digs 
through the dense rock. Working in the narrow tun-
nel is a bulette and its derro handler. The handler 
and half of the slaves carry xill eggs inside them. At 
first sight of the PCs, the grimlock sends one of the 
slaves to fetch the handler and its beast, before it 
commands the slaves to attack.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: As long as the derro handler and the grim-
lock foreman live, the slaves fight the PCs, fearful 
as they are of their masters. The duergar enlarge 
and circle the PCs, moving to gain flanks against 
the spellcasters, while the bulette barrels into the 
warriors. The grimlock aids the bulette’s handler 
with their creature. If both of the leaders fall, the 
duergar flee to Room D58 to gain the myrmarch’s 
protection. If the PCs already dispatched the myr-
march, the slaves flee to the Great Hall and out of 
the region if possible.
If the tarrasque breaks free in Room D61, the 
grimlock and the derro handler lead the bulette and 
the duergar to help stop the monster from destroy-
ing the whole complex.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
make all of the humanoids infected. To decrease the 
challenge, remove the duergar slaves and foreman.
D64 . TARRASQUE NEST
This deep tunnel is a stinking morass of dung, 
rotting carcasses and cast off equipment parts. The 
stench is unbearable. Great rents in the floor of this 
cave speak of some enormous, clawed inhabitant.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This is where the tarrasque retires after a 
long day of work. Filthy and disease-ridden rotting 
body parts, mostly dwarven arms and heads, lie 
scattered throughout. PCs exploring this area are at 
risk of contracting filth fever.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A search through this area turns up some 
incidental items left by the tarrasque’s victims. 
Lodged into the rock is a large jacinth worth 5 ,000 
gp, a star ruby worth 1,400 gp, an emerald worth 
1,000 gp, and four pieces of tourmaline worth 400 
gp each. Scattered throughout the tunnel, created 
by the tarrasque’s friction, as it scratches against 
the tunnel, are 23 various-sized chunks of obsid-
ian, each worth 30 gp each. Beneath one partly 
intact corpse of a derro savant (DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check) is a fully charged wand of 
greater healing (action to use, 5 charges, 1 charge 
has the effect of cure wounds, 2 charges for a mass 
cure wounds).
Scaling: N/A
D65 . SENTRIES
Two insect men stand guard at this intersection, 
ready for anything.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Two formian warriors watch over the 
slaves in the tunnels behind them.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4

328
Tactics: These monsters immediately alert the rest of 
the formians in this section and attack any creature 
they encounter not a derro, dwarf, formian or xill. 
They do not negotiate, and they fight to the death. 
No one in the connecting tunnels comes to help 
these formians. 
If the tarrasque breaks free in Room D61, these 
formian warriors move to Room D58 to help defend 
the rest of the region.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase each warrior’s hit points by +20. To de-
crease the challenge, remove the sentries.
D66 . DIGGERS
The narrow tunnel opens into a small cave, where 
dwarves slowly chip away at the rock. Standing 
over them and gauging their progress is a blind 
humanoid with a drawn whip.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: A crew of slaves and a grimlock mine 
this tunnel. They attack any PCs intruding on their 
tunnel unless the PCs succeed a DC 15 Charisma 
(Deception) or Charisma (Intimidation) check. Oth-
erwise, the duergar attack the PCs, using their tools 
as weapons.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The grimlock knows nothing more detailed 
than the basic organization of the crews and teams 
working in this area. He also knows about the 
tarrasque at Room D61. The duergar, if allowed to 
speak, know a little, having heard rumors from their 
fellow slaves. They think the xill master is close to 
reaching some hidden treasure, and they mutually 
fear the outcome of his finding.
If combat breaks out, the duergar enlarge and 
charge, while the grimlock switches to his battleaxe. 
If combat goes against the slaves and their master, 
the surviving duergar use invisibility to flee.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
worsen the Initial Attitude to Hostile and give each 
grimlock foreman the fighter’s Action Surge ability 
(single use). To decrease the challenge, improve the 
Initial Attitude to Indifferent.
D67 . MINE
More slaves and an overseer work this tunnel. In 
an adjoining cave is a weird mechanical device 
manned by two deep dwarf slaves, connecting the 
machine’s odd cone apparatus to the wall. All focus 
on their labor.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: A team of six duergar slaves and a grim-
lock overseer are mining this tunnel. The device 
in the cave is a sounder (see Room D58), manned 
by two deep dwarf slaves. When the PCs approach, 
the deep dwarves turn on the sounder using a 
mid-pulse. Allow the grimlock to make a Wisdom 
(Perception) check opposed by the PCs Dexterity 
(Stealth) check. If he notices the PCs, he takes no 
obvious action and waits to “see” using his blind 
sight ability to figure out where they go. If the 
PCs leave, he ignores them; if they position them-
selves for an attack, he commands the duergar to 
the ready.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Should combat occur, the grimlock com-
mands his duergar to vanish, and the duergar use 
their innate invisibility ability to disappear, attack-
ing only when a PC happens to walk by them. The 
grimlock retreats to the sounders position and 
commands the deep dwarves to fire a high-level 
pulse as soon as the PCs close. These opponents are 
uninterested in talking and fight to the death.
Treasure: The deep dwarves have an intact and opera-
tional sounder.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each of the duergar slaves the rogue Sneak At-
tack ability (2d6). To decrease the challenge, remove 
the sounder and deep dwarves.
D68 . ABANDONED TUNNELS
This tunnel steeply descends deeper into the earth. 
Algae and luminescent fungus line the walls, fed by 
water droplets beading on the rock’s surface. After 
30 ft., the tunnel ends at a staircase spiraling down 
into a great black void. The scent of moisture is 
undeniable.
Initial Attitude: N/A

329
Encounter: Where this tunnel goes off the map, it 
leads to an underground lake filled with horror. 
The exact details of this site are up to you. The lake 
could be a flooded derro city, inhabited now by a 
powerful aboleth lord and his skum slaves. Alter-
natively, it could lead to more tunnels, with more 
derro miners working to uncover the vault. In any 
case, these details are up to the GM, and for those 
not wishing to expand the dungeon beyond this 
point, simply remove this tunnel from your map.

D69 - D75 . WESTERN MINES
The Western Mines encompass Rooms D69 through 
D75. These tunnels are all new and recently excavated 
in just the last few weeks. Unlike other sections in 
this region, there is no single center of activity; the 
tunnels are still in the exploratory stages, resulting in 
small groups of expert miners as opposed to massive 
networks of miners.
Chtrax commanded his forerunners to explore this 
section, lay track in the tunnels, and excavate the area 
entirely, but a large section collapsed, killing more 
than thirty miners, in room D69. Worse, a few of 
the deeper probes to the north, beyond Rooms D72 
and D75, released a flood of water, killing even more 
slaves and formians. Along with some unusual prop-
erties throughout these tunnels, progress has slowed, 
with many of the miners replaced by xill.
A single stone giant works the rails leading from 
Room D44 throughout these tunnels. He goes to 
the various digging sites, loads the rock, and takes 
the rock to Room D77, where the delver dissolves 
the rubble. The stone giant has no interest in fight-
ing and flees in the face of well-armed PCs. He 
does not interact at all and only fights if prevented 
from fleeing.
All of the tunnels here are at least 10 ft. tall, extend-
ing to heights equal to the widths in larger tunnels 
and rooms. The floors are treacherous, prohibiting 
charges and run actions. PCs moving more than half 
speed must succeed a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) 
check or fall prone. All tunnels and rooms are dark 
unless otherwise specified in the rooms’ descriptions.
On Day 0 through Day 3, Chtrax sends his minions 
to explore these tunnels and to excavate the rooms 
to find the Vault. After Day 3, however, he focuses 
on Room D61 and the tarrasque’s progress through 
the adamantine bands. Consequently, the supplies, 
guards and materials move to other areas in the re-
gion, leaving this area virtually abandoned.
If the PCs have not yet stopped the tarrasque in 
Room D61 and are exploring this region after Day 3, 
treat all rooms featuring mining teams, the rooms 
with deep dwarves, duergar, grimlocks, and or der-
ro, as empty.

section. From Day 4 or later, roll for Random Encoun-
ters once per day.

D69 . CAVED-IN ROOM
PCs moving down the tunnel to Room D77 and, suc-
ceeding a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, hear the 
following:
From the wall, you hear a faint scratching noise. 
You strain to listen, and think you hear cries 
for help. Trinkets, stone carvings and the like lie 
scattered on the floor near the base of a pile of 
loose rock.
Initial Attitude: Friendly
Encounter: An earthquake caved-in a large portion of 
the tunnels, trapping and killing many of Chtrax’s 
workers. Still alive and trapped inside this cave 
are 4 duergar and 6 deep dwarf slaves who ham-
mer at the walls for help. The sounds echo eerily 
throughout the tunnels outside. The duergar slaves 
joke about the sounds, but the deep dwarves leave 

331
offerings and secretly work at the walls to free their 
trapped comrades, when no one watches.
The slaves inside are half-starved, bruised and 
beaten. They lack the strength to dig themselves 
out and will succumb to the ravages of hunger and 
thirst by Day 5. The PCs can clear the rock and de-
bris where the wall is narrowest. A PC may roll a DC 
25 Intelligence check to find the narrowest wall. In 
one minute, without tools, a PC can clear rock and 
debris equal to five times their heavy encumbrance 
limit. With tools, they clear double this amount. 
Assume there is 3,000 lbs. of rock. 
The PCs may also tunnel through the rock. The 
walls have a thickness as indicated on the map and 
count as hewn stone. Alternatively, the PCs can 
use stone shape or similar magic to punch a hole 
through the walls.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Noises, Echoes 8
Tactics: If the PCs manage to break through the walls 
and free the slaves, the dwarves are friendly, offer-
ing to help the PCs in any way they can, even the 
duergar. The dwarves are equipped as below. These 
dwarves have the standard chances of carrying a xill 
egg inside them (see Region Introduction).
Trapped in a slide, and given their lowly status, 
they do not know much. They do know the general 
layout of the various sections in the region, at least 
by name, though they do not know much about the 
creatures dwelling in any particular rooms. They 
warn the Deep Mines house the most dangerous 
creature in the entire world and encourage the PCs 
to avoid those tunnels.

more tunnels lead out of this room. The floor is 
rough slate, and clearly treacherous. There are pits 
and holes in the floor, filled with black stagnant 
water. The floor clearly slants to the right exit. 
Black bones with bits of rotted flesh are piled in 
a pile near the left wall. Otherwise, this room 
appears to be empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room once held the campsite for the 
expeditionary force. When they breached the under-
ground lake, this room flooded, and some fearsome 
subterranean aquatic monster devoured the inhab-
itants. Now, just their bones and a few puddles of 
toxic water remain. Foolish PCs who drink the water 
must succeed a DC 16 Constitution save or contract 
Blinding Sickness. 
 '
Blinding Sickness. If ingested, make a DC 16 Consti-
tution saving throw to resist. Incubation period 1d3 
days, damage 1d4 Strength (rach time victim takes 
2 or more damage from the disease, they must 
make another Constitution save or be permanent-
ly blinded).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs moving down the tunnel to Room D72 
must move at one-quarter speed. Moving faster 
requires the PCs to succeed a DC 15 Dexterity (Acro-
batics) check or slide down the tunnel to land in the 
murky waters and the vast sea of green slime below.

D72 . WATER-FILLED CAVE
The steeply angled tunnel ends on the shores of 
brackish water that gently laps against the sand. 
The watery room extends back into darkness, and 
there are no other visible exits.

332
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was originally connected to a 
network of deeper tunnels, but when the miners 
accidentally breached the underground lake, the 
room flooded, killing scores of miners, derro, and 
formian guards. Now, this room serves as one of 
the two entrances for these subterranean realms. 
It descends 30 ft. to the bottom. At the far end is 
a tunnel leading to the watery tunnels. Unfortu-
nately, this room is also the home for an enormous 
colony of aquatic green slime, resting just below 
the surface of the water, unseen for all the water’s 
contamination. It owes its massive size to corpses 
of the drowned beneath its surface.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: PCs entering the pool meet with a horrible 
surprise as green slime coats their bodies. The slime 
fills the entire room, beneath the water.
 '
Green Slime. This dungeon peril is a dangerous vari-
ety of normal slime. Green slime devours flesh and 
organic materials on contact and is even capable 
of dissolving metal. Bright green, wet, and sticky, 
it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches, 
reproducing as it consumes organic matter. It drops 
from walls and ceilings when it detects movement 
(and possible food) below.
A single 5-foot square of green slime deals 1d6 
points of Constitution damage per round while it 
devours flesh. On the first round of contact, the 
slime can be scraped off a creature (most likely de-
stroying the scraping device), but after that it must 
be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing damage 
to the victim as well). Anything that deals cold or 
fire damage, sunlight, or a lesser restoration spell 
destroys a patch of green slime. Against wood or 
metal, green slime deals 7 (2d6) points of damage 
per round. It does not harm stone.
GMs not wishing to expand this dungeon 
should remove the exit at the far end of the Room.
Treasure: Beneath the green slime, at the bottom of 
the pool, are 6 adamantine picks.
Scaling: N/A
D73 . XILL CAVE
The tunnel opens into a wide and awkwardly 
shaped chamber. Hanging 2 ft. above the floor from 
hooked chains descending from the 30 ft. ceiling, 
are seven corpses of derro, duergar, and dwarves. 
They are all in various states of decomposition. 
One thing unifies them, though they all feature 
terrible holes in their chests.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Seven xill cling to the backs of the hang-
ing carcasses, feeding. When the PCs arrive, allow 
PCs a Wisdom (Perception) check to detect them. 
If the PCs see them and take any action revealing 
their awareness, the xill attack. Otherwise, the xill 
are content to watch them while they eat.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: These xill are aggressive warriors, driven to 
barbarism after a life in these tunnels. They give no 
quarter. The xill use bite attacks to paralyze their 
foes first and destroy those still moving before im-
planting their eggs.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the Xill’s melee attack bonus by +2. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the number of xill to 
just four.
D74 . DEAD END
Aside from a few bones and scraps of sodden cloth, 
this dead-end tunnel is empty.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Soon after the waters flooding these tun-
nels receded, a crew of miners worked to salvage 
the mines. Unfortunately, their grimlock overseer 
was a bit overzealous, and drove them with its whip 
harder than normal. The damage caused by his 
abuse triggered the xill to emerge early from their 
hosts. The xill consumed the grimlock, leaving his 
bones here, before pulling the corpses of their hosts 
to Room D73. Now, this tunnel is empty, save for 
the bones.

D75 . THE DROWNED GUARDIANS
Floating on the surface of the glistening waters are 
ten sodden corpses of dwarves. Where exposed to 
the air, they have rotted, explaining the stink.
Initial Attitude: N/A or Hostile
Encounter: If you would like to expand this dungeon 
to include subterranean depths of your own design, 
the corpses are deep dwarf zombies, animated by 
an aboleth necromancer living in the underground 
sea, and dispatched here to prevent intrusion. How-
ever, if you choose not to expand this dungeon, 
treat these corpses as just corpses, and remove the 
exits from the map.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If these creatures are indeed zombies, they 
move to attack as soon as the PCs come within 5 ft. 
of the shore. These creatures are mindless and fight 
to the death.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D76 . SOUNDER CREW
At the far end of this massive tunnel hums a six-
wheeled wagon carrying a metal cylindrical tank 
mounted in an iron cradle, with connecting hoses 
running to another reservoir. At the tank’s rear is 
a deep dwarf manipulating several levers, while 
towards the front, another dwarf presses a cone to 
the wall. In the smaller tunnel beyond are unusual 
creatures at work, using their cone-like heads and a 
loud sonic assault to erode the rock.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The odd device is a sounder (see Room 
D53) manned by two deep dwarf engineers. Four 
loyal destrachan use their destructive harmon-
ics to tunnel through the rock as directed by the 
sounder crew.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: At any sign of the PCs, the malevolent destra-
chan turn their harmonics on the party, while the 
deep dwarf engineers hide beneath the device.
The dwarves are terrified of the PCs and unswervingly 
loyal to Chtrax. They do not fight the PCs, but do 
not offer any assistance.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add three formian warriors to the group. To de-
crease the challenge, remove two of the destrachan.
D77 . DIGGING ZONE
This large cavern extends nearly 60 ft. across, with 
a ceiling just as high. Sifting down from above are 
constant streams of dust and pebbles, landing onto 
the back of an enormous cyclopean, an armed slug-
like creature situated in the room’s center. Duergar 
slaves scurry about feeding the thing rocks, before 
scrambling back before the monster’s bodily 
secretions dissolve them in addition to the stone. 
Two blind overseers lend an imposing physical 
presence and the bite of their whips to encourage 
the duergar to work harder.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: The massive central creature is a delver, 
who dissolves the rock chunks with its corrosive 
slime. It serves Chtrax, believing the xill holds its 
mate and brood hostage. Hauling the rock to the 
delver are ten duergar slaves and their grimlock 
overseers. The delver is disinterested in working, 
and so does not excavate the rock unless ordered, 
content to dissolve the rock brought to it instead. 
The delver remains here after Day 3, along with half 
of the duergar and one grimlock.
The farthest edge of the map may extend to 
more tunnels, more workers and other horrors at 
the GM’s discretion. If you do not wish to expand 
the dungeon, end with this room.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: When the PCs approach, allow the grimlocks 
Wisdom (Perception) check opposed by the PCs 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If they succeed, they 
order their forces to attack. The delver aids the 
grimlocks 50% of the time. If he does not aid the 
grimlocks, he either does nothing or sides with the 
PCs with a 50% chance of either.

334
The duergar enlarge and turn invisible, ma-
neuvering to gain flanks while the grimlocks drop 
their whips, draw their battleaxes and charge if 
possible. The delver, if it attacks, lashes out with its 
slam attacks against heavily armored foes, leaving 
the spellcasters for the grimlocks and duergar to 
deal with.
If both grimlocks die, the delver and the duergar 
surrender. The delver does not aid the PCs beyond 
this room, and instead moves toward the Great 
Hall to find its mate and brood.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each of the duergar slaves the rogue Sneak 
Attack ability (2d6). To decrease the challenge, re-
duce the number of duergar to five and remove the 
grimlocks altogether.
D78 . CONFUSED MINERS
The railed track ends up in a small alcove. Four 
duergar miners steadily dig a tunnel through 
the rock while a grimlock’s presence more than 
guarantees their continued labor is happening.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This crew of 4 duergar miners along with 
their grimlock foreman digs, unknowingly, toward 
the Great Hall. The confusing effects of the region 
have turned them around, and they can faintly 
hear sounds coming through the rock from the 
hall beyond.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs engage these miners, they fight 
to the death, thinking they are close to reaching 
Chtrax’s prize. The duergar use their spell-like 

335
abilities to gain advantage when able, while the 
grimlock battles the armored PCs.
Left to their own devices, the miners breach the 
wall of the Great Hall on Day 5, creating a tremor 
collapsing part of the ceiling onto a random struc-
ture. See Random Encounters in the Great Hall for 
details. After the tremors, Chtrax executes the min-
ers and their grimlock overseer, by dumping them 
all into the lava flow.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give the duergar slaves an additional damage die 
and +2 to attack rolls and give the grimlock the 
fighter Action Surge and Second Wind (1d10 + 5) 
abilities. To decrease the challenge, have the PCs 
surprise the miners.
D79 . MINERS
The railed track ends in a small alcove. A weird 
creature with a tubular mouth destroys the rock 
with a sonic attack, while dwarf slaves shovel away 
the rubble. 
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A destrachan destroys the rock with its 
destructive harmonics, while 4 infected deep dwarf 
slaves clear away the debris. These creatures are 
engrossed in their work, so are unlikely to notice 
the PCs, unless they draw attention to themselves 
in some egregious way. If so, the slaves and the 
destrachan fight to a suicidal death.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The slaves grapple the closest PC, while 
the destrachan uses its destructive harmonics to 
collapse the ceiling on the party’s rear ranks. If the 
deep dwarves gain a hold, the destrachan blasts 
them and the held victim with a flesh-destroying 
sonic attack.
The destrachan and its deep dwarf slaves hit the 
first adamantine barrier on Day 5. It takes them two 
days to break through each barrier. Therefore, these 
creatures eventually complete the xill master’s task 
on Day 12, but only if the PCs somehow stop the 
tarrasque first.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the deep dwarves with a derro handler. To 
decrease the challenge, replace the destrachan with 
a bulette.
D80 . RATS
The railed track ends in a small alcove. A rat swarm 
feeds on the carcass of a former slave. A light-
weight pick lies discarded on the floor.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: A lone deep dwarf miner thought of es-
caping from this region by secretly mining a tunnel 
into the floor of this cave when no one was looking. 
Instead, he found a nest of fiendish rats lying dor-
mant in a pocket in the earth. The rats boiled out 
of the hole and made short work of the poor dwarf. 
The swarm of fiendish rats is content to feast on the 
bones of the dwarf.
This room is empty after Day 4.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs provoke the rats, say by attacking 
or casting a spell, the rats turn on the lead PC, in 
a frenzy of bites and claws. The rats open with a 
smite-good attack, regardless of whether the oppo-
nent is good or not. The rats fight till death.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add six fiendish rat swarms that emerge on the 
second round of combat. To decrease the challenge, 
replace the fiendish rat swarm with a rat swarm.

D81 - D84 . THE DEVIL VAULT
Chtrax’s goal, the Devil Vault, is a nest of vile evil, a 
prison withstanding thousands of years, earthquakes, 
the rise and fall of civilizations, as it has never failed 
to contain the darkness within. Eons ago, before 
mankind stirred from the sleep of creation, Asrakhor 
the Undying, the Destroyer and the Void incarnate, 
surged madly in the planes and brought war to the 
heavens. Great celestial cities, infernal strongholds 
and even the halls of the gods succumbed in the 
clutches of his foul hand. Though the Nemesis’ de-
structive ability was a dire threat, his corrupting aura 
brought all manner of outsiders beneath his banner. 
From these fallen celestials rose a particularly cor-
rupted Solar called Kator. This fallen angel gathered 
to him a host of loyal followers and served the mad 
god and his fell purposes, laying siege to the gates 
of heaven. Thousands of years passed, with terrific 
losses to both sides. It was only when the good and 
evil gods joined forces that they were able to defeat 
Asrakhor and imprison him beyond reach in a cosmic 
prison for all eternity.
With the dark god at bay, there remained the 
matter of its servants. The evil gods demanded the 
destruction of these dark servants, but the good gods 
offered quarter, and the gods of light took respon-
sibility for their incarceration. The gods dispatched 
celestials to the Material Plane to construct a prison 
to contain these fallen celestials for all eternity.
The total area of the vault measures 140 ft. by 100 
ft., but the actual prison itself is small. Its size is 
deceptive however, for it originally held all 300,000 
of Asrakhor’s servants in a sphere appearing only 50 ft 
.in diameter. The sphere is actually a nexus to a pock-
et dimension large enough to house all of the fiends 
but encapsulated by a sphere of sacred force.
The borders of the Demiplane were not strong 
enough to contain the raw hate and evil within, so 
the celestial designers gave their lives to serve as 
conduits to fuel the energies required to reinforce 
the heavenly boundaries. The essence of four solars 
occupied the four corners of the vault, their inherent 
goodness enough to channel the energies of their 
divine creatures to buttress the magical barrier (the 
red lines in Room D81).
Even the sacrifice of the four archangels was not 
enough to guarantee the permanence of the prison. 
The builders coated the interior walls with truesilver 
from the natural deposits found throughout the area 
surrounding the site. Celestial craftsmen surround-
ed the vault with bands of magical adamantine and 
as long as those bands remained intact, they would 
generate an effect similar to a wall of force (the green 
lines, Room D82). Filling in the gaps are clouds of 
raw sacred magical energy, making the Vault inhos-
pitable for fiends, and lending to the magical imped-
iments preventing teleportation effects, plane travel 
and divination magic.
With these defenses in place, the gods and celes-
tials were confident in the vault’s defenses, and over 
time, expanded the dungeon, imprisoning more of 
Asrakhor’s minions, using inevitables, celestials and 
more to safeguard the world from the evil inside 
the massive dungeon. Eventually, the gods and the 
forces of good forgot about the massive complex, 
as their attention turned to the affairs of mortals 
and creation.
Now, Chtrax threatens the vault’s integrity, press-
ing forward with his minions. As he draws closer to 
his goals, the wards and defenses gradually fail until 
ultimately, when the tarrasque breaches the walls, 
the prison collapses, releasing Kator into the world 
once more. As noted in the introduction, if the PCs 
do nothing to stop the tarrasque, it breaches the first 
set of adamantine bands on Day 4, collapsing two of 
the walls of force and depleting the sacred energies 
within. The impediment on divination magic ends. 
On Day 5, the tarrasque breaches the second band 
of adamantine, collapsing another wall of force. The 
impediments on teleportation end in this region. On 
Day 6, the tarrasque breaks through the final ada-
mantine band, and the final wall of force collapses, 
dispersing all of the sacred energies and ending the 
plane travel impediments in this region. Finally, on 
Day 7, the tarrasque breaks inside rhe Devil Vault. 
With the vaults integrity destroyed, the solars’ essenc-
es fail and the reinforcement to the magical barri-
er collapses entirely. The sphere warps and twists, 
collapsing completely after 3 rounds, returning the 
devils to the Material Plane. Chtrax cannot place the 
collar and manacles on Kator before the devil and his 
legions overwhelm him.
As soon as the devils break free, they fight the tar-
rasque, led by the infamous Kator, with a mixture of 
spell-like abilities and the devils’ abilities to summon 

337
more of their kind. They quickly overrun the tarrasque 
and punch through the formian defenses, spilling 
throughout the region, slaughtering formians, derro, 
dwarves and other living things they encounter along 
the way. After one day, the devils conquer the entire 
region, and plot to conquer the rest of the dun-
geon. After two more weeks of feasting and terrible 
hunting, the army of devils march on the neighbor-
ing regions.
The release of the devils has a dynamic effect on 
the rest of this region. During the day of the devil 
raids, all the devils use their summon abilities to draw 
more of their kind into the region. They move quickly 
throughout the complex.
FOLLOW THIS TIMELINE:
Hours 0 to 3
Devils gain control of the 
Deep Mines.
Hours 4 to 5Devils conquer the Great Hall.
Hour 6
Devils take the Western and 
Northern Mines.
Hour 7Devils take the Old Mines.
Once the devils conquer the region, replace the 
inhabitants with the following creatures, regardless of 
whether the PCs defeated the original inhabitants.
The only way the PCs can save the day is to take 
the truesilver manacles and collar and place them on 
Kator. This is exceptionally difficult, as the pit fiend 
never sleeps and has no interest in wearing them. 
The PCs must ensnare the devil though a magic circle, 
or defeat the creature in combat, dealing nonlethal 
damage until he falls unconscious or is defeated in 
some other way. If they position the manacles and 
collar on the devil, they can use its wish to return all 
of the devils to prison. Be as lenient as possible on 
the wish’s wording unless the PCs are foolish enough 
to use the wish for themselves. If the PCs fail, what 
happens is up to the GM. Perhaps the gods return 
their attention to the lost prison and exert their influ-
ence to restore the devils to their prison. On the oth-
er hand, Kator could simply leave the dungeon from 
this region and unleash the Nemesis onto the Planes 
once more, for a campaign of epic proportions.

D85 - D103 . NORTHERN MINES
Encompassing Rooms D85 through D103, these 
blighted tunnels are a deadly gauntlet of pestilence, 
where despite the ravaging plagues wreaking havoc 
throughout, some mining continues. The traps are 
aplenty, lying in wait for interlopers who have no 
business exploring these tunnels. Commanding these 
mines is a tired and nearly broken formian myr-
march, whose control is tenuous at best. Fighting the 
plagues ravaging the tunnels has been no small feat 
and has claimed the lives of countless slaves, derro 
and formians. Making matters worse, a band of xill 
have organized and ambush miners, and formian 
sentries, stall the process for some esoteric purpose.
In a rare meeting between Chtrax and the myr-
march, the xill commanded the myrmarch’s forces to 
construct a bore to assist in the mining process, as 
the master was dissatisfied with the progress. Fur-
thermore, Chtrax did not intend to reveal this proj-
ect to the gnome, as it would create undue conflict 
between the artificer and the master. The command 
came three weeks ago, before the plagues and xill 
strikes. Hence, progress on the bore has been slow.
Unlike the other two formian myrmarchs, this one 
suspects the formian queen is dead at the hands of 
their master. If the PCs demonstrate evidence of 
this, and with some smooth talking, the myrmarch 
throws his lot in with the PCs to defeat the xill over-
lord. However, if the PCs betray him, he becomes 
an implacable enemy and hunts the PCs throughout 
the region.
All rooms here are dark unless otherwise specified. 
The walls are unworked stone and the ceiling aver-
ages 10 ft. in height, while smaller, narrow tunnels 
are only 5 ft. tall. Bones, trash, metal scrap and spider 
webs litter all the corridors and rooms, making 
charging impossible and forcing PCs to succeed a 
DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to run. The air is 
sulfurous and foul.

D86 . MOLDY ROOM
As you move further down the corridor, it gets 
colder. When you finally reach the mouth of the 
cave, you note a brown powdery substance fills 
the entire room, hanging in strands from floor to 
ceiling and covering the rocks. In the center of the 
room lies a gleaming longsword, in the grip of a 
dead humanoid. The room is exceedingly cold, and 
your breath puffs out in steam.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: When the waters poured into the tunnels 
from above, much of it collected here. The resulting 
moisture and the rotting flesh from the drowned 
made this an ideal location for various molds. Over 
time, the water evaporated, leaving a thriving colo-
ny of brown mold in its wake. The mold covers this 
room, so whenever anyone enters a 5 ft. space, they 
take 3d6 points of damage from each 5 ft. square of 
mold, for a total of 7d6 points of cold damage.

himself lost in the dungeon and finally crawled in 
here to die. All of his other equipment has long 
since rotted away, except for his particularly unlucky 
longsword, a -2 cursed adamantine longsword.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
replace the brown mold with yellow mold. To de-
crease the challenge, shrink the area of the brown 
mold to just the central 10-ft.-by-10-ft. section.
D87 . MORE BODIES
The narrow tunnel extends deep into the rock. Four 
corpses with large gaping wounds in their chests 
fill the end of tunnel. Their tools, picks and shovels 
lie scattered about, rusting. The bodies look like 
they have been dead for a while.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These bodies once housed xill eggs, but 
no longer. Two of the corpses were duergar and the 
other two were deep dwarves. Their jaws have been 
removed to prevent speak with dead spells.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Aside from a few rusty tools, there is 
no treasure.
Scaling: N/A
D88 . TUNNEL
Another small tunnel delves into the rock. 
Scratching noises sound from the darkness.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Three xill hide at the end of the tunnel. 
Newly emerged from the bodies of three duergar 
miners, they have just killed the grimlock overseer 
and are making a meal of his remains. If anyone 
enters the tunnel, the xill hide in the shadows, wait-
ing for the opportunity to strike.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The xill are merciless combatants. If a lone 
scout enters the tunnel, two make grab attacks to 
hold the unfortunate victim steady, while a third 
tries to inject eggs. Against more opponents, the xill 
lash out with melee attacks, but keep at least one 
opponent alive to act as a host.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add two more xill. To decrease the challenge, 
remove one xill.
D89 . CHUTE TRAP
For PCs searching for secret doors, or creatures who 
notice such things, read the following text:
Something about this empty stretch of wall is 
suspicious. Perhaps it is the scuff marks on the 
floor, or the flash of something behind it, but you 
are certain you spy a secret door here.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Designed to snare the snoops, this secret 
door is more of a trap than a passage. PCs succeed-
ing at a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
notice scuff marks on the rock surrounding the 
door, similar to claw marks. The stone door itself 
is poorly concealed, requiring a DC 15 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check to locate. The door spins on 
a horizontal, central spindle, but pushes on a false 

342
vertical spindle, so pushing either side of the door 
causes the top to spin forward, while the bottom 
lifts the PC up and into the chute beyond. Opening 
the door is simple. PCs pushing on the door must 
succeed a DC 15 Dexterity save or tumble to the 
other side, sliding down the chute to fall in a spec-
tacular splash into the lava below. See lava in this 
region’s introduction for details.
Once in the lava, 1d6 magma mephits attack the 
PC. The unfortunate PC can swim out of the lava 
to reach the lip of the chute, taking damage as if 
immersed each round in the lava. Climbing back 
up the chute requires a DC 15 Strength (Athlet-
ics) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The magma mephits attack PCs in the lava. 
They are nearly mindless, so they favor claw attacks 
over breath weapons. Each round the PC fights the 
mephits in the lava there is a 20% chance for 1d6 
more steam and magma mephits to join the fight.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, double the number of attacking mephits. 
To decrease the challenge, reduce the Dexterity 
save DC by -3.
D90 . SOUNDER
The large tunnel descends into the earth at a sharp 
angle. At the end of the tunnel, a large six-wheeled 
wagon carrying a metal cylindrical tank mounted 
on an iron cradle, with connecting hoses running 
to another reservoir of sorts hums as a deep 
dwarf manipulates several levers at the rear of the 
machine, while another dwarf presses the narrow 
end of a cone to the wall. Insect men stand guard, 
evaluating their progress.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: A sounder crew, consisting of two deep 
dwarves, tests the walls with harmonic resonances 
to see if they are any closer to the Vault. The sound-
er crew, if left alone, turns on the device to a narrow 
beam, mid-pulse with results as described in Room 
D53. The deep dwarf engineers are sick with cackle 
fever and frequently stop their detections while they 
suffer bouts of coughing. Furthermore, the disease 
has eroded their minds, so they have a 50% chance 
of switching the sounder up to a high pulse. Three 
formian warriors stand guard, watchful for xill 
saboteurs.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The PCs can negotiate with the formians, 
as the formians count the roaming xill among 
their enemies. PCs succeeding a DC 20 Charisma 
(Persuasion) check prevent combat from occurring 
and the formian warriors request the PCs to accom-
pany them to their myrmarch in Room D93. If the 
PCs agree, one of the formian warriors leads the 
PCs there.
PCs interacting with the deep dwarves must suc-
ceed DC 16 Constitution saves or catch cackle fever.
If the PCs engage the formians in melee, they fan 
out to gain flanks where possible and concentrate 
their attacks on the spellcasters first. The deep 
dwarves switch up the sounder to a high pulse in 
the hopes an arc will kill a PC.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the formian warriors’ hit points by +20. To 
decrease the challenge, have the formians start with 
a Friendly attitude.
D91 . DIGGING DELVER
Astride the back of a huge brown cyclopean slug 
monster rides a derro dressed in rags. The creature 
reaches out with its squiggly arms and liquefies 
the rock it touches. The air is acrid and foul. The 
mounted derro shrieks with pleasure when he swats 
his mount with his improvised riding crop.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly/Friendly
Encounter: A crazed derro rides atop a delver. Made 
even more insane by a nasty run of cackle fever, he 
is perilously close to comatose. With no concern 
for his actions, he commands the monster beneath 
him to find the prize at any cost. The delver, eager 
to find her mate who resides at Room D77, agrees 
in the hopes she can destroy as much of the region 
as she can. She tolerates the rider only because it 
serves her purpose.
If not stopped, the delver cuts a swathe across 
the dungeon, reaching the lava flow on the other 
side in 7 days.
Encounter Condition: N/A

343
Tactics: If the PCs make their presence known to the 
delver and her rider, the delver stops its dig-
ging. The delver is willing to talk with 
the PCs, but the derro is not. After 
three rounds of conversation, 
and if the PCs seem trust-
worthy, the delver crushes the 
derro, silencing him.
The delver is interested 
in any information the PCs 
have, especially details 
about what Chtrax’s 
intentions actually are. 
The delver does not 
know much, only that a 
myrmarch controls this 
section, and the formian 
workers spend their time 
constructing a massive 
drill. Once the PCs have 
finished speaking, she turns 
back to her digging, hoping to 
find her mate.
If the PCs attack, the delver and 
the rider charge the PCs, intent on 
destroying them. The delver concentrates her 
attacks at the armored PCs first, while the derro 
uses psychic thunderwave to disrupt spellcasters.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, change the Initial Attitude of the delver to 
Unfriendly. To decrease the challenge, remove the 
mad derro.
D92 . THE BORE
The tunnel slants down and opens into an 
enormous cave, filled with the din of industrial 
noise. Muted stone guardians stand at attention, 
blankly watching the workers toil. Duergar smiths 
forge the plates that the deep dwarf craftsmen 
shape into components for the large bore. Other 
slaves hoist the panels and other parts to the 
hive of activity, where formian workers labor to 
assemble a great bore. The cavern echoes the 
sounds of beating hammers, footfalls, and the 
occasional shout.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: Inside this half of the enormous cave, 
20 formian workers assemble the bore Chtrax 
commissioned in secret. Ten duergar smiths and 
their 8 deep dwarf assistants busily melt the metal 
fragments turned up from the rich iron veins in 
Rooms D101 and D102. Two stone golems stand 
ready to attack any intruder that is not a derro, 
dwarf, or formian taking a hostile action while 
in this room. Chtrax called for the bore once 
he lost patience with the gnome artificer Korus’ 
devices. The formian workers do not respond to 
conversation, though the duergar and deep dwarves 
direct PCs to Room D93.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: Should the PCs fight the inhabitants of this 
room, the formian workers alert the myrmarch at 
Room D93, who in turn alerts the rest of the section 
to the presence of intruders. The stone giants close 
with the PCs, opening with their slow effect, before 
pummeling PCs with slam attacks. On the third 
round, the myrmarch and all the formian warriors 
from Room D93 join the fight.
Treasure: N/A

344
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add an additional stone golem. To decrease the 
challenge, remove one stone golem and delay the 
myrmarch’s arrival by 1d3 rounds.
D93 . FORMIAN HIVE
Mounds of stone and mud cover half of this large 
cavern. Several insect men move among the mound 
conversing, antennae twitching. In the center of 
these creatures stands a larger and more powerful 
figure who directs the smaller warriors through 
practice drills.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: The myrmarch in charge of this sec-
tion resides here, drilling his troops and honing 
their abilities to fight against the all-too frequent 
xill raids. With him are 10 formian warriors and a 
formian taskmaster with a dominated xill. From 
the captive xill, the myrmarch learned the xill in this 
section are conspiring to replace all of the formians, 
using the slaves as hosts for their eggs. This has 
fueled this myrmarch’s suspicions that all is not well 
with the queen, and the deal between Chtrax and 
the formians is nothing more than a ruse. Conse-
quently, the formian has no use for the derro and 
plots to use the new bore against the Great Hall and 
disrupt the entire operation.
With the arrival of the PCs, the myrmarch’s plans 
are in jeopardy unless the PCs can convince him 
they fight the same fight. This requires a DC 15 
Charisma (Persuasion) check to improve the form-
ian’s attitude. If the PCs succeed, the formian 
explains they served the great Hive Mother, T’chtch-
eralaz, until the xill master met with her some few 
months back. The formian myrmarchs received 
instruction from their leader to follow the com-
mands of the xill as if they were her own. Now, they 
control the mining operations, truesilver extraction 
and security throughout the complex.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs enter the room, itching for a fight, 
they find one. A fight with the formians here draws 
the attention of the stone golems in Room D92, 
who arrive to face the PCs on round 3. The formian 
taskmaster sends the xill to fight the spellcaster 
PCs, while it tries to dominate the warrior PCs. 
Meanwhile, the warriors charge into the combat, 
working to gain flanks where possible, and to 
separate the PCs from the main body, while the 
myrmarch employs its spell-like abilities against 
chaotic PCs. The myrmarch and his minions fight to 
the death.
If the PCs slay the myrmarch, all formians in this 
section have disadvantage on all attacks, saves and 
checks. In addition, they lose access to their hive 
mind ability.
If the PCs befriend the formians, they can rest 
and heal here worry-free. The myrmarch refuses 
to make an assault against the Great Hall until the 
bore is ready. The formian workers complete the 
bore on Day 8, far too late to stop the devils from 
breaking free.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the formian warriors’ hit points by +20. 
To decrease the challenge, delay the stone golem’s 
arrival by 1d4 rounds.
D94 . ABANDONED MINE
Tools, junk and debris fill the end of this hot tunnel. 
There are no apparent exits, the trash is immobile.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Just as it appears, trash fills this tunnel. 
The miners originally dug here but stopped when 
they felt the heat from the lava. Otherwise, this 
room is empty.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Beneath the pile of broken tools, cast off 
bits of scrap metal and cloth lies a bone scroll tube, 
containing a divine scroll of resurrection, left here by 
a derro priest months ago.
Scaling: N/A
D95 . EMPTY TUNNEL
Loose rock and piles of dust fill this narrow tunnel, 
before ending some 25 ft. deep.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Xill raids forced the miners to halt work 
on this tunnel.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A

Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D96 . SENTRY
A large insect guard stands watch here, periodically 
looking into the room behind it and then testing 
the air with its antennae.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: A formian warrior stands guard here, 
keeping an eye out for hatching xill eggs, unruly 
slaves or any other disturbance disrupting the 
integrity of this section. He redirects any questions 
posited to him, back to the myrmarch in Room D93.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the PCs attack this guard, it alerts the 
myrmarch, if it still lives, in Room D93. Thereafter, 
it fights defensively, until reinforcements arrive. It 
fights to the death, regardless of whether reinforce-
ments arrive.
The myrmarch sends 1d4 more formian warriors to 
aid the sentry. These reinforcements, if the PCs did 
not destroy them in Room D93, arrive in 2 rounds.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a gorgon to this encounter. To decrease the 
challenge, remove the formian warrior.
D97 . SLAVE ENCAMPMENT
This large cavern rivals the one you just came from, 
but instead of hard-working slaves, you encounter 
mostly empty bedrolls, laying in neat and organized 
rows. At one time, this room probably held some 
50 or more slaves. Now, just a few dwarves recline, 
nursing injuries, or stealing a few hours of sleep 
before they return to work.
Initial Attitude: Indifferent
Encounter: Eight diseased deep dwarf slaves rest 
here. All have a random disease, as determined by 
the GM. The dwarves are not interested in conver-
sation, just rest. If the PCs cure a dwarf, they gain 
an ally for the rest of their time in this region. Oth-
erwise, these dwarves are no threat to the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (any) 20
Tactics: Count these dwarves as noncombatants. 
They do not fight and lack the means to defend 
themselves.
Treasure: The dwarves own nothing but their rags. 
There is no treasure in this room.
Scaling: N/A
D98 . DEBRIS
This small niche stinks of refuse. Its purpose is 
made clear by the hole in the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This place serves as a dump for trash. Ev-
ery 15 minutes the PCs spend in this room require a 
DC 18 Constitution save against disease.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (devil chills) 20, 
Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D99 . GRAFFITI
The railed track leads down a long and narrow 
tunnel. About midway down it is a vast painting, 
a caricature of a red-skinned, horned bug with its 
finger up its nose.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: In a small act of rebellion, some brave 
denizen painted a caricature of Chtrax here.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 6
Tactics: If the PCs can read dwarven they understand 
the crude but uninformative graffiti. Otherwise, it 
looks like a crudely drawn bug with demon horns.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A

D100 . SLOPED ROOM
The track ends in a hot light-filled room, emanating 
warmth from luminescent fungi growing on the 
walls. The floor steeply descends to two tunnels 
branching off into the darkness.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Hot geothermal gases formed this 
unusual cave. The moisture lent an atmosphere 
hospitable to these harmless and glowing plants. 
Weeks ago, the miners came across this place and 
continued to dig deeper into the earth. What they 
did not realize was the weird atmosphere in this 
room weakened their immune system, imposing a 
-4 penalty to all saves against disease. As a result, 
many of the miners succumbed to an outbreak of 
disease, spread by poor water and stale air.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: PCs making a lot of noise here may attract 
the attention of the xill lurking in the tunnels of 
Rooms D101 and D102. Allow the xill to make 
Wisdom (Perception) checks opposed by the PCs 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If they succeed, the xill 
emerge in 1d2 rounds to investigate.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D101 . MINE TUNNEL
This narrow tunnel extends nearly thirty feett 
before branching into two more tunnels, ending 
in darkness.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Hidden in the shadows of this tunnel are 
eight xill. These creatures frequently make raids 
against the dwarves and formian in Rooms D92 and 
D93, but between combats, they return here to rest. 
These xill have designs on taking over the entire 
region, one section at a time.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If the xill hear the PCs in Room D100, or if 
the PCs enter their tunnels, the xill creep forward as 
quietly as they can to ambush the PCs. These xill are 
relatively young and are not very intelligent. They 
fight to the death, trying to implant as many eggs 
as they can.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
make one of the xill an 8th-level wizard. To decrease 
the challenge, remove two xill.
D102 . MINE
This tunnel is as quiet as it is dark. It extends some 
30 feet before it branches into two more tunnels 
ending in darkness.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These tunnels are empty, cleared by the 
neighboring xill.
Encounter Condition: [Ambush], Echoes 6
Tactics: If a Random Encounter occurs here, it gains 
the benefit of the Ambush Encounter Condition.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
D103 . BURIAL VAULT
The air quickly sours as you round the corner. 
At the end of the tunnel is a wide room filled 
with corpses, twitching with vermin. Three odd 
reptilian creatures spew viscous streams of fluid 
onto the bodies, causing smoke to rise where the 
droplets fall.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: When a slave in this section dies, the 
dwarves carry the corpse to this room to be dis-
solved by the three digesters. The digesters are 
always listening for the approach of fresh bodies 
but have learned not to attack formians or dwarves.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If a formian or dwarf accompanies the PCs, 
the digesters do not attack. Otherwise, all three 
digesters turn their acid spray onto the PCs. After-
wards, they charge into melee, attacking the closest 
PC first. The digesters use their acid spray as often 
as possible, fighting until they are reduced to 18 
hit points or less. They then retreat into the deeper 
recesses of the cave.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the hit points of the digesters by +20. To 
decrease the challenge, remove one digester.
