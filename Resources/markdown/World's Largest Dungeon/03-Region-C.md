# Region C

Region C . 
The Final Option
This entire region was designed specifically to hold 
a powerful demon, Falortuligo (Room C21). Though 
this cell was of primordial importance, several groups 
of minor demons and lesser undead were also held 
prisoner here. When the cataclysm that shook the 
entire dungeon struck, most of these foul minions 
escaped, but the special cell in which the mighty 
demon lord was imprisoned remained completely 
intact. Over the years, several groups of explorers and 
settlers came to the region, but the great demon’s cell 
remained undisturbed and undiscovered.
Approximately 50 years ago, the last remnants of 
the Order of Myruun (an ancient minor goddess of 
the oceans, travel, and vigilance) were summoned 
here for mysterious reasons then only known to 
Myruun. It is still possible to piece together much of 
what happened during their stay, for the remnants 
and records of the forgotten Paladins of Myruun can 
be found buried here. Most of these fragments of 
information are well hidden, but clues are scattered 
throughout the region.
Perhaps sensing the weakening of the prison wards, 
Myruun instructed her remaining worshippers and 
servants to assemble in this region of the dungeon. 
No one knew why they were brought together in the 
bowels of this forgotten place, save the fact that they 
would be instrumental in turning the tide at some 
undetermined moment. Most were paladins and 
priests of some acclaim. Only the wizard Arum ar-
rived without being summoned, claiming he dreamt 
of his “destiny” and had to come here. When the final 
pilgrim arrived, 41 men and women occupied the 
garrison established in Rooms C1-C19. It was widely 
believed by those 41 inhabitants that they were the 
last in the line of the tradition of worshiping Myruun, 
and so they waited without further explanation.
When the prison vault of Falortuligo (Room C21) 
was broken open, Myruun revealed her plans to her 
minions. With the exception of Arum, they were 
asked to give their lives to fight the powerful demon 
that had escaped. Arum’s perspective of the battle is 
recorded in only one place. It is the sole account of 
the last battle and subsequent demise of the servants 
of Myruun, as Arum was its only living witness. The 

207
207
wizard’s account can be found in Room C64 (see the 
Path of the Righteous section for further details).
It is important to note that ethereal travel is pos-
sible in the area surrounding Room C4, due to a 
powerful experiment performed by the wizard Arum 
a few months after he arrived. The boundaries of this 
ethereal pocket are roughly 100 ft. in every direction 
from the altar in Room C4 and are clearly visible if 
the subject can see objects in the ethereal plane.
C1-C19 . FORGOTTEN PALADIN GARRISON
When the knights, paladins, and priests of Myruun 
were summoned to the dungeon, they established 
a base of operation for their garrison in Rooms C1 
though C19. Evidence of their passage is obvious 
throughout the area.
Myruun (a minor goddess of the oceans, travel, and 
vigilance) had summoned her last worshippers to this 
region of the vast dungeon prison. At the time, those 
who answered the goddess’ call did not know what 
was expected of them. They lived here for more than 
three years, until one day their purpose was finally 
revealed to them, just moments before the vile de-
mon imprisoned in Room C21 broke free. To the last, 
the servants of the goddess Myruun willingly gave up 
their lives to aid an angel in destroying the demon 
called Falortuligo. None but the wizard Arum (who 
was with the devout, but was not one of them) knew 
of their sacrifice: were it not for the brave men and 
women of the Order of Myruun, the demon would 
have unleashed its wrath upon the world.

C1    . FORGOTTEN GUARDROOM
A broken cable lies amidst the crumbled and 
disheveled remains of this otherwise empty room. 
Oddly enough, this room is not saturated with the 
same dust as others in the area. It is eerily quiet 
and the walls are unwashed.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The Order of Myruun once used this 
chamber as a guard post. Aside from the rod (see 
Treasure), however, this room contains nothing of 
interest or value.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A PC who succeeds at a DC 14 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check finds a rod under the table. 
A further DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
notes that the craftsmanship on the rod is of mas-
terwork quality. Anyone making a DC 17 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check learns that this rod was transmuted 
into wood from some sort of metal. It was actually 
a rod of silence (cast a 2nd-level silence once per 
day without using a spell slot. Does not require 
attunement). Nothing short of a wish spell can 
restore it, and the rod is completely non-magical 
unless restored.

C3. ETHEREAL FILCHER'S LAIR
PCs succeeding at a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check notice the floor in front of the secret door is 
worn. The solid stone door itself is otherwise indistin-
guishable from the wall. The massive door spins on a 
vertical, central spindle so pushing the left side of the 
door, for example, causes the right side of it to swing 
outward. To open the door, characters must make a 
DC 20 Strength check while pushing on only the left 
or right side of it. The broken pieces of a spent gas 
trap are the primary reason the door is so difficult to 
open. Clearing the debris from the doorway allows 
the door to swing freely on its axis.
As the door of this chamber opens, a fetid stench 
is released. Within the darkness, tiny flecks of 
reflected light sparkle and shine. A closer look 
reveals a dark shape moving slowly, as more 
twinkling lights appear.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This is the home of a Large ethereal 
filcher. The creature arrived at the prison sometime 
after the wizard Arum’s successful experiment. It 
has gathered quite a collection of coins, gems, bau-
bles, and other shiny objects over the years. Though 
it can travel outside the ethereal pocket, its survival 
instincts prevent it from leaving for extended peri-
ods. When the PCs enter its lair, it stands quietly in 
the corner of the room in ethereal form, waiting for 
them to leave.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), 
Concealment
Tactics: Though not particularly intelligent, this crea-
ture learned to use its jaunt ability very effectively. It 
remains hidden unless attacked or angered. If the 
PCs take more than a few baubles from the room, 
its attitude changes to hostile and it charges them.
Its favorite tactic is to use its jaunt to surprise its 
opponents. Between attacks, it positions itself for 
the best chance at surprise. If combat starts for any 
reason, the filcher fights until its hit points total 
drops below half. When this happens, it jaunts to 
another room and remains there until it feels safe 
enough to return to its lair.
Treasure: Though it is impressive to see this much 
treasure displayed in such a small space, it quick-
ly becomes apparent that the total value of this 
amassed fortune is less than it appears. A DC 12 

209
209
Intelligence (Intelligence) check estimates most 
items are colored glass or quartz, which brings 
the total value of all the treasure in the room to 
about 55 gp. Under the almost worthless jewels 
and trinkets are 5 old wax candles and badly worn 
vestments.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a second ethereal filcher. To decrease the chal-
lenge, reduce the filcher’s hit points by 30.
C4 . SMALL SHRINE
The floors and walls of this room are surprisingly 
clean but the most prominent feature is a small but 
old shrine standing neglected against the eastern 
wall. This simple wooden shrine is engraved with 
an ancient symbol.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The followers of Myruun used this small 
shrine to meditate in quiet solitude. Good-aligned 
PCs feel comfortable and at ease when they enter 
this chamber. All good characters that rest for at 
least one hour in this room gain the benefit of bless 
and aid for 1 hour after they leave the shrine.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check of the shrine reveals a folded piece of 
parchment slid into a seam near the top of the altar.
The parchment starts as a standard prayer writ-
ten to the goddess Myruun. A DC 17 Intelligence 
(Religion) check allows PCs to notice ancient refer-
ences to Myruun, an old goddess of oceans, travel, 
and vigilance. PCs making this check also know that 
Myruun is no longer worshiped. Near the bottom 
of the parchment the text trails off and a few short 
sentences were hastily written. These have nothing 
to do with the rest of the parchment. The sentences 
read “She calls at last! Gladly will I lay down my life 
for my Queen! She calls to us all!”
This parchment is a fragment of the Lost Pala-
dins’ tale.
Scaling: N/A
C5 . MAIN TEMPLE
An intolerable stench escapes when the door to 
this chamber is opened, temporarily dulling the 
opulence of the high-vaulted ceilings and painted 
walls inside the room. The powerful scent is enough 
to make even the strongest dwarf blanch in disgust. 
There is a horribly decayed giant bat corpse in the 
corner that’s causing the cloying odor here. A closer 
look inside reveals that the walls of this chamber 
are painted white but are dusty and a large stone 
altar is pushed up against the southern wall.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: The intricately carved doors leading into 
this room foretell the importance and prestige 
given to the temple inside. PCs outside the door 
succeeding at a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check 
hear wings flapping from within. Two giant bats 
were lured and trapped inside the room several 
months ago. Though only one is still alive, it is now 
maddened with thoughts of freedom.
PCs entering the room must make a DC 12 Con-
stitution save or become infected by Slimy Doom: 
each hour, an infected character’s skin is gradually 
covered in gooey gel.
 '
Slimy Doom. Immediately and at the end of each 
hour, an infected PC’s maximum hit points are re-
duced by 2d6. After each reduction, the infected PC 
may reattempt the saving throw, ending the disease 
on a success. Maximum hit points are restored only 
after the disease has ended and the PC completes a 
Long Rest.
PCs succeeding at a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) 
check confirm that the fallen bat died of slimy 
doom. The other dire bat is trapped here, which has 
made it angry and afraid.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: The surviving giant bat immediately attacks 
anyone opening either door leading into this room 
as it pushes to escape its cell. If it surprises the PCs, 
it attempts to force its way past, flying down the 
corridor outside of the room. Otherwise it moves 
into the doorway and attacks the closest PC, doing 
everything possible to prevent being sealed inside 
the room again. At the earliest opportunity, it flies 
down the corridor away from the temple.

210
210
Treasure: There is nothing left of value in this room. 
Even the altar near the south wall is empty.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have characters who start their turn within 5 ft. 
of the dire bat make a DC 12 Constitution saving 
throw or become poisoned from the stench. The 
condition lasts until they leave the room. To de-
crease the challenge, eliminate the opportunity for 
the dire bat to surprise the PCs.
C6 . FORMER ARMORY
The door to this room is locked and trapped. PCs 
who succeed at a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check 
discover poison smeared on the locking mechanism. 
Avoiding direct skin contact with the lock is the only 
way to bypass the trap. However, the poison coating 
the lock has lost potency over the years because of 
the moisture inside the room and previous attempts 
at picking it. Any contact with the poison causes a 
painful rash on the skin, regardless of the save.
 '
Locking Mechanism Coated with Contact Poison Trap. 
Detect: DC 17 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 
16 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools); Characters making 
contact with the surface must make a DC 10 Consti-
tution save or suffer 1d4+1 poison damage.
Picking the lock under normal circumstances 
requires a DC 16 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check. Any-
one picking the lock without touching the surface, or 
while wearing gloves, has Disadvantage on the check.
This warm and musty room holds many worm 
ridden wooden racks for weapons on its walls. 
Though a few rusty swords remain, most are 
useless because the leather bindings or wooden 
shafts are decayed beyond repair over the years.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Other than a few scraps of cloth and 
wood, this room is bare. If the PCs spend 30 min-
utes in this room, roll for a Random Encounter.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs succeeding at a DC 15 Intelligence 
check notice a masterwork quality metal warham-
mer head coated with a thin wax preventing rust. All 
the other weapons are either too rusted or dam-
aged to be of any interest.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the poison damage to 2d10. To decrease 
the challenge, decrease the detection and lock pick 
DCs by -3.
C7 . FORMER ASSISTANT'S OFFICE
Though it is easy to determine this chamber 
once served as a living room, the current state 
of disrepair implies someone took great pains to 
destroy everything that was not worth escaping 
with. Dark stains splatter the walls and floors and 
broken pieces of glass, wood, and stone are piled in 
a great heap.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This was the office of the second in com-
mand of the Order of Myruun, but the place was 
sacked long ago.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs wishing to search the rubble need to 
make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
to discover a cracked floor tile, broken when the 
room’s contents were piled on the floor. Under-
neath this floor tile is a space with a small diary 
and a holy symbol of Myruun. The holy symbol is 
attached to a silver chain with a broken clasp easily 
repaired with the appropriate tools. This symbol, 
which represents a flat round earth filled with 
oceans, is worth upwards of 250 gp to historians 
and members of religious orders interested in the 
history of the old goddess Myruun and her clergy.
The diary has writing on nearly every surface of 
every page. The first page has a rather verbose title, 
“ The Diary of Thomas Corsek, Paladin of Myruun 
the Vigilant, Lady of Travel, Queen of the Oceans. 
Being a diary pertaining to personal events of life 
and service as squire to my brother, Geoff Corsek, 
and my Queen.” Next to Geoff Corsek, the words 
“The Gold General’ were written and circled, as if 
added at a much later date. Written in much small-
er text at the bottom of the page is the additional 
subtitle, “And being a record of the Calling as we 
travel to a post my Lady has given us, to turn the 
tide as my Queen instructed.”
PCs spending at least one hour reading through 
the pages of the diary find many entries character-
istic of a young man who idolizes his older brother 

211
211
yet doubts his own abilities. The diary tends to be 
vague in reference to details about locations or 
dates, but rather specific about personal goals, 
religious rituals, and specific prayers as if recording 
these rituals helped to learn them. “The Gold Gen-
eral” refers both to the narrator’s brother’s uncanny 
ability to find chests of gold lost as sea and his 
quality as a leader of men. After the first dozen en-
tries or so, there is a sentence written in a different 
style that reads, “Though I am not worthy of her 
grace, my Queen has bid me travel with Geoff to 
stand vigil under the ground.”
PCs reading the diary completely and who make 
a DC 15 Intelligence check note the total time span-
ning from the first entry written inside the garrison 
to the last entry in the diary is nearly three years. 
This is another piece of the Lost Paladins’ tale.

C8 . FORMER COMMANDER'S MEETING 
ROOM
Another collection of debris is stacked in the center 
of this room, and the eastern wall is covered in 
black soot around the remains of the charred 
husk of the door. Despite the signs of fire damage 
coming from the next room, this pile of debris is 
built with non-combustible materials like twisted 
metal, broken stone, and mortar.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The commander of the Order of Myruun 
and his subordinates once used this chamber as a 
meeting place.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 6
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: This room has a floor tile with a secret 
compartment underneath it in the same position as 
in Room C7. Anyone specifically looking there finds 
the compartment, otherwise a DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check is required to uncover it. A leather 
parchment traveling case is hidden underneath the 
tile. It contains documents, two quills, and a vial of 
dried ink.
The documents contain duty rosters and work 
assignments for 41 people, as well as various maps 
of the lands surrounding the dungeon. Most maps 
have markings denoting the lines of travel various 
individuals took to arrive at this garrison. These 
maps are all external, stopping at the entrance in 
Region A. The interior map of the garrison area is 
notably missing, although the duty rosters clearly 
refer to it.
Scaling: N/A
C9 . FORMER COMMANDER'S CHAMBER
The door of this room is a heavily damaged frame 
that hangs upon a solitary remaining hinge. The 
area was clearly incinerated completely some time 
in the past. The chamber itself is blackened with 
soot covering the entire floor, walls, and ceiling. The 
pile of ash in the center of the room shows where 
an enormous fire blazed, long ago.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was the leader of the Order 
of Myruun’s private abode. But now, an athach (a 
3-armed, green-skinned giant) named Nurganar 
makes his home here. He moves back and forth 
throughout the region, so there is only a 25% 
chance of finding him here at any one time. If the 
PCs encountered (and killed) Nurganar as a random 
encounter, he is not here. If he is here, he is count-
ing his coins or organizing his belongings.
This chamber has a floor tile with a secret compart-
ment underneath it in the same position as in 
Rooms C7 and C8. Anyone specifically looking there 
finds the compartment, otherwise a successful DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to uncov-
er it. Nurganar keeps his treasure under the floor 
tile (thinking it safe there).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If battle ensues in his lair, Nurganar posi-
tions himself to defend his treasure. Though most 
of what he owns is worthless, he believes the shiny 
objects he collects are extremely valuable, so he 
avidly defends his treasure. Given the opportunity, 
he targets the physically strongest PC first, concen-
trating all his attacks on this one foe.
If reduced to 25% or less of his total hit points, 
Nurganar begs for his life, offering the PCs his 
treasure in exchange for their mercy. He does not 
ask twice, though and fights viciously if they mock 
or betray his good nature.

212
212
Treasure: Nurganar loves to collect all manner of 
shiny objects. Under a thick fur rug (worth 20 gp) 
in the corner of the room is a multitude of colored 
glass shards, glistening rocks, and a handful of 
semi-precious gemstones. Though the five gems 
are worth 10 gp each, the other items are honestly 
worthless to all but the athach.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, give Nurganar Sneak Attack (3d6 damage) and 
have him wait in Ambush (darkness). To decrease 
the challenge, have him return from a long jaunt, 
fatigued, with halved movement speed and Disad-
vantage on attack rolls.
C10 . FAKE DOOR
Written in Common on the surface of this 
otherwise normal door are the words, “WARNING! 
DO NOT ENTER! DANGER!” The letters are 
written in burgundy paint.
The moment the door is touched, a ghostly outline of 
a wild-haired old woman floats through the middle of 
the doorway.
The red lettering of warnings remains visible 
behind the translucent body as the creature moans, 
“This is now your second warning. You will not 
receive a third. Stay out of this room.” Even as the 
form is speaking the last few words, it sinks back 
into the door and disappears entirely.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The door was designed to fool creatures 
venturing into the dungeon. It leads to a solid wall.
The ghost is a programmed illusion that resets 
after 5 minutes. Anyone ignoring the warning and 
entering the room must succeed at a DC 25 Dexter-
ity check to unlock the door. The door handle is on 
the left side of the door, which opens outward. The 
wall behind it is painted completely black to height-
en the illusion of a dark and forbidding room, but it 
is nevertheless made of solid rock.

This small chamber is empty. A thick blanket of 
dust covers its floor, suggesting that no one set foot 
in this area in a long time.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The members of the Order of Myruun 
once used this room to store goods, but it is now 
empty. The lock on the door to this room is of par-
ticularly high quality. It was added by a locksmith 
servant of Myruun when the deity’s last followers 
were called to this region of the dungeon. Unlike 
most other locks in the region, it is made of silvery 
iron. The mechanism, in fact, looks brand new. Any-
one attempting to pick the door must make a DC 
20 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Most of the goods stored in this chamber 
were brought to Rooms C8 and C9 where they were 
put to flame, as the Paladins of Myruun knew they 
were all going to die and did not want these items 
to fall in the hands of evil creatures. However, small 
piles of broken glass collect dust in the corner of 
the rooms. In addition to the glass, there are 13 
stone arrowheads and a small piece of smooth 
volcanic glass with the symbol of Myruun etched 
on one side. PCs who succeed at DC 15 Intelligence 
checks recognize the volcanic glass curio used to 
have a pendant and be worth as much as 50 gp if it 
were fashioned into another piece of jewelry.

C13 . FORMER COMMON ROOM
A DC 27 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the secret 
door on the south wall. It is extremely difficult to find, 
mostly because it hasn’t been opened in hundreds of 
years. Anyone finding the secret door needs to make 
a DC 25 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to determine 
how to unlock it. The locking mechanism is simple 
but must be triggered each time the door is opened, 
but no special tools are required. Anyone succeeding 
at a DC 12 Dexterity check can open the hidden portal 
once they understand how to manipulate the device. 
No check is required to open the doors from inside 
the secret passageway.
This room has two doorways in the northeast 
corner. The door to the north has been torn off 
its hinges and removed from the frame while the 
one to the east is barred. There are hooks in the 
southern and northern walls at various points, 
indicating that large tapestries or paintings were 
once displayed there. In the center of the hall, 
metal fastenings are attached to the floor, as 
if a dining table had once been affixed here as 
well. Two broken chairs are tossed casually in the 
southwestern corner.

C14 . LARGE MEETING ROOM
PCs making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, or a 
DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discover that 
both stone doors are heavily detailed. The creators of 
the doors even added stone rivets and a simulated 
locking mechanism, nearly identical to other doors 
found throughout the dungeon. Even the stone bars 
fastened across the eastern door have a peculiar 
wooden grain to them. PCs succeeding at a DC 17 
Intelligence (Arcana) check realize the doors were 
changed into stone, underscoring the extraordinary 
measures taken to keep something from getting out 
of the next room.
Anyone attempting to open the eastern door must 
first lift the 600 Ib. stone bars from their slots. The 
top bar is set 4 ft. from the floor and the lower bar 
rests 2 ft. below the first. Once the bars are laid to the 
side, the door still requires a DC 18 Strength check to 
pull open.
The heavy stone door leading into this room 
scrapes along the floor until it gets stuck after 
three feet. The room’s interior is more barren than 
normal. Stains and scuff marks are visible along 
the ground and walls though someone wiped the 
dirt and dust clean. Another large stone door is 
found on the east wall, locked with two heavy 
stone bars.

C15 . FORMER BARRACKS
There are three more doorways leading out of this 
room, but the doors and frames are gone. The 
openings lead to other chambers, which appear 
to be the same size as the main room. Oozing 
through the doorway of the easternmost chamber 
is a glob of black goo. It is impossible to determine 
how vast it is because it completely covers the 
doorway as it slowly squeezes into the main room.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: About 20 years ago, Arum the Wizard 
trapped a black pudding inside this room after 
narrowly escaping its grasp. Guptu the Pale, an 
ogre mage who was a thorn in Arum’s side for years 
after the paladin’s last battle, had set an ambush for 
Arum with the pudding. Guptu and Arum faced off 
many times before the ogre mage was killed, but 
this pudding was his most deadly trap.

214
214
To contain the black pudding, Arum polymor-
phed the iron door and wooden bars into stone, 
hoping to seal the creature inside. He knew the 
pudding would continue to grow until it devoured 
everything in the barracks, but he also knew it 
would never escape on its own. In the event some-
one did manage to set it free, he cleaned the 
meeting room of everything the pudding could 
consume and sealed this chamber with another 
stone door.
The pudding is now so big that it fills whichev-
er room it occupies in the former barracks. It has 
consumed everything inside the chamber, includ-
ing the missing doors and hinges. But because it 
must force its way through the small doorways to 
move from room to room, it is slower than normal. 
It has a speed of 5-ft. and a 10-ft. reach. However, 
any pieces splitting from the host body move and 
attack normally.
PCs succeeding at DC 20 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) checks hear the odd sound of the pudding’s 
motion, like a gelatinous liquid piling up, or a slow 
scraping waterfall. The sound is coming from the 
central eastern cubicles.
Encounter Condition: Cursed 4
Tactics: By the time the PCs find the black pudding, it 
has already sensed the PCs and is moving to attack. 
It moves directly toward the closest PC, switching 
direction if the PCs run to another room. The pud-
ding cannot split itself on its own and only attacks 
in one direction at a time.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the speed and reach of the pudding by 10 
ft. and 5 ft. respectively. To decrease the challenge, 
reduce the black pudding’s hit points by 60.
C16 . COCKATRICE MAZE
The walls here are worn. Corridors turn sharply 
at random intervals or end abruptly. In addition, 
sound seems to soak right into the walls, muffling 
footsteps and speech.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: There are signs that someone attempted 
to dig further into the rock and stone near several 
of the dead-end passages. No tools can be found, 
but there are piles of dirt and gravel in the area.
About six years ago, a goblin from Region B got sepa-
rated from his raiding party and stumbled upon the 
secret door leading west. After going through the 
room, he found the cockatrice’s lair, was bitten, and 
turned to stone. The cockatrice entered the secret 
passage to ward off any other trespassers, but the 
door closed behind it. Since then, the cockatrice has 
wandered throughout the maze trying to find its 
way back to its lair.
Many wanderers have found their way into the 
maze since then, only to be turned to stone by the 
crazed beast that attacks everything coming across 
its path (see Room C19 for more cockatrice victims). 
The PCs should stumble upon the cockatrice when 
rounding a corner, as the cockatrice is most often 
found wandering this region.
Encounter Condition: Ambush
Tactics: When encountered, the cockatrice attacks, 
turning weaker PCs to stone. If wounded, it flees to 
Room C19, unless it is cornered. If given no chance 

215
215
to escape, it fiercely attacks the closest PC, until it 
has a chance to flee. The gargoyle in Room C19 has 
helped it fight off attackers in the past.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
allow the cockatrice to surprise the PCs or attack 
from darkness. To decrease the challenge, have 
the cockatrice flee to Room C19 at the sound of 
footsteps.
C17 . FORMER GUARD POST
The moment the door latch is turned, it swings 
inward as a giant guillotine-like pendulum attached 
to the ceiling descends. Inside, along the north wall, 
there are six nail holes some six feet off the ground. 
Resting on its side in the southeastern corner is an 
old wooden chair with three legs.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: PCs who make a DC 13 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check notice that the door is unlocked, 
but that there is constant tension upon it. Anyone 
making a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
discovers there is no way to bypass or disarm this 
trap but realizes that it can be triggered at a safe 
distance. The trap was poorly designed, as the pen-
dulum is fastened to the ceiling directly above the 
doorway. This causes it to slam against the frame, 
stopping its progress at the bottom of its arc of 
motion. The trap can only hit someone standing 
directly in front of the door.
 '
Ceiling Pendulum Trap. Detect: DC 15 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools); A 
character standing in front of the bladed pendulum 
must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or take 3d12 + 8 
slashing damage.
A DC 27 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the 
secret door on the north wall. This door is extreme-
ly difficult to find because it has not been opened 
in centuries. Anyone finding the secret door needs 
to make a DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check 
to determine how to unlock it. The locking mech-
anism must be triggered each time the door is 
opened, but no special tools are required. Anyone 
making a DC 10 Dexterity check can open the hid-
den portal once they understand how to manipulate 
the opening device. No check is required to open 
the door from inside the secret passageway.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Except for the broken chair, trap, and the 
secret passageway, this room holds nothing else 
of interest.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the trap to 5d12 + 8. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the damage dealt by 
the trap to 3d8.
C18 . FORMER SPARRING ROOM
Two great stone chairs face each other across this 
wide room, as if waiting for opposing generals to 
sit and watch their champions compete. The chair 
to the west resembles a sailing vessel, the back 
support being a large mast with two cross beams 
and the armrests tapering into the semblance of 
a prow. The chair to the east is shaped to look like 
a tsunami, curled back upon itself and preparing 
to douse whoever sits in its path. Both chairs are 
about 10 ft. in front of their respective walls.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This was the Paladins’ exercise room, 
as well as a place to hold contests for sport, and 
settling disputes. PCs who make DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check notice a faint 20-ft.-wide square 
painted on the ground in the center of the room. 
They also see the ground near the western chair is 
scraped and marred, as if the chair had been moved 
and left slightly askew.
The western chair releases a cloud of insanity 
mist if it is moved in any direction. Anyone stand-
ing between a 10 ft. radius to a 20 ft. radius from 
the chair is allowed a DC 15 Dexterity save to jump 
outside the poisonous cloud and avoid its effect, 
but anyone closer is automatically caught in the 
mist. This trap cannot be bypassed, but it is only ac-
tivated when the chair is moved. The eastern chair 
is not trapped.
Insanity Mist Vapor Trap. Detect: DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception); Disable: DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ 
Tools); Characters in a 10-ft.-square area suffer 
confusion for 3 rounds.

216
216
Anyone succeeding at a DC 13 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check values the chairs at well 
over 1,000 gp each, because of the unique 
craftsmanship.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
inflict a short-term madness on each character hit 
with the insanity mist. To decrease the challenge, 
allow each character caught by the mist a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw to negate the effects.
C19 . LARGE MURAL ROOM
Both doors to this room are open.
The rows of goblin and gnoll statues arranged 
in this room contrast with most of the stark and 
empty rooms found so far. There are also several 
murals painted on the walls, looking as clean and 
bright as the day they were painted. The art on 
the north wall shows a knight in shining golden 
armor, standing at the prow of a ship and looking 
out at an endless ocean. The west wall depicts a 
battle between a battered ship and a coiled sea 
serpent, as a bolt of lightning comes down from 
the sky to strike the serpent. The east wall shows a 
breathtaking picture of a beautiful woman looking 
out over a calm sea at sunset, as if awaiting the 
return of her beloved.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: The murals painted on the walls are mag-
ically protected, so it is impossible to erase them or 
dilute their colors. If the PCs study the murals, they 
notice titles written in Common painted at the bot-
toms of the pictures. The western mural is entitled 
“The Oceans,” the northern is called “The Journey,” 
and the eastern is simply labeled “Vigilance.” In 
addition to the titles, further inspection reveals the 
incredible detail in each mural. It is clear to every-
one that these paintings would be priceless if they 
had been painted on a portable canvas.
The statues in the room are arranged into four 
rows. There are seven gnoll, seven goblin, and three 
human statues in addition to the gargoyle that 
haunts the place. None of the statues in the room 
are on bases except for the gargoyle standing on 
a square stone block in the second row from the 
west. Anyone examining the statues can make a DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check to realize the gar-
goyle is alive. The three human statues are in the 
second row from the east. The statue at the north 
end of the row is of a man dressed in hides who 
just finished a powerful, two-handed swing with 
his warhammer. The second statue from the south 
is of a woman in studded leather armor with an 
empty bow, reaching behind her back for another 
arrow. The last statue in that row shows a small, 
wiry man in leather armor standing on one leg, 
as if dodging something. All the goblin and gnoll 
statues have similar poses, but most of them show 
horrified faces.
Anyone making a DC 14 Intelligence (Investi-
gation) check while studying the statues discovers 
hairline cracks and chips in all of them. In addition, 
several of them have heads that were broken off 
and placed back upon the neck. All the statues were 
once humanoids petrified by the cockatrice before 
being dragged here by the gargoyle. None of them 
would survive the transformation back to flesh.
This room is the home of a gargoyle, but the 
creature does not move until discovered or com-
bat begins with the PCs. Unless the PCs killed the 
cockatrice in Room C16, it is also hiding here. Allow 
a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to see the cock-
atrice as it moves away from them, trying to hide 
behind the statues.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Conceal-
ment, Echoes 4
Tactics: The gargoyle attacks if it is discovered, if the 
cockatrice enters combat, or if a PC turns his back 
on it while within close range. In any of these cir-
cumstances, the gargoyle attempts to gain surprise 
on the closest PC. If none are within range, it ma-
neuvers to attack unarmored opponents first. The 
gargoyle performs a full attack whenever possible. 
If present, the cockatrice avoids the PCs and does 
not attack unless it is cornered or they attack the 
gargoyle. If the gargoyle is destroyed, or it has less 
than 10 hit points remaining, the cockatrice flees 
back to Room C16.
Treasure: Except for the murals, which cannot be 
removed, the room is empty.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add an additional damage die to each of the 
gargoyle’s attacks. To decrease the challenge, the 

217
217
gargoyle begins the encounter wounded 
(-40 hit points).
C20-C21 . PATH OF 
DESTRUCTION
The demon imprisoned in room C21 has 
many names. His true name is still unknown, 
and this is perhaps the main reason he has 
been so consistently elusive. He is most often 
referred to as Falortuligo, which translates 
into Common as “the clever ash,” or “Ash, the 
Trickster.” In addition to his ability to escape impris-
onment of any kind, Ash is renowned for being a 
malicious tormentor.
That reputation was the primary reason he earned 
a special place in this prison. His cell was designed 
with no exit and its entrance is a specially constructed 
gateway, set inside two archways to create a one-way 
portal into the cell. The cell was flooded with water 
and eight massive cold iron chains were designed to 
seek and clamp down on any heat source entering 
the place. When the chains found purchase on the 
demon that was transported here, the runes on the 
walls of the cell activated and froze everything solid.
Ash was discovered by a group of angels and 
captured. He was then transported to the cell’s entry 
chamber after construction was completed (room 
C110). The demon offered little resistance until the 
last moment, when he pushed a solar angel named 
Amarantiel into the prison portal. Right before he 
was forced inside himself, Amarantiel (which means 
“Unfading Vigilance” in the Celestial tongue) knew 
there would be no escape from the cell. He accepted 
his imprisonment, fighting to subdue Ash in order 
to hasten the freezing process. Though unable to 
prevent one chain from attaching itself to his body, 
Amarantiel directed the other seven chains to Ash. 
The magical walls then froze them both in solid ice 
for millennia.
If Amarantiel thought his unjust interment would 
be spent in quiet contemplation, he was quickly 
corrected by Ash. From the first hour of their con-
finement, Falortuligo initiated a telepathic dialog 
with Amarantiel. Over the centuries, Ash embedded 
thoughts and voices into Amarantiel’s mind, convinc-
ing him that the angel had been falsely imprisoned. 
During the last hundred years of their imprisonment, 
the demon twisted his soothing words until Amaran-
tiel believed Ash was another solar angel.
The final key to unlocking Ash’s prison came when 
the wizard Arum arrived. A decade or so ago, Arum 
built a laboratory (in room C20) and Ash took the 
opportunity to speak telepathically with the wizard. 
Arum believed Ash was a falsely imprisoned angel, 
caught when the demon Falortuligo was placed in his 
cell within the prison complex. The demon told Arum 
it was impossible for him to gain freedom with-
out also setting the demon free. Arum was warned 
against telling anyone they had spoken, to prevent 
the possibility of someone freeing the angel, because 
it would also release the demon. Ash’s steadfast re-
fusal of all offers of assistance, lest the demon be set 
free, convinced Arum that the voice in his head was 
that of the angel Amarantiel.
Posing as Amarantiel, Ash asked nothing of the wiz-
ard, but occasionally conversed with Arum during his 
studies. These conversations became more frequent 
as Arum asked “Ash” for advice on magical theories 
and practices while working in his lab. It was during 
one such discussion about the creation of magical 
weaponry that Ash set in motion a plan that would 
lead to his inevitable release.
Arum complained about spending too much time 
maintaining his forge to generate sufficient heat, 
and that his research was suffering as a result. Ash 
suggested placing wards on the front of the forge to 
reflect the heat back into the walls. A higher level of 
heat would then be maintained. Not coincidentally, 
this would also focus a great amount of heat on the 
stone wall surrounding the prison. Arum, however, 
did not know how close he was to Ash‘s icy prison cell. 

218
218
It was this mixture of intense cold from the prison 
and constant heat from the forge that eventually 
cracked the wall separating Rooms C20 and C21 and 
melted the ice to water, which boiled away into the 
forge. Once the wall was weakened, Falortuligo and 
Amarantiel broke free.
When they broke through the wall of the prison, 
the members of the Order of Merunda confronted 
them. At first, Amarantiel believed Ash was another 
angel, and he did not understand why the Paladins of 
Merunda fought him. For millennia, the demon de-
ceived Amarantiel, who now believed Ash was his kin.
While the brave followers of Merunda fought the 
demon, Arum used several illusions to trick Amaran-
tiel into activating his true sight. It was then that the 
veil was lifted from the angel’s eyes and he under-
stood the nature of Ash’s treachery. The Paladins of 
Merunda gave their lives to allow Amarantiel to see 
through the demon’s lies. Their sacrifice allowed the 
angel to regain his senses and slay the demon.
The events leading up to the final confrontation 
between the demon and Amarantiel is recorded in 
Arum’s account of the battle in Room C64.
This Section has no random encounters.
C20 . ARUM'S FORMER LABORATORY
Piles of rubble and cracked stone blocks along the 
walls take up most of the floor of this chamber. 
Inside the room, an immense mound of debris is 
splayed out upon the ground in front of a gaping 
hole in the eastern wall. The rest of the chamber 
is a jumble of crushed timber and broken glass 
strewn about the larger pieces of stone. The west 
wall is scorched, especially around the entrance to 
the room where an overturned forge lays cold and 
broken against the wall.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is the former laboratory and 
living quarters of the wizard Arum. Judging by the 
ground and dispersal pattern of the explosion, 
the hole in the eastern wall is where the forge 
was located before the wall broke. There is a faint 
residue of abjuration magic coming from the 
crushed forge. If PCs examine the forge closer, they 
can attempt a DC 23 Intelligence (Arcana) check to 
decipher the magical runes written inside as wards 
that reflect the heat and energy of the forge back 
into itself.
PCs succeeding at DC 19 Wisdom (Perception) 
checks find several books wedged under the mass 
of stones and boulders. It is clear the books are 
damaged, but they may be of some use, if the 
PCs can find a way to move the massive blocks to 
retrieve them. Most of the blocks of stone in the 
room weigh more than 500 lbs. each, and many 
smaller boulders must be removed before the larg-
er ones can be pushed aside. Anyone attempting 
to clear the rubble must make three separate DC 
17 Strength checks. For each Strength check made, 
one book can be recovered. No more than one 
Strength check can be made every 15 minutes. PCs 
failing to rest after each check suffer cumulative 
points of Exhaustion every half hour.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There is no treasure here unless the PCs 
remove at least three of the undamaged books from 
under the stones. Anyone proficient with Intelli-
gence (Arcana) gains a permanent +2 with the skill 
after spending one month reading the fragments 
of these three books. No further advantages are 
gained for reading more books, but a total of seven 
can be recovered.
Scaling: N/A
C21 . BROKEN PRISON OF FALORTULIGO
This enormous, one hundred ft. tall room is 
noticeably colder than other rooms in the area. 
Four massive chains hang like pillars from the 
ceiling at even intervals in the center of the 
chamber. Coiled upon the ground amid the last 
few links hanging from the ceiling are four more 
impossibly huge chains. The shackles at the end of 
each chain are twisted and warped, as if something 
of immense strength broke its way free. The rest 
of the vast room is surprisingly empty, save for 
the large blue runes encircling the chamber and 
an ornate archway on the north wall. The runes 
emit a faint, steady, and oscillating glow, as if 
imitating the breathing patterns of an enormous 
sleeping beast.
Initial Attitude: Friendly

219
219
Encounter: PCs succeeding at a DC 17 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check realize the chains have prop-
erties of cold iron and adamantine. The PCs who 
make such checks also know it should not be 
possible to combine those two metals, since one is 
forged at low temperature and the other at ex-
tremely high temperatures.
The ornate archway on the north wall has intri-
cate designs surrounding a curtain-like interior. 
The surface of the archway is solid, but has a fluid 
sensation to it. There is no way to pass through the 
archway from this side.
A few minutes after the PCs enter the room, 
Zrino (a lantern archon) arrives through the arch-
way from Room C110. PCs succeeding at a DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check see the creature pass 
through the magical entrance. The archon gives 
the PCs information regarding the prison and its 
current state , as well as providing background 
information about this room (including what little it 
knows about its former occupants).
Zrino’s primary task is to inform the PCs that a 
special key (in Room C105) lends access to anoth-
er door in the dungeon. The archon describes the 
key and indicates it lies to the southeast, but to get 
there, the PCs need to deal with danger along the 
way. The PCs also need the Mark of the Righteous, 
for only those who are blessed with this mark can 
open the door leading into the room where the 
key lies. The archon is able and willing to give the 
mark to those who want it, except for evil-aligned 
characters.
The Mark of the Righteous endows a permanent 
+1 bonus on all saving throws for good characters. 
Neutral characters are unaffected by its effect. If a 
character with the mark ever becomes evil, he loses 
the bonus and suffers a -2 luck penalty on all saving 
throws for as long as they remain evil or until the 
mark dissipates. The archon Zrino gives the mark 
by shining a light on the palm of any non-evil char-
acter wishing to receive it. Close examination of 
a marked hand shows a faintly glowing sigil upon 
the palm. A DC 25 Intelligence (Religion) check 
reveals this sigil as an ancient symbol denoting 
righteousness or proven goodness. The mark lasts 
for 1d3+1 months, after which time it disappears 
from the character’s palm entirely. The Mark of the 
Righteous also grants the bearer the ability to read 
and understand Celestial, but not speak it.
If the PCs ask for aid, the archon replies in a 
musical voice, “I can give you light for your eyes 
and illumination for your mind, but our paths do 
not cross.” Zrino casts continual flame (up to twice 
per PC) on any item the PCs want enchanted. Aside 
from the information regarding the prison and the 
special key, he knows little about the inhabitants 
of the region or the current state of affairs in any 
region other than C and G.
If questioned about Arum, Zrino simply says, 
“The wizard is long gone.” Zrino is one of the 
few inhabitants of the region who knows this. If 
asked about a cure for petrification, the archon 
states, “Gahrr’k has what you seek, but does not 
help others.”
Encounter Condition: [Fear 15], Fearless, Hallowed 3, 
Positive Energy
Tactics: If anyone attacks Zrino, he activates Aura 
of Menace and then flies out of range. If the PCs 
pursue, he attacks with a scorching ray each round 
after the first. Since Zrino cannot be fully killed 
(returning in one month‘s time due to the magic of 
the dungeon), he fights to the death.
In the event the PCs halt their attack, a DC 20 
Charisma (Persuasion) check convinces the archon 
to cease fighting as well. Evil PCs receive Disadvan-
tage to that check.
Treasure: PCs searching the room for at least 1 hour 
are allowed a DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check to 
find a single loose stone in the floor. The stone is 
protected by a glyph of warding (Explosive Runes) 
and a lock that requires a DC 27 Dexterity (Thieves’ 
Tools) check. If opened, the stone can be lifted up. 
Under the tile is a long strongbox, large enough to 
store a longsword. The strongbox has another glyph 
of warding (Explosive Runes) on it and requires a DC 
27 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to open it. Both 
the tiles and the box are indestructible. Inside the 
box is a magical +3 longsword.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two lantern archons. To decrease the challenge, 
remove the Fearless Condition.

C22-C28 . NEUTRAL ZONE .
Originally, the section comprising Rooms C22-C28 
was a processing station for the smaller prison cells 
to the east and west. When an enormous earthquake 
tore a jagged chasm into the foundation of the dun-
geon prison hundreds of years ago, this region was 
all but abandoned.
For the last ten years, the rooms in this section 
were claimed by different inhabitants, including gob-
lins (from Region B) and gnolls from the Gnashing 
Fang Tribe (Rooms C29-C42). Before then, it was 
patrolled and monitored by the Paladins of Merun-
da, though they lived elsewhere in the region. To-
day, however, the section is primarily a buffer zone 
between the goblin and gnoll factions.
The rooms in this area are spattered with long-
dried blood and gore, showing signs of many battles. 
Though the halls are much cleaner than the rooms, 
most doors have crude markings upon them.

2d8+8 goblins from Region B and four gnolls from the Gnashing Fang Tribe are engaged in 
combat. The sound of battle is abrupt and loud enough to wake sleeping PCs. Another 2d6 gnolls 
arrive to support the battle 1d4 rounds after the PCs are made aware of it. The goblins sound a 
retreat if the PCs join the fight. The gnolls attack the PCs, regardless of their actions or intent. If 
the PCs do not interfere, the goblins lose half their forces and retreat, while the gnolls suffer 1d3 
casualties and carry off all dead gnolls and goblins back to their territory.

The PCs stumble upon a trap. Two sword blades strike from each side of the room when a PC steps 
on a 10-ft. square pressure plate. The blades are 3 ft. long and 4 ft. from the ground. They alternate 
directions after each attack, automatically resetting 1 round later.
Double Blade Trap. Detect: DC 15 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 16 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools); 
Characters in a 10-ft. square area DC 15 Dexterity save or take 1d6+8 piercing damage each.
19
The PCs stumble upon a trap. An audible alarm goes off, followed by confusion, affecting everyone 
within a 15-ft radius. The alarm can be heard by everyone within 120 ft. Immediately roll for a second 
encounter, ignoring results of 17, 18, and 19.
Confusion Trap. Detect: DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana); Disable: DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters 
in a 10-ft. square area DC 16 Wisdom save or suffer from confusion.

Whether these marks are warnings, territorial 
boundaries, or something else does not seem to mat-
ter, as they have been crossed out and written over 
countless times. These marks extend to some of the 
walls in the area, but are primarily focused upon the 
doors and archways.
C22 . GREASE TRAP
There are two words written on the door. One is a 
small Goblin marking and the other is a large rune 
written in Gnoll. Both say “TRAP.”
The walls of this room are black, but the floor is 
covered in a greasy residue that has an unpleasant 
smell. There is a small, black, unmoving shape lying 
near the opposite corner of the chamber. The dark 
color of the walls and floor makes it difficult to pick 
out any other features in the room.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: After the door is opened, the trap trig-
gers. There is a 1d6-round delay, before burning 
hands is cast from the corner nearest the door, 
directly towards the floor. Anyone standing in the 
doorway is hit and must succeed at a DC 14 Dex-
terity save for half damage or suffer 3d6 fire dam-
age. In addition, the trap simultaneously lights the 
grease on fire, causing 1d6 points of fire damage 
per round to anyone caught inside the room. The 
grease fire burns itself out in 10 rounds and the 
trap resets itself after another 10 rounds.
Burning Hands and Grease Trap. Detect: DC 19 
Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 17 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools)
Anyone searching the room, before or after it is 
set on fire, must make a DC 10 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check to notice that the walls are heavily caked 
soot. PCs succeeding at a DC 13 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check also find charred bits of bone and metal 
about the floor.
Encounter Condition: [Smoke]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add lightning bolt to the trap, 1d10 rounds into the 
fire. To decrease the challenge, remove the grease.
C23 . KILLER TRAP
The stench of decaying flesh lingers here. The 
nauseating odor is almost certainly caused by the 
rotting gnoll and goblin corpses lying upon the 
floor. They appear to have no wounds on them, but 
the look of terror on their faces is a testament to 
the violent nature of their deaths.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A phantasmal killer trap is set in this room 
that affects the first person entering it. Anyone wit-
nessing the spell sees only a vague shadowy shape. 
This trap resets itself one minute after being trig-
gered, but is only sprung again when PCs re-enter 
the room. PCs already in the room do not trigger 
the spell again.
Phantasmal Killer Trap. Detect: DC 25 Intelli-
gence (Arcana); Disable: DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Characters entering room must succeed on a DC 16 
Wisdom save or suffer from phantasmal killer.
Encounter Condition: [Smoke]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs searching the bodies find various per-
sonal effects.
The gnoll has four knucklebones used for gaming in 
a belt pouch, but one has slightly different mark-
ings. Anyone finding the bones can make DC 15 
Intelligence (Arcana) check to identify the odd bone 
as an archaic (but functional) thunderstone (thrown 
against a hard surface it casts thunderwave at 3rd 
level. Destroyed upon use). Amidst the remains of 
the two goblins the PCs find a short sword, a rusted 
dagger, and 1d4 cp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a burning hands to the phantasmal killer trap. To 
decrease the challenge, replace the phantasmal killer 
trap with a magic missile trap.

C24 . DEAD GHOUL ROOM
This door seems normal at first, but it’s locking 
mechanism is partially melted. The hinges of the 
door seem intact, if a bit rusted. Were it not for the 
mangled lock, this door would not be worth noting.
There is a desiccated corpse in the middle of the 
room. It is so skeletal and unnatural that it must 
be an undead creature. It was leaning against 
the door, as if trying to claw its way out, but it 
is no longer moving. The only thing remarkable 
about the corpse is the fascinating silver necklace 
around its neck.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These are the remains of a ghoul trapped 
here by the wizard Arum. It is still alive, although 
the necklace is constantly draining its strength. 
Thus, the ghoul remains helpless even if the 
necklace is removed, as it has been trapped here 
for years.
Encounter Condition: Haunted, Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The necklace is a simple silver medallion 
with the word “sloth” written in Elven. It is cursed 
and affects any creature with a Strength score that 
wears it. Every day it’s worn, the necklace deals 1d4 
points of Strength damage (at midnight). If this 
reduces the character to 0 Strength, the character 
dies. The strength loss is permanent for as long 
as the necklace is worn, and it cannot be removed 
by any means save remove curse. A restoration spell 
restores all lost Strength provided the necklace has 
been removed. Without the aid of magic, Strength 
lost this way returns at a rate of 1 per day once the 
item has been removed from its victim.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have the necklace deal 1d6 points of Strength 
damage. To decrease the challenge, allow the victim 
to attempt a DC 18 Charisma saving throw each 
morning, removing the necklace on a success.
C25 . OPEN HALLWAY
The hallway opens into a small chamber before 
continuing to the east. There is a dark red stain 
smeared on the floor, as if something were dragged 
down the eastern corridor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The red stain is a trail of smeared blood 
leading to Room C28.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 2

C26 . SMALL CLOSET
The door to this small room squeaks open. 
Inside is a goblin. The creature is dressed in dirty 
clothes and sobs.
Initial Attitude: Neutral
Encounter: The goblin’s name is Ratul, which means 
“stupid weakling.” He was a scout for the Goblin 
King (Room B5), but never provided satisfactory 
information. In truth, Ratul is an exceptional scout. 
But he’s timid and less evil than his kin and there-
fore unwilling to help the Goblin King in his quests.
Ratul continually pulls up a glorified rag that skirts 
his waist. He is covered in cuts and scars consistent 
with the lashes of a whip. Ratul is too shocked to 
speak at first, but he’s ultimately relieved to meet 
someone who isn’t a gnoll or goblin.
If the PCs question him, Ratul pleads for mercy, 
offering his services as guide and scout. Anyone 
who makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check sens-
es Ratul’s sincerity. If the PCs threaten him, Ratul 
becomes afraid and unresponsive once more. If the 
PCs attack, he offers no defense. Ratul is familiar 
with the layout of Rooms C19-C31 and will not 
willingly travel west into Region B, east past Room 
C29, or into Room C32. Unless the PCs succeed at 
a DC 25 Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Per-
suasion) check, nothing convinces him to travel 
to those rooms. If the PCs treat him as a captive, 
or force him to go where he doesn’t want, Ratul 
escapes the first chance he gets.

223
223
If the PCs talk to him, Ratul gives out any 
information he has about the area. He describes a 
great “army of dogmen” to the east, and their war 
with the Goblin King to the west. He also knows 
the “dog king,” named Gahrr’k, has “a small jar 
of grease that makes statues come to life.” Ratul 
witnessed Gahrr’k using the stone salve on one of 
his lieutenants in Room C19, but he never saw the 
cockatrice or gargoyle. Finally, Ratul knows that the 
gnolls and goblin armies avoid this area because of 
the ghouls in Rooms C27 and C28. He chose this 
region as a hiding place because he does not be-
lieve anyone else knows the ghouls were destroyed.
If Ratul joins the PCs, he refuses to assist in 
combat. In fact, the person who is most kind to 
Ratul suffers a -2 AC penalty in any combat situ-
ation, as the goblin clings to that character’s leg 
while in battle. Ratul, however, remains true to his 
word as long as the PCs do not betray him or leave 
him unprotected.

C27 . GHASTLY MURAL
Aggravation emanates from crude drawings on 
the walls here. The images are barely recognizable, 
as the paint used to draw them has faded over 
time. In the southeastern wall of the chamber 
is a tiny structure built from gnawed bones. The 
roof of this miniature house is incomplete, but is 
otherwise surprisingly detailed. Along the eastern 
wall, nine white carved figurines are lined up next 
to the house.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Anyone studying the paintings upon the 
wall is eventually able to discern terrible pictures 
of horrifying acts of violence. Each PC studying 
the murals imagines they see something differ-
ent. The pictures are not magical, but made to 
inspire the most dreadful imaginings of those who 
behold them.
PCs searching the wall behind the bone figurines are 
allowed DC 24 Wisdom (Perception) checks to find 
a 5-ft.-tall secret door leading to Room C28. The 
cramped, cobweb-filled corridor should unnerve 
all but the most seasoned adventurers. Medium 
or larger PCs must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving 
throw or become shaken while inside the passage-
way. Anyone failing the initial save must make 
another DC 20 Wisdom saving throw to prevent 
becoming frightened when they find the secret 
door on the other end of the corridor wedged shut 
(see room C28 for further details).
Anyone succeeding at a DC 15 Intelligence 
(Nature) or a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check can 
identify the bones as those consistent with human-
oid creatures. The corpses are those of three gnolls 
and a human, but the latter has dry and sickly flesh 
mashed almost beyond recognition.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions 4, Haunted
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A PC succeeding at a DC 15 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) check determines the miniature house 
or bone figurines hold no value.
Scaling: N/A
C28 . GHAST TOMB
A pile of crushed rocks is piled in the southeast 
corner of this chamber, blocking the hidden panel 
behind and making it impossible for anyone to enter 
this room via the secret corridor beyond. PCs clearing 
the debris are allowed a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to notice the secret wall panel, which opens 
into the narrow corridor beyond (see Room C27).
A cloud of stench lingers close by. The trail of blood 
leading from the corridor to the door continues 
into the chamber, past the half-opened doorway. 
The room seems empty except for a pile of crushed 
stone boulders in the southeast amid the remains 
of several creatures lying upon the floor in the 
northwest corner.
Entering the room disturbs a cloud of flies hovering 
above the corpses. A closer look inside reveals the 
former occupants were smashed into a mealy pulp. 
The stench obviously emanates from the corpses.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Anyone succeeding at a DC 13 Wisdom 
(Medicine) check determines there are at least three 
gnoll corpses in the pile of bones in addition to the 
remains of the ghast. The gnolls have been dead 

224
224
less than a month, and were torn apart before be-
ing left to rot. The gnoll corpses seem to have been 
purposely dismantled to prevent reanimation.
Gahrr’k, the gnoll chieftain (see Gnashing Fang Tribe 
and room C37), destroyed the ghast a few weeks 
ago, but no one other than the chieftain and Ratul 
knows that. Gahrr’k plans to use this room, but is 
airing it out until it’s hospitable.

C29-C42 . GNASHING FANG TRIBAL GROUNDS .
Nine years ago, a hunting party from the Howling 
Fang Tribe stumbled upon the entrance to the prison. 
The tribal Chieftain, Hag-grt, decided the tribe need-
ed an additional lair and sent one-third of his tribe 
into the dungeon to pave the way for the rest of his 
people. Hag-grt, however, never intended to enter 
the underground prison.
The Howling Fang Tribe was now too large to 
control, and Hag-grt too old to fight off younger and 
stronger gnoll challengers. Wise as he was, he sent 
the toughest gnolls into the dungeon and remained 
with a smaller tribe; one he could control without 
competition.
So it was, that a band of 85 gnolls entered the dun-
geon. They had great success at first, scaring off or 
killing many humanoid races and fiendish beasts sur-
rounding the entrance. But over time, they 
found the dungeon’s massive, sprawling 
tunnels too difficult to navigate and 
soon became lost. Discord broke out 
among the gnolls and a demand for 
leadership reared its head. Two vile 
gnoll brothers, Gahrr’k and Yie-ar’k, 
barked challenges, each claiming 
leadership of the group.
After some discussion, Gahrr’k 
agreed to support his brother, Yie-
ar’k. But the gnolls did not all agree 
that he should lead, and one by one, 
the gnolls stepped forth to contest 
his leadership. After six challeng-
ers, a young hot-headed gnoll 
named Attuk’k stepped forward 
and, in a ferocious battle, crippled 
Yier-ar’k. Although Attuk’k was de-
feated, Gahrr’k stepped forward and 
decapitated both of them, assuring 
his place as leader of the tribe. After that, no one 
challenged Gahrr’k’s right to lead.
Gahrr’k (Room C37) took the remaining gnolls 
and formed what became the Gnashing Fang Tribe. 
Gahrr’k then led his tribe further into the dungeon 
prison. By the time the gnolls realized that he never 
intended to leave the vast underground complex, they 
had little choice but to follow their chieftain.
Sometime after 
entering the 

225
225
dungeon, Gahrr’k met the Goblin King, Argliss. 
Though unafraid of the goblin, he worked out an 
immediate agreement with Argliss rather than fight 
(especially without a lair of their own yet). Gahrr’k dis-
covered Argliss was fearful of the wizard Arum (to the 
east), and volunteered to kill the wizard in exchange 
for a vague alliance between their two tribes. Thinking 
either the wizard or the gnolls would be destroyed 
by such an alliance, the Goblin King agreed, send-
ing along 20 of his own warriors to assist. Gahrr’k 
left the Goblin King’s domain and paused in Room 
C29 to inspect his new forces. He charged forward to 
fight the wizard, but soon realized Arum had left the 
region long ago.
Gahrr’k then took 14 goblins as slaves and killed 
the other six as an example. In the next few months, 
Gahrr’k sent several reports to the Goblin King. These 
reports described deadly battles fought against the 
wizard Arum, but in truth Gahrr’k’s tribe never found 
the wizard.

Nurganar (Room C9) searches for treasure. When encountered, he asks for a tribute of 100 gp from 
each PC. If the PCs pay up, Nurganar talks with them. Since he travels everywhere, he knows about 
the region.
As the months went by, the gnoll chieftain request-
ed more goblin reinforcements, and each time the 
Goblin King sent to their deaths. Gahrr’k, however, 
grew careless with the arrangement and a goblin 
eventually escaped slavery, and returned to tell his 
king of the gnolls’ treachery. The goblins and gnolls 
then waged war against one another, and both fac-
tions lost a great number of warriors. Now, the two 
groups have troubles of their own and avoid each 
other almost entirely. 

226
226
The first encounter between the PCs and the 
Gnashing Fang Tribe might not be a surprise meet-
ing at least not for the gnolls. They guard the eastern 
access (Room C38) and regularly patrol the various 
western entrances. Despite their chaotic nature, dis-
cipline is high among the gnoll warriors. With so few 
remaining their very survival depends on it.
The gnolls do not attack unless the PCs strike first. 
They parley with PCs and will listen to offers of diplo-
macy or trade. If the PCs convince the gnolls that they 
mean them no harm, they are escorted directly to 
Gahrr’k (Room C37). The chieftain is willing to parley 
with non-hostile PCs and cut a deal with them (see 
Room C37).
If the PCs attack any gnoll before being allowed 
passage, the remaining gnolls overwhelm the PCs 
and take them prisoner. If combat occurs, the gnolls 
capture the PCs first, using non-lethal damage. If 
the PCs killed at least one gnoll (and the gnolls know 
about it), every further encounter with the Gnashing 
Fang Tribe is hostile. If the PCs gain an upper hand 
and corner Gahrr’k, he challenges a single PC to an 
honorable duel. If he wins, he offers amnesty to any 
other PC who swears fealty to him.
C29 . WESTERN GNOLL MUSTERING 
ROOM
This large room has a door in each corner and one 
set into the eastern wall. The floor suggests a high 
traffic volume, with several scuffed paths worn 
out between each door. The walls are completely 
covered in filth, as if painted in blood.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Regular traffic from the gnoll encamp-
ment moves through here. A group of gnolls on 
patrol pass through the room once every two to 
three hours. A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check 
will determine that the walls have been spattered 
with blood repeatedly. The blood is thicker near the 
doors, but is fairly even throughout the room. The 
blood seems to be nothing more than a warning 
to enemies.
Though this room serves as a means of passage, 
the gnolls from Rooms C33 and C35 remain alert. 
When the PCs are in this chamber, allow the gnolls 
a Wisdom (Perception) check (Disadvantage for 
distance) to notice their presence. Once they notice 
the PCs, the gnolls from Room C33 enter this room 
using the eastern door 1d4+1 rounds later. 1d3 
rounds after they arrive, more gnolls from Room 
C34 come through the southeastern entrance. 
These warriors are well trained. However, like all 
members of their tribe, they are willing to parley 
with PCs that come in peace.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If a fight breaks out, the gnolls take the PCs 
prisoner rather than fighting to the death. If this is 
not possible, they fight ferociously, sending gnolls 
one at a time for reinforcements if the battle goes 
poorly for them.
If the PCs keep quiet and are not discovered, 
roll for a random encounter after 30 minutes in 
this room.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
allow the gnolls in Rooms C33 and C35 Percep-
tion checks without Disadvantage. To decrease the 
challenge, do not allow them to make a percep-
tion check.
C30 . WEAPONS STORAGE
Nothing can stop the rusted hinges from squeaking 
when the door is pushed open. The sound alerts the 
gnoll guards in Rooms C33 and C35 if they succeed 
at DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks. If they hear 
the distinctive sound, the gnolls from Room C33 will 
enter Room C29 using the eastern door 1d4+1 rounds 
later. More gnolls from Room C35 come through the 
southeastern door 1d3 rounds after the warriors from 
Room C33. These warriors are prepared for anything 
and remain in Room C29 to block the only available 
exit from this storage area.
The door to this room squeals loudly when opened. 
The place seems to be an armory or storage area 
holding a range of weaponry. A few of the larger 
weapons are placed in unevenly constructed wall 
mounts, but most are simply piled up on the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This is the Gnashing Fang Tribe’ stockpile 
of unused weapons. Since the members of the tribe 
train exclusively with only a few different types of 
weapons, the items gathered here (gathered from 
the surrounding areas over the years) are seldom 

227
227
used. Many of the weapons are in excellent con-
dition, but after years of abuse and neglect, none 
can be considered masterwork quality anymore. 
The gnolls have no use for these weapons, but 
they do not allow anyone to take any of them 
without permission from their chieftain Gahrr’k 
(Room C37).
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4, [Safe]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: With the exception of warhammers, battle 
axes, great axes, and clubs, nearly any type of stan-
dard melee weapon can be found in this room. 
The weapon sizes range from small to large and 
there is a 25% chance of any particular weapon 
being present (roll once per weapon type).
Scaling: N/A
C31 . HAUNTED ROOM
The floor of this large chamber is scattered with 
piles of crushed stone, bits of broken weapons 
and furniture, as well as rotting wood. Amidst 
the rubbish, the shape of four humanoids can be 
made out. One of these silhouettes looks human, 
but the other three are tall and have canine faces. 
The creatures’ bodies are pale where their flesh is 
exposed, and their gaze is empty.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: About a week ago, a lone wight entered 
Gnashing Fang Tribe territory, killing three gnolls 
on patrol and turning them into mindless servants. 
With the help of its newly created spawn, the crea-
ture took control of the room.
The powerful wight and its three spawn haunt this 
room. The creatures are causing major problems to 
the Gnashing Fang Tribe. Most of its warriors dare 
not face these horrors, fearing that they, like their 
former comrades, might be turned into mindless 
undead servants. Because of this, PCs who destroy 
these undead creatures and tell the gnolls about 
their deed will benefit from Advantage on their 
Charisma (Persuasion) checks while dealing with 
any member of the Gnashing Fang Tribe.
Encounter Condition: Desecration 2 or Unhallowed, 
Distracting Visions
Tactics: The four wights attack anyone entering their 
new domain. These fiends do not wield any weap-
ons in combat, preferring to close into melee as 
soon as possible.
Treasure: The original wight wears a tarnished silver 
chain (worth 10 gp if cleaned) upon which hangs an 
ivory amulet carved to look like the face of a hawk. 
This item is worth only 10 gp, but could be sold to 
historians or sages for 200 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the wight spawn’s damage by 1 die. To 
decrease the challenge, remove two wights.

C32 . WESTERN GNOLL MUSTERING 
ROOM
This large hall contains three mounds of crushed 
rock. This refuse is lined upon the southern wall, 
forming six-ft-high piles. It is obvious by the state 
of disrepair of the ceiling as well as the east and 
south walls that the rubble was once part of the 
walls and ceilings of this room. The door in the 
middle of the north wall is wide open, revealing the 
dark and narrow corridor beyond.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: It is obvious that this room suffered some 
sort of damage, but whether it was caused by a 
minor cave-in or a great battle is difficult to say. 
Though the southern wall, eastern wall, and ceil-
ing are uneven, the stone of these surfaces looks 
identical to that of the other walls and floor, which 
is relatively smooth and worn.
Before the wights took over Room C31, this area 
was used as a mustering place for the gnolls of the 
Gnashing Fang Tribe and, with the exception of the 
regular patrol passing through the chamber, it re-
mained mostly empty the rest of the time. Current-
ly, a cunning gnoll ranger guards the place.
Verk’nek, a respected gnoll ranger and loyal 
lieutenant, took it upon himself to set up a per-
manent vigil in this hall. Fearing the wights in 
Room C31 might come deeper into Gnashing Fang 
territory, Verk’nek hides behind broken stones 
in the southeast corner. He remains hidden and 
silent when patrols of Gnashing Fang warriors pass 
through the hall or if his compatriots escort the 
PCs to Gahrr’k.
If the PCs enter unescorted, Verk’nek remains 
hidden but demands in a clear voice that the PCs 
identify themselves and their business in Gnashing 
Fang territory. Verk’nek’s voice is loud and clear, 
alerting gnolls in Room C31 that succeed at a DC 
16 Wisdom (Perception) check. Four gnolls enter 
the hall 1d3 rounds later, while the other warns the 
gnolls in Room C35, who arrive 1d3 rounds after the 
group from Room C31 arrives.
Unless provoked, Verk’nek does not engage the 
PCs. Like most members of his tribe, he prefers 
diplomacy. Verk’nek’s most immediate concerns are 
the wights. If he knows the PCs destroyed the crea-
tures, his attitude shifts to friendly and he reveals 
himself. Otherwise, he remains hidden and waits 
for his tribemates to join him.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Cover, Hazardous 
Footing 16
Tactics: In battle, Verk’nek remains mostly hidden 
behind rubble, which grants him cover. He shoots 
arrows, targeting the more highly armored PCs 
first, until forced into melee. To reach Verk’nek, the 
PCs must maneuver around the rubble in the east-
ern portion of the southern wall.
Treasure: The large quiver Verk’nek carries holds 40 
arrows and is made of boiled leather and decorated 
with a multitude of tribal designs, each more intri-
cate than the next. Because of its artistic value, it is 
worth five times the value of other items of its kind 
to most people, and up to ten times that amount to 
any gnoll.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give Verk’nek 2 potions of invisibility and +5 damage 
on ranged attacks. To decrease the challenge of this 
encounter, reduce his hit points by 20.
C33 . FIRST GUARDROOM
Both doors to this room are open.
Eight long bunks are lined up on the walls of this 
chamber, taking up most of the southwestern and 
northeastern corners. There is a low wooden table 
with several stools in the middle of the room, as 
well as simple weapon racks near both entrances. 
These racks contain a variety of clubs and axes.
Initial Attitude: Neutral
Encounter: This guardroom once housed eight 
gnolls, but only six gnolls are currently here. 
While off duty, these warriors remain vigilant. 
They pay particular attention to any noise coming 
from Room C29 or Room C32. Like most of their 
tribesmen, these gnolls are content to speak with 
PCs wishing to trade information or goods. If the 
PCs wish to pass through Gnashing Fang tribal 
grounds, the gnolls insist that they speak to their 
chieftain Gahr’r’k (and escort them to Room C37).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If fighting ensues, the gnolls will charge the 
PCs. They target the warriors of the party first and 
flank them whenever they can.

229
229
The gnolls in Room C35 are automatically aware of a 
fight, and join 1d3 rounds later. Allow the sleeping 
gnolls in Room C36 a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) 
check. If they hear trouble, these warriors aid their 
fellow tribesmen in 1d4+2 rounds.
Treasure: In addition to the weapons they carry, each 
of these gnolls have 1d4 gp worth of small, uncut 
semi-precious gemstones and silver coins. Addi-
tionally, one wears a decorative bronze armband. 
Carved upon its surface in simple lines is a mighty 
bear. This trinket is worth upwards of 15 gp. The 
weapons racks near the doors holds two clubs, a 
great club, and three battle axes; all average quality. 
A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Search) check in this 
room also reveals a dagger with a jewel-embedded 
hilt worth 100 gp tucked under a crude mattress of 
a bunk, as well as a pouch containing 41 cp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add two gnolls. To decrease the challenge, remove 
two gnolls.
C34 . SECOND GUARDROOM
This wide room contains the wooden frames of 
twelve bunk beds. A thin layer of dust covers the 
frames and floor of this chamber, suggesting that 
the place has not been used in a while.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room used to house gnolls from the 
Gnashing Fang Tribe, but none have used it in over 
two years.
Encounter Condition: Safe
Tactics: While this room is safe to rest in, the con-
stant traffic of gnolls just outside the doors is 
nerve-racking.
Treasure: A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) 
check spots a silver coin tucked under the leg of 
one of the bunk beds.
Scaling: N/A
C35 . THIRD GUARDROOM
A stone slab dominates the southeast corner of this 
chamber. The slab is cracked in many places and its 
surface is covered with crude but colorful graffiti. 
Several wooden stools have been placed around the 
painted flat stone “table,” and a number of empty 
jars rest upon it. There are a dozen bunk beds lining 
the north and west walls, as well as a simple iron 
rack holding several weapons beside the southern 
door, which is wide open.
Three gnolls sit in a circle in the middle of the 
room: one is holding a handful of bones while the 
others are eagerly looking on. In front of each of 
the canine-faced humanoids, stacked upon the floor 
before them, are piles of copper coins.
Initial Attitude: Neutral
Encounter: Three gnoll warriors are sitting in a 
circle in the middle of the room, playing a game 
of chance. Though their attention is focused on 
their game, they keep their ears open to any noise 
coming from Room C29. They suffer Disadvantage 
to any checks made to notice the PCs.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4
Tactics: These gnolls are more interested in acquir-
ing copper (or silver!) for use in gambling, rather 
than fighting. But, if the PCs pose any threat to 
them, or if they learn that they have harmed any 
member of their tribe, they grab their weapons and 
attack them.
In combat, two gnolls stand in the middle of 
the room, preventing the PCs from reaching their 
companion, whose task it is to alert the warriors 
in Rooms C33 and C36, as well as their chieftain in 
Room C37. This gnoll stays behind his companions 
and barks loudly. He continues to bark until he is 
either forced into melee or reinforcements arrive, at 
which point he joins the fighting.
The gnolls in Room C33 are instantly alerted and 
arrive 1d3 rounds later. Allow the sleeping warriors 
in Room C36 a DC 26 Wisdom (Perception) check 
to notice the ruckus. If they are awakened, these 
gnolls enter this guardroom 1d3 rounds later. 
Gahrr’k (Room C37) will notice the fighting if he (or 
anyone else in his throne room) succeeds at a DC 
18 Wisdom (Perception) check. They then rouse the 
warriors in Room C36 and arrive within 1d3 rounds.

Treasure: There is a total of 151 cp lying upon the 
ground of this chamber. The tokens the gnolls 
are using for their game are six elaborately carved 
bones with several designs printed upon them. 
Though these are mostly useless, a gnoll might pay 
upwards of 5 gp for them.
The stone tablet is used as both a table and canvas 
for painting. The jars lying upon it are empty save 
for a thick layer of dried paint. Most of the images 
represent animals and magical beasts hunted by 
bands of gnolls. They are crude and worthless to all 
but gnolls.
The weapons rack near the southern entrance holds 
a great-axe, two battle-axes, a warhammer, and a 
masterwork great club.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each gnoll the Second Wind Bonus Action (1/
rest: recover 1d10 + 2 hit points). To decrease the 
challenge, remove one gnoll.
C36. Fourth Guardroom
There are four humanoids in this chamber. These 
creatures are tall, with their furry bodies and 
canine-like faces exposed as they slumber upon 
large bunk beds. Though there are more bunks 
here than there are inhabitants, twelve beds in all, 
only nine of these have mattresses and woolen 
blankets upon them. There is a pair of well-polished 
great axes resting upon the wall close to the 
northwestern door.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This guardroom normally houses nine 
gnolls, but some are out on patrol. There are four 
gnoll warriors currently sleeping here. If intrud-
ing PCs rouse them, they rush out of their beds 
and ready for battle. Unlike most other members 
of their tribe, they are prone to attack PCs enter-
ing their private chamber uninvited, but PCs who 
successfully change their initial attitude through the 
use of a Charisma (Persuasion) check might avoid 
any combat.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: In battle, these warriors will fight savagely, 
and flank the more heavily armed and armored foes 
as often as they can manage.
While in combat, these gnolls utter loud barks 
to alert the rest of their tribe. Allow the gnolls in 
Room C35 and the chieftain in Room C37 a DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the ruckus. If 
they do, these gnolls join the fight in 1d3 rounds. 
Similarly, allow the gnolls in Room C33 a DC 18 
Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the commotion. 
These warriors join the battle 1d4+2 rounds after 
they are made aware of it.
Treasure: Each gnoll in this chamber carries 1d4 gp 
worth of gemstones and assorted coins. One of 
them also has a masterwork warhammer, which 
he keeps at the foot of his bed. The two great axes 
lying upon the north wall near the western door are 
sound weapons of ordinary quality.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give each gnoll the Second Wind Bonus Action (1/
rest: recover 1d10 + 2 hit points). To decrease the 
challenge, remove one gnoll.
C37. Gahrr'k's Chamber
A wide black pelt covers a good portion of the floor 
in the middle of this large chamber. A bed and an 
iron chest lie in the northeast corner of the room, 
while a narrow wooden desk takes up most of the 
northwest corner. A stone chair that resembles a 
kingly throne sits upon the floor. ln the middle of 
the northern wall, the flames from several torches 
set amidst this wall burn, bathing the room in a 
warm golden light.
Upon the throne-like chair is a large figure with 
the features of a wild dog, with one ear missing, 
replaced by scar tissue. The fur of the humanoid, 
dark and disheveled, is visible where its burgundy 
clothing and polished scale mail armor do not 
cover it. The fiery eyes of the inhuman face burn 
brightly. Another male humanoid bearing similar 
features stands near the creature on the throne. 
Three other gnoll warriors are standing by the 
southern door, as if awaiting orders.

231
231
Initial Attitude: Neutral
Encounter: Gahrr’k One-Ear, the powerful, savage 
gnoll chieftain of the Gnashing Fang Tribe, lives in 
this room. Gahrr’k is a fierce and proven warrior 
who won the respect of his peers long ago. He rules 
the Gnashing Fang Tribe and his ambitions include 
the invasion of the goblin tribe to the west, for the 
war he waged against the Goblin King caused his 
tribe to suffer terrible losses. Though Gahrr’k real-
izes this is a long-term endeavor, he continues to 
dream of the day when the territory of Argliss’ the 
Goblin King falls under his control.
If members of his tribe escorted the PCs to 
Gahrr’k’s chamber and they offered no resistance 
or threat to his people, the chieftain is eager to talk 
and negotiate with them. Gahrr’k is more than will-
ing to trade information and safe passage through 
the territory controlled by the Gnashing Fang Tribe 
in exchange for weapons and other valuables. He 
is most interested in hearing what the PCs have 
learned about the other regions of the dungeon, 
especially if they have news of Argliss or his lowly 
goblins. If the PCs inform Gahrr’k that they dis-
posed of the goblin king, the chieftain is much 
more willing to help the PCs.
A cunning gnoll, Gahrr’k negotiates with the 
PCs, hoping to gain their assistance in getting rid 
of the hill giant family to the east, as well as the 
goblins to the west (should they still remain). If 
the PCs show no interest in any of these endeav-
ors but are respectful of Gahrr’k and his people, 
the chieftain will agree to grant them safe passage 
through his domain. If the PCs are interested in 
slaughtering the goblins or routing out the giants, 
Gahrr’k offers all the gold he possesses (kept in his 
chest) in exchange for the head of the three giants 
or the goblin king. The gnolls do not actively help 
the PCs in such a mission, but they offer them aid 
with menial tasks and a safe haven.
When questioned on the wizard Arum, Gahrr’k 
reveals he has never seen him and suspects he is ei-
ther dead or long ago left the dungeon. He has ex-
plored most of the wizard’s domain, and even used 
portions of it in the past to house the warriors of 
his tribe. Though he abandoned any claims he had 
on the wizards territory long ago (because of the 
many traps found therein, but also because of the 
diminished number of warriors under his control), 
Gahrr’k occasionally sends scouts to investigate. As 
far as he knows, no one lives there.
If asked about the goblin king, Gahrr’k explains 
that the goblins have long been a thorn in his 
side, but that in recent years the fighting between 
Argliss’ people and the Gnashing Fang Tribe almost 
ceased mainly because Gahrr’k does not have the 
manpower to wage a constant war against the 
little vermin.
If the PCs barter with Gahrr’k, he offers any of 
the weapons stored in Room C30 in exchange for 
axes, clubs, hammers, bows and arrows, crossbows 
and bolts, ropes, or oil flasks. Gahrr’k One-Ear has 
a small jar of stone 
salve with 
two appli-
cations left, 
enough to 
restore two 
people 
back to 
flesh. 
He is willing 
to trade it for weap-
ons or various other goods 
valued at 8,000 gp or more. Gold 
coins alone cannot account for more than half of 
this deal, however, as coins are nearly worthless 
down here. The chieftain has little else to offer, but 
listens to any offers of diplomacy the PCs make.
If the PCs barge into his chamber unescorted, 
or if the chieftain learns they killed members of 
his tribe, he picks up his enchanted great club and 
attacks. His lieutenant and three bodyguards react 
instantly.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: In combat, Gahrr’k lets his men handle the 
PCs while he drinks a draught of his potion of speed. 
The following round, he attacks heavily armored 
PCs first. Meanwhile, the bodyguards engage 
the PCs in melee and the lieutenant attacks the 
spellcasters.
These warriors bark loudly in combat, and their 
cries alarm the gnolls in Room C33 if they make a 
DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, as well as those 
in Rooms C33 and C36 if they succeed at a DC 20 
Wisdom (Perception) check. These warriors come 
to aid their chieftain 1d4+2 rounds after they have 
been made aware of the ruckus.
Treasure: In addition to the weapons they carry, the 
three gnolls have 1d4 gp worth of small jewels and 

232
232
coins. The pelts upon the chieftain’s bed are in good 
condition and could be sold for upwards of 30 gp. 
Gahrr’k carries a variety of magical items and a 
small silvery key hangs from a golden chain (worth 
35 gp) at his neck. This key unlocks the chest at the 
foot of the bed.
Gahrr’k’s chest is made of iron. It is locked and 
requires a DC 22 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check 
or the chieftain’s key to unlock. Inside, there is a 
total of 754 gp and 1,312 sp. On top of the coins 
there is a green velvet pouch containing three 
small diamonds (each worth 750 gp), a tarnished 
silvered dagger, and an empty ivory scroll case. 
When closed, this scroll case can be submerged in 
water without risk of damaging any parchment held 
inside. This object is worth 20 times the value of 
similar items of its kind.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a fiendish darkmantle (Region A), that Gahrr’k 
befriended with wild empathy. To decrease the 
challenge, remove two gnolls or the lieutenant from 
the encounter.
C38 . CELLBLOCK
The door on the eastern wall is locked and requires 
the jailer’s key (see below) or a successful DC 22 
Dexterity check. It can be unlocked from either side, 
but PCs coming from the east automatically alert the 
inhabitants.
This wide hallway contains four wooden doors with 
small windows and iron bars upon both the north 
and south walls. These eight doors open into what 
appears to be eight small cells, but only one of 
them is closed. There are two double doors made of 
wood and reinforced with iron plates in the center 
of the north wall. Similar doors appear in the 
middle of the south wall.
In the center of the room is a long table made 
out of wood with six comfortable-looking wooden 
chairs set around it. There are four gnolls in this 
room. Three of them hold great axes and shields 
while a third is armed with an axe and a whip.
Initial Attitude: Neutral
Encounter: Five of the cell doors have no locks and 
there is no obvious way to lock them. The other 
cells have workable locking mechanisms, but only 
the door to the southeastern cell is closed and 
locked. Inside this cell is the recently expired body 
of a goblin. The creature’s skin is taut and scarred 
with countless whip marks. It probably died from 
both malnutrition and abuse.
Ramk’mva, the gnoll jailer, and three gnolls are 
in charge of securing the prison, as well as pro-
tecting the borders of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. 
Ramk’mva is an old and cunning gnoll who earned 
the trust of his chieftain long ago. He is content 
with his position within the tribe and happy to 
oversee the prisons, especially since so little needs 
to be done.
To help control their territory, the gnolls keep 
the eastern door locked at all times. Ramk’mva 
holds the key, but does not let anyone through, 
unless Gahrr’k orders it.
If the PCs enter this room from the east, they 
must first pick the lock of the door. The gnolls 
stand ready to face them in battle when they enter, 
but Ramk‘mva is willing to talk. He informs them 
that this marks the boundary of the Gnashing Fang 
tribal grounds and has his warriors escort the PCs 
to Gahrr’k (in Room C37). If the PCs refuse, but 
agree not to disturb the tribe, Ramk’mva is happy 
to bid them goodbye. If the PCs threaten or attack 
the gnolls, combat ensues.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If combat is inevitable, Ramk’mva lets the 
three warriors handle the PCs while he makes his 
way to Rooms C36, C35, and C37 to alert the other 
gnolls of intruders. Though he does not wish to 
fight, if cornered or unable to escape, Ramk’mva 
fights until defeated. In combat, he uses both his 
battle-axe and whip to disarm the PCs every chance 
he gets. Meanwhile, the three warriors engage in 
melee, targeting the strongest first, using gang 
tactics whenever possible.
If fighting breaks out in the cellblock, allow 
the gnolls in Rooms C33, C34, C36, and C37 a DC 
22 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the sound 
of battle. If they do, they come to aid their fellow 
tribesmen 1d4+2 rounds thereafter.
Treasure: The cells hold nothing valuable, but each 
of the warriors in this room carries a pouch with 
1d4 gp worth of small gemstones, silver coins, and 
copper pieces. Ramk’mva the Jailer has a ring of 
keys that unlocks the eastern door as well as each 
of the three cells that still have a working locking 
mechanism upon their doors. One of the keys 

233
233
he carries also unlocks the doors of Rooms C40, 
C41, and C42, as well as the double doors south 
of Room C40.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
double the number of gnoll warriors present and 
give Ramk’mva Sneak Attack (4d6). To decrease the 
challenge, remove three gnolls.
C39 . LIEUTENANT'S QUARTERS
The doors opening into this chamber are unlocked. 
Inside the small room, cast in the heavy shadows, 
are two narrow but comfortable-looking beds. The 
beds are covered with thick animal pelts.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is the quarters of two power-
ful members of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. Verk’nek 
holds the title of lieutenant and guards’ Room C32, 
and Nirk’na is the chieftain’s right-hand man (in 
Room C37). Both are feared by the warriors of the 
tribe and trust Ramk’mva (Room C38) to protect 
their private chamber.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) 
check made in this room uncovers a small wooden 
chest hidden under one of the beds. This chest is 
unlocked and holds 37 sp, a large chunk of golden 
amber (worth 95 gp), and a bronze bracelet large 
enough to cover the entire forearm of a medium 
sized creature (worth 50 gp).
Scaling: N/A
C40 . SECURED AREA
All the doors to this room are locked. Ramk’mva 
(Room C38) possesses the only key. A DC 23 Dexterity 
check is required to unlock any of the doors.
This hallway is cast in total darkness. Upon closer 
examination, the floor here has several scuff marks 
imprinted on the cold stone. The floor, however, is 
covered with a thick blanket of dust, suggesting 
that although there once was heavy traffic in this 
area, this hall has not been entered in years.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room and the locked double doors 
leading into it serve as a safety buffer between the 
cellblock (Room C38) and the jail cells holding dan-
gerous creatures to the south (Rooms C41 and C42).
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
C41 . RUST MONSTER'S PRISON CELL
The doors of this cell are made of heavy oak and 
several wooden beams nailed into the stone wall 
block it. Anyone wishing to enter this room must 
first remove the wooden planks that block the en-
trance. Each of the five beams can be pulled with a 
successful DC 20 Strength check. This action reveals a 
rusted-but-functional iron lock mechanism. A DC 19 
Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check is required to unlock 
the door unless the PCs have acquired its key from 
Room C38. The PC opening this door must succeed 
at a DC 20 Dexterity check. Failing this check results 
in the door falling off its hinges, which are completely 
eaten by rust.
Inside this large, shadowy chamber is an insect-like 
creature with four squat legs, long antennae, and 
a squat body protected by an odd hide. The walls 
of this chamber are made of stone, and, like most 
of the dungeon, seem to have been carved out 
from the sheer bedrock. These walls, however, have 
turned into a deep rust-colored shade, as if every 
speck of metal within them had rusted.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A Large rust monster is locked in this 
room. The creature has been feeding on the tiny 
residues of iron found within the walls of its prison. 
It is maddened and hateful, standing ready to 
charge anyone fool enough to unlock its cell.
While the room itself is not haunted, remaining in it 
for more than 24 hours can have damaging effects. 
Soft, almost imperceptible echoes bounce from the 
walls of the room. As time goes on, these echoes 
become harder and harder to block out, until the 
creature inside begins to think the sounds are part 
of their own mind. Anyone failing a Wisdom save 
(DC 15 + 1 per previous save) suffers 1 point of Wis-
dom damage, which takes twice as long to heal as 

234
234
normal. This save must be repeated every two hours 
beyond the first 24.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 4, Fearless, [Safe]
Tactics: The monster has become mindless as a result 
of being trapped in the cell too long. It attacks the 
closest PC in metal armor and fights ferociously. It 
continues to attack the PC until his armor is beyond 
repair, then targets weapons, before moving on to 
the next PC. While rust monsters themselves do 
not normally act like trapped animals, this one has 
suffered too much from its lengthy imprisonment.
Treasure: Anything of value is now a pile of rust, 
although there is a masterwork cudgel on the floor 
in the corner of the room. Allow the PCs to dig 
through the piles all they like, however.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one rust monster. To decrease the challenge, 
have the rust monster wounded (-30 hit points).
C42 . IMPRISONED OCHRE JELLY
The doors leading into this cell are locked. The key to 
unlock them can be found in Room C38. Otherwise, a 
DC 15 Dexterity check is enough to bypass the lock.
This chamber contains a mass of yellowish 
ooze. The strange entity is oddly shaped and, 
in the darkness, moves slowly. Its slick surface 
undulates, reflecting light against the black of the 
dungeon walls.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: An ochre jelly is trapped in this cell. The 
creature has been imprisoned here for decades, and 
not even the gnolls could say who is responsible for 
imprisoning it here. Its corrosive jelly eats away at 
the stonework, turning it black.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Fear-
less, [Safe]
Tactics: As soon as anyone opens the door, the ochre 
jelly strikes the first target that gets in its way. In 
combat, it grapples and constricts its prey. If a PC 
is stunned, it moves on to the next, so it can escape 
without fear of reprisal. If the PCs leave it a way out, 
it moves into the corridor outside the door. It does 
not fight unless it has to.
Treasure: Any treasure that may have existed 
is slag now.

C43-C59 . THE WIZARD'S DOMAIN
Following the brutal deaths of the knights and pala-
dins of Merunda, and the destruction of his former 
laboratory (see Rooms C20 and C21), the wizard 
Arum established a home for himself in this section 
of the dungeon. The wizard is responsible for the 
accidental liberation of the demon Falortuligo (Room 
C21). Though Arum left long ago, this section is still 
considered his, as few creatures dare venture here 
and most inhabitants assume he is still around.
GMs wishing to complete the saga of Arum can 
place his corpse in one of the rooms where he com-
mitted suicide, somewhere in Region O. Alternatively, 
place a wraith, ghost, lich, or wight somewhere in this 
region to represent his remorse and eternal damna-
tion manifested into evil.

C43 . EMPTY STOREROOM
As the PCs approach this door, allow them each a DC 
19 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear moaning from 
inside the room.
Most of the stone floor of this room is hidden 
under thick wooden crates. Though these crates 
are sturdy, and their wood is mostly undamaged, 
many of them are opened and empty. The walls 
are blackened by age and magic. In the darkness 
of a nearby comer, the spiny silhouette of a beast 
hunkers down behind a crate.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Like many rooms in this section, this 
area was once claimed as part of the Gnashing 
Fang Tribe’s territory. Over the last decade, the tribe 
gradually relinquished control of this section, which 
was once used to store goods. Now millipedes 
and other bugs hunt through the cracks of the 
stonework.
However, before the gnolls left, they mercilessly 
chained a howler to the wall, leaving it for dead. It 
has refused to go quietly and moans pitifully. How-
ever, the room’s magical nature absorbs a great 
deal of the sound and muffles it into white noise.
The room absorbs light and sound and reduces 
their effective range to half.
Encounter Condition: Cover, Echoes 5, Fearless
Tactics: Allow the howler a Wisdom (Perception) 
check to notice the PCs enter the room. If suc-
cessful, it barks loudly, targeting everyone with its 
Mind-Breaking Howl. The howler cannot move, but 
pitifully yanks at its own chain in an attempt to free 
itself. It has no choice, but to fight to the death.
If the PCs try to befriend the creature rather than 
kill it, allow Wisdom (Animal Handling), but since 
the beast is unnatural they suffer Disadvantage.
Treasure: Though most of the crates are empty, 
some contain gear that could be helpful. The PCs 
find three tinder-twigs, a flask of antitoxin, seven 
empty glass vials, a large clay jug, a bullseye lantern, 
three pints of oil, two rusty miner’s picks, 200 ft. of 
hempen rope, and a heavy sledge.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this trap, add 
two vargouille which torment the howler, but turn 
their attention to the PCs when they enter. To 
reduce the challenge, have the howler asleep when 
they arrive.
C44 . MODIFIED CHAMBER
This oddly shaped chamber is vacant. The walls 
here are smooth and undamaged. A closer look at 
the floor reveals that its surface is spotless, save for 
a narrow space, some 10-ft. square, linking the only 
door with the southern wall. The skeletal remains 
of two goblins and one gnoll rest in one corner.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was once a tiny cell, but the 
wizard Arum changed the layout with powerful 
magic after settling in. Though no one knows what 
he intended, those with expertise with stone or ma-
sonry, as well as those accustomed to the geogra-
phy of the dungeon, can tell that something is not 
quite right with the walls of this room.
Aside from the 10-ft.-wide portion of the south 
wall directly in front of the doorway and a narrow 
frame surrounding the door on the north wall, the 
walls of this room have a different texture than the 
other walls in the dungeon. Though most of the 
walls in this region have the same stone surface, 
these are smoother, paler, and (most importantly) 
show no sign of wear. A successful DC 16 Intelli-
gence check confirms that the stone used here is 
not only different, but also that it is strange to find 
it in the dungeon. A successful DC 22 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check reveals the entire room was shaped 
with magic.
Encounter Condition: Echoes 1, Hallowed 1, [Positive 
Energy], Safe
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Buried within the walls are several wands of 
sleep, that Arum built into this chamber. The wands 
were corrupted by the chaotic magic of the region, 
and constantly target the occupants with a desire 
for restful sleep. The walls radiate strong Abjuration 
and Enchantment.
PCs spending more than 5 hours in this room, 
feel a calming peace come over them. The energy 
is soothing and beckons the PCs to stay a while. 
After 5 hours, however, they lose the will to leave. 
PCs trying to leave, must succeed at DC 16 Wisdom 
saves, or rest in a quiet corner for another 8 hours. 
This is a very good rest for the PC but it is hard to 
resist. While they heal at twice the normal rate in 
this room, a DC 16 Wisdom save is required every 
morning to summon the will to leave.

237
237
The key to escaping this perpetual trap is for 
PCs that can leave, to either carry out the ones 
who won’t leave or sleep in another room, until the 
“trapped” PCs gain the will to escape. PCs sleeping 
in the hall (waiting for their comrades) are subject 
to random encounters (once every two hours), while 
the occupants of the room are not.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the slumber take effect in 2 hours rather than 
5 hours. To decrease the challenge, the PCs only 
need to sleep one day here and can leave freely 
the next day.
C45 . FALSE TREASURE ROOM
The floor of this small room is littered with gold 
pieces, though these fail to hide the dusty floor 
beneath. In the center of the chamber is a simple 
stone altar upon which a long double-edged sword 
lies. The sword is fashioned from a silver alloy that 
shines brilliantly when light is cast upon it.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was converted into a false 
treasure chamber by the wizard Arum. A successful 
DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check is required to 
unlock the only door leading into this room, and 
the key that once served that purpose was de-
stroyed long ago.
Anyone touching the sword or the altar triggers 
the trap, which was created by Arum years ago.
 '
Magic Missile Trap. Detect: DC 15 Intelligence 
(Arcana); Disable: DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Characters in a 120-ft. range suffer 4d4+1 force 
damage each.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The longsword is endowed with a perma-
nent magic aura, making it appear as a +3 vorpal 
longsword. In truth, it’s a -2 cursed longsword. The 
gold scattered upon the floor is real and to-
tals 327 gp.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage by 2d4. To decrease the chal-
lenge, the trap triggers only once.
C46 . TRAPPED DOORWAYS
The corridor leading south ends in a strange 
intersection. Upon the eastern wall is a wide 
doorway opening into a dark room. To the west and 
south, short hallways lead to closed doors, each 
with a locking mechanism set above their knob.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The two doors on the southern end of 
this corridor are traps. The first of these doors is 
real, but the second is fake. It is stuck inside the 
stone wall and cannot be opened by any means. 
Both doors have a complex locking mechanism set 
upon them. A successful DC 18 Dexterity check is 
required to unlock either of them.
The first door is rigged with a crushing despair trap, 
which is triggered as soon as any creature passes 
through the doorway.
 '
Crushing Despair Trap. Detect: DC 14 Intelligence 
(Arcana); Disable: DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana); Char-
acters in a 20-ft. square area must make a DC 15 
Charisma save or suffer from bane for 1 hour.
The second door, which is impossible to open – 
though its lock can be picked normally – is trapped 
as well and triggers when anyone touches it.
 '
Acid Fog Trap. Detect: DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Disable: DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters in a 
20-ft. square area must make a DC 15 Dexterity save 
for half damage or suffer 3d6 acid damage.
Though no creatures live in this room, the vargouilles 
in Room C47 are alerted when the trap is sprung.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air, [Smoke]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add cloudkill to the crushing despair trap and 
have the vargouilles (room C47) ambush the PCs 
as they exit. To decrease the challenge, remove the 
acid fog trap.

C47 . ROGUE VARGOUILLES
Both doorways leading into this chamber are wide 
open. Though these once held doors, they were taken 
out long ago. A closer inspection of these archways 
reveals the rusted remains of strong iron hinges.
If the PCs fought the chained howler (Room C43), 
the vargouilles cannot be surprised.
Beyond the empty archway is a large chamber. 
The room is dark and an undisturbed blanket of 
dust covers the floor. The stone floor is scuffed and 
marked under the dust, suggesting that traffic was 
once common here.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Four vargouilles hide in this chamber. 
These creatures recently ventured into the wiz-
ard’s domain and decided to turn this room into 
their new home. They are content to remain in the 
darkness, but attack anyone entering what they now 
consider their lair.
If the PCs use a light source, the vargouilles 
automatically notice them. Otherwise, allow the 
vargouilles the appropriate Wisdom (Perception) 
checks. They remain hidden, waiting for the PCs to 
enter. If it takes more than 10 rounds for the PCs to 
reach their lair after they were spotted, the var-
gouilles come after them instead.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), Conceal-
ment, Fear 14, Fearless, Unhallowed
Tactics: The vargouilles use shriek as soon as they 
reveal themselves (or the moment they are spotted). 
They close in melee, biting their foes. Though they 
do not necessarily fight in unison, these creatures 
are savage and fight to the death. They target the 
weakest opponents first, and do not hesitate to 
attack the wounded.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the vargouilles’ hit points by 6.
C48 . FORMER GREAT HALL
Torches set amidst heavy bronze sconces are 
ablaze, their light revealing a massive stone table 
that dominates the center of this large hall. Broken 
wooden stools and a rotten tapestry (now piled 
in the corner of the room) complete the collection 
of furniture, which is covered with dust. Three 
corridors lead into this place, but the one opening 
in the middle of the eastern wall is blocked.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The Gnashing Fang Tribe previously used 
this room as a meeting hall. Though they have long 
abandoned the place, it remains unchanged.
This great hall is empty and has not seen use 
in years. Only the vargouilles in Room C47 have 
passed through it in recent months. The stone table 
in the center of the place is solid and its surface is 
scarred with various claw marks. These were de-
signed by the gnolls that once lived here, but mean 
nothing special.
The corridor leading east ends abruptly. When 
Arum defeated the hill giant in Room C97, he creat-
ed a permanent stone wall here to block the access. 
A successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
made here reveals that this portion of the wall is 
indeed a wall of stone. It is next to impossible to 
dig through this wall.
There is a barely noticeable irregularity in the 
center of the western wall. PCs succeeding at a 
DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check notices narrow 
grooves upon the stone surface, suggesting that 
a portion of the wall is actually a hidden panel. A 
close examination of this panel reveals a tiny hole 
in its center. The device is clearly some sort of 
keyhole, but its key is yet undiscovered (by the PCs). 
A successful DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check 
is enough to unlock the mechanism. Upon success, 
the panel sinks into the floor, revealing Room C51 
beyond. The secret door closes itself one minute 
after it is opened.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs observing the degraded tapestry dis-
cern faded colors, but no particular image comes to 
mind based on the design. The item is worthless. 
The torches have continual flame cast on them.
Scaling: N/A

C49 . FORMER BARRACKS
Both doors to this room are locked and require a 
successful DC 24 Dexterity check to open.
Eerie lights and dancing shadows project upon the 
walls, distracting you. The room beyond the door 
is in disarray, as if ransacked. Splintered wooden 
bunk-bed frames line the southern and eastern 
walls. Though no mattresses or bed sheets cover 
them now, they could once sleep twelve, and if 
suitable bedding could be acquired, they could 
still be used.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: This room once housed warriors of the 
Gnashing Fang Tribe. Over the years, the tribe 
suffered great losses and eventually abandoned the 
place. Before fleeing, they used this place to trap a 
feral ghoul they were unable to kill. The beast has 
been captive for many months and seeks to destroy 
anyone who enters (including the PCs).
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Fearless, [Safe]
Tactics: The ghoul is fearless and stronger than most 
of its kind. It waits above the door and descends 
on the last person to enter. The PCs need a DC 25 
Wisdom (Perception) check to notice it as they enter 
and gain Advantage only if they are looking straight 
up as they enter (the monster knows exactly where 
to hide in the room’s shadow).
During the first round, the ghoul takes full 
advantage of its abilities, attacking its victim with 
two claws, one bite, and its special rake attack. The 
ghoul’s claws are razor-sharp from many years 
of scratching and sharpening upon the dungeon 
walls, and its critical threat range is increased 
accordingly.
Treasure: A torch imbued with continual flame was left 
behind, perhaps to torment the nocturnal ghoul. 
The torch was broken into many pieces, but the con-
tinual flame still casts light from a single 3-in. piece 
of wood. A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) 
check discovers a gold earring (worth 25 gp) tucked 
between one of the bunks and the wall.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
allow the ghoul to sneak attack the first PC for +3d6 
damage. In addition, at the end of the first round, 
have the PCs make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw 
or be Frightened. To decrease the challenge, have 
the ghoul be surprised by the PCs.
C50 . THE TOMB OF NARR'KRR
Both doors leading into this chamber were sealed 
with thick wax, applied to the inside of the door 
frames long ago. Because of the wax, a successful DC 
17 Strength check is required to open each door.
The doors opening into this chamber are extremely 
hard to push open, but once done, a stench 
emanates from within. Inside this large room is a 
simple wooden desk, a large stool, an iron chest, 
and a wide bed. Upon the bed is the source of the 
powerful smell: a tall humanoid skeleton with bits 
of rotted flesh sticking to the yellowed bones. The 
corpse is dressed in rotten clothing, but a large gold 
torc hangs from a chain upon its neck.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Narr’krr, a powerful gnoll warrior, used 
this chamber as his private abode and office. 
Narr’krr suffered a crippling injury six years ago 
and, shortly after his death, was laid to rest in this 
chamber, and both doors were sealed.
With a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) 
check or DC 11 Intelligence (Nature) check, PCs ob-
serving the corpse can determine this creature was 
a particularly large gnoll.
Encounter Condition: N/A

240
240
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: Upon the desk are a handful of blank scroll 
pages, which are dried and yellowed but still usable, 
and an empty vial of ink. The chest here contains 
rotted clothing and a +1 hand axe. Lastly, Narr’krr 
spent his last few months studying some arcane 
notes and while he never understood them, he hid 
them away in a cache under the table. A successful 
DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a small 
bone scroll case with an arcane scroll in it. The scroll 
contains the spells gaseous form, illusionary script, 
suggestion, and water breathing.
PCs searching the body automatically find a gold 
torc set upon a heavy chain. The chain is made of 
tarnished bronze rings and worth a mere 3 gp. The 
surface of its crescent shape is engraved with multi-
ple tribal designs. It is worth 250 gp in civilization, 
but at least twice as much to a gnoll. Members of 
the Howling Fang Tribe (that never ventured into 
the dungeon), and most Gnashing Fang gnolls 
would pay up to 1,000 gp for such a treasure, as it 
is an heirloom of their people.
If the PCs attempt a trade with Gahrr’k (Room 
C37), a DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check is nec-
essary to get both stone salves for the heirloom. He 
easily trades one for it.
Scaling: N/A
C51 . WIZARD'S LABORATORY
To enter this room, the PCs must find the secret pan-
el in Room C48. This panel resets itself one minute 
after being opened. PCs caught on this side instantly 
notice the irregularity in the center of the eastern 
wall, provided they know where to look. From this 
side, a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check is enough 
to notice the narrow grooves upon the stone surface 
as well as the tiny keyhole in the middle of the panel. 
A successful DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check is 
still required to unlock the mechanism, but the prop-
er key rests on the table in this chamber.
A low table lies in the middle of this chamber, 
which is illuminated by the flames of four torches, 
each set into wall sconces in the corners. Upon the 
table are a variety of clay flasks, glass vials, and 
pots, some of which contain liquids. Beside these is 
a minuscule silvery rod.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Shortly after the escape of the demon in 
room C21 and the terrible deaths of the knights of 
Merunda, Arum discovered this hidden chamber 
and built another laboratory here. Judging by the 
dust covering everything in this room, it’s clear it 
hasn’t been used in some time.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The narrow rod upon the table is the key 
that unlocks the secret panel leading into this 
room. The various flasks contain three potions of 
giant strength, five potions of speed, two potions of 
resistance ( fire), and two potions of cure disease. In 
addition to these items, there are seven empty glass 
vials, three clay jars, two small cooking pans made 
of blackened iron, an alembic, and a host of crude 
alchemical tools. The four torches have continual 
flame cast on them.
Scaling: N/A
C52 . WIZARD'S STUDY
Like the laboratory, the burning flames of torches 
set into each corner illuminate this room. A 
comfortable-looking chair rests at the foot of the 
southern wall, facing the chamber’s only door. 
Beside the chair is a small wooden table, on which 
is placed a thick leather-bound volume, two vials of 
black ink, and an ink pen.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Arum used this chamber to meditate and 
conduct magical research. Like most rooms in this 
part of the dungeon, the furniture is blanketed with 
dust. A closer look suggests that no creature has 
entered this place in years.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The most significant treasure in this 
chamber is an unmarked journal. Written in Dra-
conic (the first half ) and scrawled in Common (the 
second half ), the journal reveals a portion of the 
wizard‘s account.
While trying to gain insight into his future, 
Arum was contacted by a divine entity known as 
Merunda, a minor goddess of the oceans, trav-
el, and vigilance. The deity told him to come to 
the dungeon prison and wait for others to arrive. 

241
241
Shortly after Arum arrived, he performed exper-
iments to discover why extraplanar travel was 
impossible here. After successfully opening a tiny 
extraplanar rift, an angel confronted him (mental-
ly), forbidding him from ever attempting such an 
experiment again. Arum goes on to explain that 
the angel was imprisoned with a powerful demon 
in this area, and that it would not allow anyone to 
release this evil. The journal ends shortly after the 
arrival of three paladins of Merunda.
After several blank pages, the writing contin-
ues, only the handwriting is more chaotic and the 
verbiage more difficult to decipher. PCs succeeding 
at a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check can 
discover the following information.
Arum (now referring to himself in the third per-
son) communicated with what he believed was an 
angel trapped within the dungeon to learn how to 
make his forge more efficient. Following the angel’s 
advice, the wizard placed powerful wards to reflect 
the heat generated by his forge back to it. What 
the wizard had not realized, however, was that the 
wards he placed upon the wall would facilitate Ash‘s 
freedom. It was indeed the cunning demon that 
had communicated with him, not an angel. The de-
tails of the account are vague, but the text is filled 
with remorse. The author blames himself for Ash‘s 
escape, which ultimately led to the Paladins’ fall.
The two vials contain dried and unusable ink, 
but the ink pen is still in good shape. The four 
torches have continual flame cast on them.
Scaling: N/A
C53 . ARUM'S PRIVATE SANCTUM
A wide bed covered with dusty blankets lies at 
the foot of the southern wall of this chamber. 
Beside the bed is a wooden table with a lantern 
on it. There is an iron chest at the foot of the bed. 
Its locking mechanism is clearly visible from the 
room’s only entrance.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This chamber was Arum’s private bed-
room. When the wizard left the dungeon, he 
abandoned some of his personal effects, but did 
not deactivate the trap he placed here. Judging by 
the dust covering everything in this room, it is clear 
that no one has visited in a long time.
The doorway leading to Arum’s chamber is rigged 
with a magical trap (something Arum doesn’t even 
remember doing). Anyone entering the room 
must make a DC 13 Wisdom save or suffer from 
the bestow curse trap. The trap automatically resets 
after 6 rounds. It can affect the same person more 
than once.
 '
Bestow Curse Trap. Detect: DC 19 Intelligence (Ar-
cana); Disable: DC 19 Intelligence (Arcana); Charac-
ters entering the room must make a DC 13 Wisdom 
save or have disadvantage on all Wisdom ability 
checks and saving throws for 24 hours.
Encounter Condition: Cursed 5, Haunted
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The chest at the foot of the bed is locked 
and requires a DC 22 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) 
check to open. It contains two blank spell books, 
three sets of wizard’s robes in various shades of 
blue, and six oil flasks. The lantern upon the table is 
still in good shape. Copper and silver coins with the 
faces melted off are scattered along the bottom of 
the chest.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the bestow curse trap affect Intelligence as well 
as Wisdom. To decrease the challenge, replace the 
bestow curse trap with a burning hands trap.
C54 . GHASTLY GUARD POST
Half a dozen gnoll carcasses lie in the middle 
of this dark room. A closer look at the corpses 
indicates these warriors died years ago in brutal 
combat. The weapons they wielded remain 
with them.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This chamber was once a guard post 
used by the members of the tribe. The bodies are 
six gnolls from the Gnashing Fang Tribe. These 
creatures died at the hands of a powerful hill giant 
that ventured into this section. The tribe aban-
doned this room shortly after this battle, leaving the 
dead behind.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs searching the corpses find three rusty 
great axes, two great clubs, a morningstar, and four 

242
242
large steel shields. One of these shields is a mas-
terwork item. The gnolls also carry a total of 21 gp 
worth of semiprecious gemstones and coins.
Scaling: N/A
C55 . RIGGED FALSE DOOR
Four doors open into this dark intersection. Though 
the three doors set amidst the three different 
eastern walls do not seem to lock, a black iron lock 
is set in the one at the end of the western corridor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The door at the end of the western cor-
ridor is false. It is set in the stone of the wall and 
cannot be opened, but it nevertheless contains a 
complex locking mechanism. The western door is 
also trapped. It was designed to fool the inhabi-
tants into believing that some powerful creature 
was imprisoned on the other side. A successful DC 
21 Dexterity check is enough to unlock the mech-
anism upon the door, but it can unfortunately not 
be opened. Anyone touching the door or lock also 
triggers its deadly magical trap.
 '
Cloudkill Trap. Detect: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Disable: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters in a 
20-ft. sphere must make a DC 15 Constitution save 
for half damage or suffer 5d8 poison damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a cone of cold to the cloudkill trap. To decrease 
the challenge, replace the cloudkill trap with a slow 
trap; its effect lasts 1 day.
C56 . FLOODING ROOM
The floor of this intersecting corridor is surprisingly 
clean, but there is a layer of green moss covering 
the walls, which forms an almost straight line 
around the room some three feet from the floor.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This intersection is rigged with a potent 
flooding room trap. Unfortunately, the powerful 
earthquakes that modified parts of the dungeon 
also damaged this device.
Four rounds after the PCs enter this room, the 
doors shut tightly and loud clicking sounds are 
heard as they are locked into place. Water then 
pours from minuscule cracks upon the floor, 
forming a pool in the room. The water rises at a 
rate of 1 ft. per round, but fortunately for travelers, 
the trap is not as effective as it once was, and the 
water stops rising after three rounds (at the level 
where the moss can be seen). The sound of running 
water continues to be heard until 10 rounds elapse. 
At the end of this period, everything is quiet for 15 
minutes before the water level drops. 10 additional 
rounds later, the water dissipates, and the doors 
instantly unlock themselves.
PCs unlocking any of the doors must succeed at 
a DC 23 Dexterity check or remain trapped inside 
the room. Disarming the trap requires a DC 25 
Dexterity check, which prevents the doors from 
shutting on their own as well as preventing water 
from pouring into the corridor.

C57. Hazardous Tunnel
A narrow tunnel was dug from the bedrock of the 
dungeon, connecting two small chambers together. 
The uneven corridor and the rooms it connects are 
filled with a multitude of stone debris. It’s clear the 
stone boulders tumbled from the walls and ceiling.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Demons imprisoned in the dungeon 
dug a tunnel linking both ends of this room, which 
were once separate. The demons eventually escaped 
when the geography of the dungeon changed, 
centuries ago. Now, however, this room is a dan-
gerous place to be and the ceiling looks like it could 
collapse at any moment.
PCs examining this room notice the precarious 
state of the place. A successful DC Intelligence 
check confirms that journeying through this place 
is dangerous and might result in an avalanche.

243
243
PCs moving through this room must do so care-
fully. They must succeed at a DC 15 Dexterity check 
to avoid a cave-in. Each PC failing this check causes 
several large blocks of stone to fall to the ground, 
dealing 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage to 
everyone in the room. This damage is cumulative, 
so anyone else failing the check adds another 3d6 
points of bludgeoning damage. PCs succeeding at 
a DC 15 Dexterity save cut the damage in half.
Encounter Condition: Tremors 18
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
double the damage caused by the cave-in. To de-
crease the challenge, no extra damage is suffered if 
more than one PC fails his Dexterity check.
C58 . SACKED BED CHAMBER
This room is filled with debris. There are many 
broken wood poles and planks, the remnants of 
a bed, as well as the broken remains of a small 
cabinet. The wooden pieces are scattered about 
the room, and it is obvious that someone, or 
something, smashed everything here.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This chamber once housed the only 
healer of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. This wise old 
gnoll died long ago, however, and his bedroom was 
sacked. PCs looking at the debris also find several 
strips of rotted cotton as well as the dusty remains 
of dried herbs. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Med-
icine) check made here confirms that these items 
were once part of a large healer’s kit.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 23 Wisdom (Perception) 
check through the debris here reveals a universal 
solvent and two potions of superior healing.
Scaling: N/A
C59 . HALL OF MIRAGES
This room is unlike anything encountered 
previously. The walls are made out of dark brown 
whole wooden logs, reminiscent of a comfortable 
log cabin. Upon the southern wall is a thick frame 
made of red bricks that outline a hearth. Flames 
burn within the hearth, raising the temperature 
of the room to a comfortable level. There are 
tables around the room, as well as stools, and 
the trophies of various hunting trips hanging on 
the walls.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Arum set a powerful illusion into this 
hall, as well as a lethal trap. This great chamber is 
reminiscent of a tavern, though without a bar or 
barkeep. Arum placed a powerful illusion here, and 
a DC 21 Intelligence save reveals that this room is, 
like most in the dungeon, cut from stone. Those 
who fail believe it to be a tavern, complete with 
darts, drinks, kegs, and the like. The room is totally 
empty, and the stone floor is cloaked in dust. PCs 
walking 10 ft. or more release a magical trap, which 
affects everyone one round later.
 '
Phantasmal Killer Trap. Detect: DC 22 Intelligence

acters entering room DC 18 Wisdom save or suffer

C60-C68 . PATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS .
This section was originally designed as a deadly path 
preventing demonic and devilish creatures from 
venturing too far. The angel and archon wardens of 
the region could safely walk from Rooms C60 though 
Room C68 and even used some of these chambers 
to rest. However, non-lawful good creatures found it 
more difficult to make the journey.
When Arum discovered this area, he essentially kept 
it as it was. However, he used Room C64 to honor 
the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives 
in the service of their god and who died fighting the 
powerful demon of the dungeon. Arum’s testimony 
of the paladin’s battle is engraved upon the walls of 
this chamber in a maddeningly random combination 
of Common, Draconic, and Abyssal.
PCs will notice that the stone surfaces of the walls, 
floor, and ceiling are whiter in Rooms C61-C67. In ad-
dition, the material from which they had been hewn 
is different than in other parts of the vast complex 
and no dust has accumulated anywhere. Lastly, the 
spotless white stone surfaces of these halls are illu-
minated by an unknown light source, as if under the 
permanent effect of daylight.
C60 . SECRET ENTRANCE
The door leading to Room C61 is actually a secret 
stone panel that is very difficult to notice (DC 30 Wis-
dom (Perception) check). The secret panel upon the 
eastern wall is a 10-ft.-by-10-ft. section of stone that 
sinks into the floor when opened. The secret door 
opens instantly if a PC with the Mark of the Righ-
teous (see Room C21 and C103) walks within 5 ft. of 
it, revealing bright light on the other side. The panel 
remains open for 1 minute before rising back into 
place. A PC with the Mark of the Righteous caught on 
the other side of this doorway needs only to touch the 
secret wall panel to open it.
The corridor widens here but leads to a bare wall. 
There is no dust here, but the place is undisturbed, 
suggesting that no one has ventured into this 
hallway for years.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: If no one has the Mark of the Righteous, 
the PCs cannot gain access to this chamber, and 
thus they cannot reach the eastern rooms of this 
region. Most importantly, the special key in Room 
C103 is unavailable to them. If the PCs never met 
Zrino (Room C21), or if they refused the Mark of 
the Righteous, Zrino arrives, offering the Mark. If 
the PCs attacked the lantern archon, however, he 
is not here.

C61 . GOLDEN WEAPON RACK
The western wall of this chamber contains an 
empty weapon rack. The structure of this fixture 
is composed of four long bars that curve slightly. 
Each of these bars are made of pure gold, 
decorated with a feather pattern. The golden 
feathers are linked to one another and form an 
intricate design. Upon the northern door, written 
in golden Celestial runes are the words: “Leave all 
weapons behind.”
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was designed so that anyone 
entering Room C62 would do so unharmed. The 
weapon rack is enchanted and all those leaving 
their arms behind find the journey through Rooms 
C67 and beyond more pleasant than it has been. 
The rack is also the key to unlock the door leading 
to Room C62. Once a weapon is placed, it cannot 
be removed from the rack, but an exact duplicate 
awaits in Room C67. If the PC returns to this room, 

245
245
the weapon is gone (unless the weapon was placed 
again in Room C67).
A PC with the Mark of the Righteous (see Room 
C21 and C103) walking within 5 ft. of the doorway is 
instantly aware of its existence. They also know how 
to open it, by simply touching the hidden panel. 
Only those with the Mark of the Righteous can 
open it in this fashion, however. When opened, the 
stone panel sinks to the floor.
The secret panel upon the eastern wall of this 
chamber is 5-ft.-by-5-ft. It is made from the same 
white stone as the walls of the room from this side, 
but, on the other side, the surface is as ordinary as 
that of the dark corridor leading to Room C95. Like 
the secret doorway in Room C60, this panel sinks 
into the floor when opened. The panel remains 
sunk inside the floor for 1 full minute before rising 
back into place. PCs without the Mark of the Righ-
teous cannot open this door.
The door upon the north wall is locked. There 
are no obvious locking mechanisms, and it cannot 
be unlocked with normal means. The only way to 
unlock this door, and gain access to Room C62, is 
by placing weapons into the golden rack upon the 
western wall. A minimum of 1 weapon per PC must 
be placed in the rack. Once this is done, the weap-
ons disappear and the door opens by itself, allowing 
the PCs access to Room C62.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 4
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The weapons rack is made of gold and is of 
significant value (2,000 gp or more). It is, however, 
bolted to the wall and magically maintained. PCs 
may pull the rack out from the wall with a success-
ful DC 25 Strength check. Doing so not only cancels 
its enchantment, but also ruins the item, which 
crumbles into a fine black dust. Destroying the rack 
before unlocking the door prevents access to Room 
C62 permanently.

C62 . ANTECHAMBER OF LAW
This square room is empty, but upon the perfectly 
smooth white stone floor is an intricate carving of 
an angel with outspread wings. The angelic figure 
sculpted into the floor holds a wide shield with a 
scale and sword design in its center.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A successful DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) 
or DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the 
symbol on the shield represents Order. This sym-
bol is used by angels and archons, as well as many 
religious orders that uphold the law.
This room contains a powerful device that affects 
all non-lawful beings. Any non-lawful creatures en-
tering this room must make a DC 23 Wisdom save 
or be poisoned for 4d6 minutes. Lawful-aligned 
characters are not affected by this and unarmed 
non-lawful characters who placed all their weapons 
in the rack in Room C61 or Room C67 gain advan-
tage on their save.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 6, Positive 
Energy, Safe
Tactics: N/A

Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the magical device’s saving throw by +3. To 
decrease the challenge, reduce the save DC by -5.
C63 . THE HALL OF LAW
Silken sheets are piled up all along the floor of 
this large hall. There are eight silk blankets on 
either side of the room, placed near the eastern 
and western wall. Though there are no beds under 
them, the blankets look rather inviting. Their deep 
blue shades dramatically contrast the clean white 
walls of the Hall.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was a meditation hall. The 
silken sheets are surprisingly comfortable and lying 
on them feels like lying on a soft feathery mattress. 
Anyone stealing a blanket receives a deadly elec-
trical blast upon exiting through either door. The 
discharge deals 12d6 points of lightning damage, 
but a DC 22 Constitution save reduces it by half.

Lawful PCs resting here will rejuvenate lost hit 
points at a rate of 5 per hour. In addition, resting 
for 8 hours also recuperates 1d3+1 lost points of one 
ability score damage they suffered. Upon awaken-
ing, they are under the effects of bless for 24 hours. 
Non-lawful PCs do not benefit from these effects.
Chaotic PCs find no respite here. No matter 
how long they sleep, they gain none of the bene-
fits normally bestowed by rest. Furthermore, upon 
entering this room, chaotic-aligned PCs must make 
a DC 22 Wisdom save or immediately gain a level 
of exhaustion. Chaotic PCs who left all their weap-
ons in the rack in Room C61 or C67 gain advantage 
on the save.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 8, [Positive En-
ergy], Safe
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, have all chaotic creatures entering this room 
instantly gain a level of exhaustion and raise the 
damage caused by the electrical discharge to 16d6. 
To decrease the challenge, allow non-lawful PCs to 
rest normally in this room and reduce the damage 
caused by the discharge to 8d6.
C64 . AN ACCOUNT OF THE LAST BATTLE
Gouges scar the pure white walls of this hall. The 
markings are letters of exquisite quality carved 
into the stone. The writing is in Celestial, but 
under each phrase are Common runes translating 
the language.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Arum used this room to record the 
account of the brave, final stand of the Paladins of 
Merunda. The account was made by Arum, who 
used both languages to make sure any good soul 
traveling into this chamber would know the truth. 
PCs succeeding at a DC 22 Wisdom (Insight) check, 
can sense sadness in the words and the style of 
writing, as if the writer had given up hope.
PCs reading the inscriptions on the walls learn 
that Merunda (a minor goddess of the ocean, trav-
el, and vigilance) summoned the last of her follow-
ers to this dungeon. At first they did not know why 
the deity had called them to the forgotten place, 
but the servants of the goddess eventually learned 
they were expected to fight the great demon held 
within the confines of a special prison cell. They 
were also expected to die in their efforts. That is, all 
except Arum, whose signature can be found at the 
end of the account.
Moments before the tragic event, the paladins 
of Merunda were told the demon would escape 
its prison and that a mighty angel would slay the 
fiend, provided they sacrificed their lives to help 
it. When the time came, and the demon broke 
through the wall of its prison cell, the servants of 
Merunda stood ready to face the creature. They 
sacrificed their lives to allow the angel to kill the 
demon. Only Arum survived the onslaught, and the 
wizard saw the angel dissolve into thin air once the 
demon was dead.
Though the narrator does not explain the events 
leading to the demon’s escape, he does insist that 
without the efforts of the followers of Merunda, this 
evil would not have been destroyed. And he notes 
that he wrote the account upon the walls to honor 
the memory, valor, and sacrifice of the deceased.

C65 . THE HALL OF GOODNESS
Large sofas of deep blue velvet dominate the 
eastern and western walls of this large hall. In the 
center is a low blue marble table. The furniture is 
elegant and, like the white stone surfaces of the 
hall, surprisingly clean.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Good-aligned PCs entering this hall 
immediately feel relaxed. Those suffering from ail-
ments such as poison, disease, or a curse also feel 
that they could get better if they stay here a while 
longer. Every hour a good-aligned PC remains, they 
are cured of one of the following effects: poison, 
disease, blindness, deafness, curse, or paralysis. 
Non-good PCs do not gain any of these benefits.
For evil characters: this place is beyond unnerv-
ing, if not hostile. Upon entering the hall, they 

247
247
must succeed at a DC 30 Wisdom save or become 
blind and deaf. They also reduce their maximum 
HP by 4d8 for as long as they remain here. Remov-
ing blindness/deafness restores their sight and 
hearing. PCs who placed all their weapons in the 
rack in Room C61 or Room C67 gain advantage 
on the save.

Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter,

in this hall. To decrease the challenge, have evil 
PCs either blind or deaf, not both, and reduce the 
save DC by 5.
C66 . ANTECHAMBER OF GOODNESS
An intricate pattern is carved into the center of 
this room. The design represents a handsome male 
angel with powerful wings protruding from its 
back. The angel upon the floor has one hand above 
his head, partly outstretched in front of him. His 
other hand holds a delicate lyre at his side.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Religion) 
or DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the 
pose of the angel signifies peace. Angels, archons, 
and members of religious institutions frequently 
depict their greatest heroes in this position.
This room is imbued with strong magic that 
affects all non-good creatures. Non-good PCs en-
tering this room must make a DC 22 Wisdom save 
or become frightened for 4d6 minutes and have 
their maximum hit points reduced by 3d6 until the 
end of their next Long Rest. Good characters are 
not affected and non-good characters who placed 
all their weapons in the rack in Room C61 or Room 
C67 gain advantage on the save.
Encounter Condition: [Fear 22], Hallowed 6, Positive 
Energy, Safe
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the saving throw DC by +3 and the hit

reduce the save DC by -5 and the hit point dam-
age to 1d6.
C67 . SILVERY WEAPON RACK
The southern door is locked, but has no locking 
mechanism upon it. It cannot be unlocked through 
normal means and the only way to open it is by plac-
ing weapons onto the silvery shelves. Each PC must 
place at least one weapon in the rack. Like Room C61, 
these weapons cannot be removed.
An empty silver weapon rack is placed upon the 
western wall of this otherwise empty room. The 
rack is made from seven curved bars embellished 
with leafy patterns of wonderful design. The words, 
“Leave all weapons behind” are written in silver 
Celestial runes in the center of the southern door.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Like Room C61, this chamber was de-
signed to allow everyone entering Rooms C62-C66 
to leave their weapons behind. The weapon rack, 
although fashioned from a different material, func-
tions as the one in Room C61. It is also the key to 
unlock the door leading to Room C66.
PCs who left their weapons behind in Room 
C61, and vice versa, find their weapons here. When 
non-evil PCs take their arms from the rack in Room 
C67, they feel the weapons are charged with potent 
energy. The weapons of lawful good PCs become 
+2 weapons. The duration of these enchantments 
lasts for 1 day plus a number of days equal to the 
character’s Wisdom bonus (if any). Weapons may 
not be enhanced more than once per month, so 
PCs journeying through this section several times 
within a short period may not benefit from this 
more than once, unless they place different weap-
ons in the rack.
The magical rack does not enhance the weapons 
of non-lawful or non-good PCs. The weapons of 
evil PCs are imbued with powerful enchantments 
that bestow them a -2 penalty for 1d4+1 days. An 
evil weapon placed in the rack is destroyed and 
never reappears.
Encounter Condition: Hallowed 4

Treasure: The weapon rack in this room is made of 
the purest silver (it is worth approximately 2,000 
gp). PCs can pull the rack from the wall with a suc-
cessful DC 22 Strength check. Doing so, however, 
cancels its magical effect and ruins the item, which 
instantly crumbles into a fine black dust. Destroying 
the rack before unlocking the southern door also 
prevents access to Room C66.
Scaling: N/A
C68 . SECRET DOORWAY
The secret stone panel sinks into the floor, revealing 
a brightly lit hallway leading south. The spotlessly 
clean corridor is narrow and illuminated by an 
unnatural, unseen source. It leads to a simple door.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: A hidden panel opens into the narrow 
corridor leading south. It is impossible to notice, 
but those with the Mark of the Righteous automat-
ically learn of its existence. The secret door is a 5-ft.-
by-5-ft. panel that sinks into the floor when opened. 
It opens automatically if a PC with the Mark of 
the Righteous (see Room C21 and C103) touches it 
and remains open for 1 minute before rising back 
into place.
If no one has the Mark of the Righteous, the PCs 
cannot gain access to this room. If the PCs never 
encountered Zrino (Room C21), or if they met the 
lantern archon but refused the Mark of the Righ-
teous, Zrino appears her now to offer the Mark, 
unless the PCs attacked him before.

C69-C79 . BLACK DRAGON TERRITORY .
Before Arum fled the dungeon, his scattered mind 
created several monstrosities in this section, bring-
ing to life inanimate objects (like the furniture) and 
turning mindless mold into powerful, destructive 
oozes. Months and years passed as Arum hid under 
the shadow of the dragon, before fleeing the region 
in search of clarity and to ease his worried mind.
Over the years this section became home to a 
number of creatures, including hill giants (too stupid 
to stay away), and a number of gnoll patrols who 
eventually learned to leave well enough alone. Now, 
uncontested, a mighty black dragon named Nardarik 
controls Rooms C69-C79. This cunning dragon is 
aware of every secret door and hidden passage in his 
territory. Nardarik is smart and agile, and frequently 
patrols his lair to ensure no other inhabitants enter 
it. While journeying through Nardarik‘s territory, the 
PCs notice several scuff marks upon the floor and 
walls. Nardarik’s claws and scaly body created these 
marks. They are especially obvious in narrow corridors 
and chambers.
When Nardarik encounters the PCs, he is hostile. 
Unless they offer great treasures, the dragon attacks. 
He wants nothing to do with the PCs. However, if 
they buy their way out, Nardarik will honor the bar-
gain and show them to the exit.

C69 . FIRST MARKED ROOM
The surface of the stone floor and walls here is 
heavily pitted and scarred. A closer examination 
suggests that part of the rock face was burned. 
There are also several marks upon the floor, 
suggesting frequent traffic.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The walls and floor of this room are dam-
aged. Their stone surfaces are melted and uneven, 
as though a potent acid had eaten through the rock. 
Nardarik (Room C77), the black dragon that makes 
his lair in this area, is responsible for the markings.
There is nothing special in this room aside from 
the acid-damaged floor and walls. A successful 
DC 12 Intelligence check made here confirms the 
walls and floor were damaged with a strong acid. 

250
250
Another check (DC 15) suggests the acid was thrown 
or projected against the stone surfaces, as though 
through a jet or thrown flask. A third check (DC 
18) reveals the acid’s source was monstrous and 
unnatural.
A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check 
uncovers a simple secret panel at the end of the 
western corridor. This panel is made from the same 
stone as the walls and is just as damaged. It tilts 
precariously upon hidden hinges towards the inside 
of this room when opened. A narrow groove into 
the stone surface allows PCs to pull it open, but a 
successful DC 15 Strength check is required.
Encounter Condition: [Fog 10 or Smoke]

C70 . DEVASTATED CHAMBER
The three secret doors leading into this room are 
simple stone panels that can be noticed with DC 20 
Wisdom (Perception) checks. When pushed with a 
successful DC 15 Strength check, they swing open, 
revealing strong iron hinges hidden within the 
archway. PCs opening the panels from the outside 
must use a narrow groove that grips the panel (also 
requiring a Strength check).
The two secret doors in the corridor to the north-
west are identical to those from this room.
This room is filled with broken furniture, crushed 
boulders, and bone fragments. The debris is piled 
at the foot of the western wall, and a simple 
looking door separates them in two mounds. 
Within the debris are bits of rusty iron, thorns, and 
rotted clothing.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: When Nardarik took control of the sec-
tion, he fought powerful hill giant stragglers. The 
dragon wasted no time hunting down his enemies, 
and the giants made a brave, but futile last stand. 
Casting the room in darkness, Nardarik killed each 
giant, slowly, in turn. Now, only their bony car-
casses remain, along with the devastation wrought 
by Nardarik.
Searching the debris thoroughly takes 2 hours, 
but PCs succeeding at a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) 
check can determine that the bone fragments from 
the detritus resulted from the decay of a number of 
giant-sized creatures. Portions of these bones are 
pitted, twisted, or melted, as though acid had been 
thrown upon them. PCs studying the bones must 
succeed at a DC 16 Intelligence (Nature) check to 
ascertain they come from seven different hill giants.
A DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check made 
here also reveals that behind the debris, portions 
of the western wall are scarred and damaged, as 
though by acid.
Encounter Condition: [Deep Darkness], 
Echoes 4, Fog
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There is nothing of value in this hall, as 
Nardarik stripped the giants of any treasure they 
carried, including their weapons. PCs taking at 
least 20 minutes to search this room uncover large 
pieces of wood, broken iron nails, the dried remains 
of pine branches, and large-but-rotted animal pelts. 
These broken and useless materials framed at least 
ten very wide bunk beds.

C71 . SECOND MARKED ROOM
The westernmost secret door is discovered with a suc-
cessful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The panel 
is simple and made from the same damaged stone as 
the walls. A narrow groove allows the PCs to grip the 
panel and pull it open. This action requires a DC 15 
Strength check.
The floor and walls of this chamber are heavily 
damaged. The stone surfaces are uneven and 
marked with unfamiliar patterns.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Like Room C69, a strong acid heavily 
damaged the walls and floor of this chamber. These 
cryptic marks are a warning to trespassers. A suc-
cessful DC 12 Intelligence check confirms the sub-
stance used to burn and melt the stone was acid.

C72 . HALL OF RUBBLE
A massive pile of stone rubble dominates this great 
hall. Boulders and chunks of broken rocks, all 
neatly put together in the center of the area, form a 
mound almost as tall as the 50-ft high ceiling.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Though the PCs can step into this room, 
it is extremely difficult to move inside it, due to 
the stone rubble scattered everywhere. PCs staying 
close to the walls can make their way around the 
hall, circling the mound, the summit of which is 
roughly in the center of the room. Once rubble has 
fallen, the PCs may move safely.
Encounter Condition: [Fog 10], Hazardous Footing 
16, Tremors 19
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: If the PCs spend 2 hours searching through 
the rubble, they find several bone fragments 
(scarred by acid), a small pile of copper slag, and a 
bag of holding (although the sack looks like any oth-
er, only undamaged). It does not radiate magic.
After 3 hours, allow the PCs a DC 21 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check to discover a dragon slayer dagger 
(magical +1 dagger, deals an additional 3d6 damage 
against dragons). Nardarik could not destroy it, so 
he buried it under a massive pile of rubble.
Scaling: N/A
C73 . TRAPPED HALLWAY
The secret door on the northern end of the corridor 
is easy to spot. The grooves surrounding the stone 
panel are larger than most and there are obvious 
markings (wide scuffs) on the floor around it that 
disappear under the secret panel. A DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check is enough to spot these, and a sub-
sequent DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check is required 
to uncover the hidden button to the east of the panel. 
Pushing this button causes the panel to slide through 
the western wall, disappearing completely.
The westernmost part of the south wall of this 
60-ft.-high corridor is significantly damaged. The 
stone is broken and several piles of rubble lay 
scattered upon the floor, as though some powerful 
force had struck the wall. On the far end of the 
hallway, a single wooden lever juts from the stone.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: At the end of the hallway is a lever (that 
does nothing). It is designed to get someone to 
walk down the hallway. Two rounds after the secret 
door is opened, a potent magical trap is triggered. 
The magic affects the entire length of the corridor, 
from either side of the secret panel. PCs succeeding 
at a DC 19 Wisdom (Perception) check can find a 
tiny locking mechanism beside the secret door-
way. This lock can be picked with a DC 21 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools) check to safely bypass the trap.
When triggered, the trap remains active for 7 
rounds. On the first round, the reverse gravity sends 
all creatures and objects hurling toward the ceil-
ing. Creatures take 6d6 falling damage when they 
hit the 60-ft.-high ceiling. When the spell ends, 7 
rounds later, they fall to the ground as the reverse 
gravity effect ends, taking damage again. A DC 
16 Dexterity save for each fall reduces the dam-
age to half.

C74 . MIMIC'S CHAMBER
This wide hall is vacant except for massive wooden 
shelves dominating the entire northern wall. The 
shelves are filled with vials, leather bound books, 
yellowed scrolls, clay pots, and silvery urns.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A mimic, fearful of Nardarik, remains in 
the form of a large bookshelf filled with trinkets 
to attract anyone foolish enough to enter. It lies 
in wait, ready to attack intruders. Having suffered 
years of torment at Nardarik’s hand, it is eager 
to vent its rage upon those who violate its lair. 

252

It attacks the PCs when someone steps within 5 
ft. of it.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Fearless, 
Poor Footing 4
Tactics: The mimic exudes a thick adhesive, hoping 
to grapple its prey or catch their weapons. Though 
angry, this creature fights intelligently and when 
given the chance, it concentrates its attacks upon 
less-armored opponents.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add one mimic. To decrease the challenge, give the 
PCs an opportunity to spot the mimic.
C75 . FALSE DRAGON'S HOARD
This cross-shaped hall is filled with coins of all 
shapes and sizes. Upon the mounds of copper, gold, 
and silver are crystal candelabras, golden plates, 
silver cutlery, ivory cups, and multiple brightly 
colored jewels.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Nardarik is a covetous creature, with no 
understanding of his true lineage. His reptilian 
mind understands two things: “this is mine” and 
“how do I get more?” Therefore, to protect his 
valuables from gnolls, giants, and whatever beasts 
are too stupid to stay away, he built a false trea-
sure hoard.
The entire room is blanketed with a permanent 
illusional image (DC 20 Intelligence save) making 
visitors believe the room holds incredible treasures. 
PCs rolling a natural ‘1’ on their saves see whatever 
they most desire in the hoard (weapons, power, 
etc.). In reality, the illusion hides a pit trap covering 
most of the floor. Only those who see through the 
illusion can search for the trap (otherwise all search 
checks automatically fail). Anyone stepping on the 
floor triggers the mechanism, which opens a pit 
trap 2 rounds later.
 '
Wide-Mouth Pit Trap. Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 17 Dexterity; Characters in the 
room DC 15 Dexterity save or fall 100 ft. and take

Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There is nothing of value here, as the trea-
sure is just an illusion.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, increase the depth of the wide-mouth pit trap 
to 150 ft. To decrease the challenge, reduce the 
depth to 60 ft.
C76 . GELATINOUS CUBE GUARDIAN
This hallway is completely dark. Like many other 
rooms in this region, the walls are scarred with 
scuffs and narrow markings, as though something 
was dragged across them.
There is a large cube made of bluish translucent 
gelatin in the middle of this hallway. Inside this 
weird cube is a wooden chest reinforced with 
golden brackets. The chest appears undamaged.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: A huge gelatinous cube, born from the 
chaotic magic of Arum’s fractured intellect, has 

253
253
grown to enormous strength. It guards the hall-
way running around the Nardarik’s nests (Room 
C77), with a mimic posing as a treasure chest. The 
mimic’s acid immunity renders it invulnerable to 
the cube’s touch.
These creatures were already here when Nardar-
ik took control of the section and, seeing no need 
to destroy them, the dragon kept them alive for use 
as sentries. The gelatinous cube and mimic remain 
close to the door in the northern stretch of the 
corridor, but can appear anywhere in the room the 
GM wishes.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, [Fear 14], Fearless
Tactics: Should the cube suffer 50 or more points 
of damage, the mimic springs to life and attacks 
the PCs, surprising them (even if they are already 
engaged in combat) unless they succeed at a DC 25 
Wisdom (Perception) check.
The cube attacks mindlessly, engulfing the first 
PC it can. If the cube is successful, the mimic at-
tacks the PC from inside the cube, rather than wait-
ing for an opening. PCs witnessing such an attack 
must succeed at a DC 12 Wisdom save or become 
stunned for 2d4 rounds.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have there be two mimics inside the cube, each 
shaped like treasure chests or desks. To decrease 
the challenge, have the mimic surprise the PCs only 
after the cube suffers 60 points of damage.
C77. Nardarik's Nest
If Nardarik hears the PCs coming (highly likely), the 
room is already cast in darkness. Otherwise, read the 
following.
A great mound of copper, silver, and gold coins take 
up most of the floor space of this vast chamber. 
Among the coins are multiple pieces of jewelry, 
such as necklaces, rings, and bracelets, as well as 
a handful of tapestries, goblets, and utensils. What 
truly catches the eye, however, is the large dragon 
sitting atop his treasure. The creature’s scales 
are deep black, bearing several scars, and shaped 
like jagged diamonds. Fire burns within the pits 
of its eyes.
Initial Attitude: Hostile
Encounter: Nardarik lives here. Though he frequently 
patrols his own territory, he is found here most of 
the time. Like most of his peers, Nardarik is clever, 
cruel, and malevolent. He sees the PCs’ presence 
in his private realm as an affront to his power and 
does not hesitate to attack anyone entering its nest.
In order to negotiate with Nardarik, the PCs 
must first be able to change his initial attitude 
through the use of Charisma (Persuasion) or Cha-
risma (Deception) checks. Unless the PCs tempt 
Nardarik by promising great riches to the black 
dragon, they suffer from a -4 penalty to all Charis-
ma (Persuasion) checks made to change its attitude. 
If the PCs successfully change the dragon’s mind, it 
listens to what they have to offer hoping to acquire 
treasure from them. If the PCs fail to pay at least 
2,000 gp worth of treasure to Nardarik, com-
bat ensues.
Encounter Condition: Ambush (darkness), [Deep 
Darkness], Fearless, Fog 10, Smoke
Tactics: In battle, Nardarik is merciless. If he hasn’t 
already done so, he casts the room into darkness, 
unless the PCs surprise him, in which case he starts 
fighting immediately. Before engaging in melee, 
he uses his line of acid breath (60 ft.), targeting 
spellcasters. Due to his ferocious nature, he does 
not breathe acid as often as he can, repeating this 
action every 1d4+1 rounds.
Once engaged in melee, Nardarik tears into the 
PCs with claw and bite attacks. If too many PCs 
surround him, he tail slaps the largest, reducing his 
opponent’s numbers before returning to his breath 
weapon and claw attacks.
Due to the size of the room, Nardarik keeps his 
distance when necessary and jumps about for a 
better position whenever possible. In the darkness, 
he attacks like a cat, attacking powerful PCs before 
slinking away to stalk them again.
If the PCs are too strong for Nardarik, he uses 
darkness and his powerful breath weapon to escape 
to Room C72.
Treasure: Nardarik‘s treasure hoard includes 8,500 gp 
worth of small gemstones, assorted coins, and var-
ious pieces of jewelry. In a locked (DC 22 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools) check) wooden chest are a number 

254
254
of unmarked vials. A potion of bless and three po-
tions of healing can be found.
In another locked (DC 22 Dexterity (Thieves’ 
Tools) check) chest, strapped closed with bands of 
cold iron, the PCs find one large delicate jade Bowl 
of Commanding Water Elementals, a small lacquer 
box (wrapped in silk) containing brushes and Mar-
velous Pigments, a dark blue Ioun stone, a clear Ioun 
stone, a plain-looking ring of evasion, a ring of three 
wishes (with 0 wishes remaining), a ring of resistance 
( fire) (with a faceted fire opal set in a three-part 
crown), and an amulet of health that only fits small 
or smaller creatures.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
give Nardarik an additional Legendary Action. To 
decrease the challenge, allow the PCs two rounds 
before Nardarik notices them.
C78 . CONVERTED HALL
This oddly shaped hall was probably two rooms 
once, but there are now wide gaps in the east and 
south walls, which open into the second part of it. 
Though there is nothing special here, the walls and 
floor bear many scars. The horizontal scarring of 
the walls suggests that something was dragged up 
them, and it is obvious that the floor was scarred 
with claws or sharp tools.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This hall was once two separate cham-
bers, but the doors, and indeed the entire doorways 
that separated them were destroyed long ago. The 
oversized archways are scorched and a good portion 
of the stone walls surrounding them has melted 
under the effect of an acidic substance.
The secret door in the southernmost portion of 
the east wall is a simple stone panel that has seen 
much use in recent years. Because of this, it is easy 
to discern its discolored shade and the large marks 
around it. A successful DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) 
check is enough to notice it. When pushed, the 
panel opens into the narrow corridor and wide 
chamber beyond.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: After the PCs spend 30 minutes in this room, 
roll for a random encounter. On a 6-14, a gray ooze 
or ochre jelly shuffles into the room.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
a gray ooze is already here, dissolving the stone. To 
decrease the challenge, remove the possibility of a 
Random Encounter.
C79 . GRAY OOZE PRISON
The narrow hallway opens into a wide room. This 
dark chamber is empty except for a puddle of water 
in the northeastern corner.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Nardarik keeps a gray ooze prisoner in 
this room. This creature unwittingly ventured into 
the black dragon’s lair over a year ago and now 
Nardarik frequently visits the ooze to torment it. 
The ooze remains motionless and does not attack 
unless the PCs move within 5 ft., striking the clos-
est target.
Encounter Condition: Ambush, Cover
Tactics: The gray ooze does its best to conceal itself, 
hiding under cover when possible and generally 
avoiding outright confrontation. While mindless, 
months of torture have taught it to lie still and not 
attract unwanted attention.
If combat is inevitable, unarmored PCs are per-
fect targets, suffering the gray ooze’s acidic touch.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add one gray ooze. To decrease the challenge, 
have the ooze recently tortured by Nardarik (-20 
hit points).

C80-C85 . TRICKS AND TRAPS .
Once serving as powerful prisons for demons and the 
like, these rooms fell out of favor when the celestials 
were forced into Regions E and G. Each room in this 
section is trapped with powerful magic, capable of 
bringing the strongest PC to his knees. For thousands 
of years, these rooms have stood as cells, holding 
pens, and “torture” chambers to remind evil creatures 
of the price of disobedience.
Since the area is devoid of inhabitants, and filled 
with traps that discourage travel, Nardarik (Room 
C77) makes no challenge to annex this territory. Most 
inhabitants of the region know about this section and 
avoid it at all costs, leaving the dragon to focus his 
energies elsewhere. The stone floor is covered with 
a thick layer of undisturbed dust, suggesting that 
nothing has entered here in some time. There are no 
random encounters in this section.
C80 . THE WEARINESS OF THE TRAVELER
This room would be perfectly square if it were not 
for a thin wall separating it into two sections. 
Though this wall seems out of place, its surface is 
exactly like the other stone walls in the area. The 
only difference is that it is narrower than what 
would be expected.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is rigged with a potent magi-
cal device that causes a level of exhaustion to those 
journeying through it. Anyone traveling through 
this room, in either direction, falls under its effect. 
Merely entering the room through one door is not 
enough to trigger the enchantment, but PCs enter-
ing the room from one door and exiting through 
the other instantly become Exhausted. This effect 
takes place regardless of the amount of time spent 
inside the room. There is no save and the condition 
persists for 24 hours.
Encounter Condition: [Fear 16], Haunted, Nega-
tive Energy
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add fear to the exhaustion effect. To decrease the 
challenge, allow each PC a DC 16 Wisdom save to 
avoid exhaustion.
C81 . THE BURDEN OF THE WEAK
The floor in this room is covered in a layer of thick 
dust and dirt. With the exception of the seven 
burning torches set upon the eastern wall, the place 
is completely empty. A beautiful sigil crisscrosses 
the stone pattern of the floor, forming an ellipse 
with intersecting circles.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is trapped with a permanent 
symbol (stunning) spell that affects anyone who steps 
on or reads the symbol printed on the center of 
the floor.
If the symbol is touched or read, everyone in 
the room must make a DC 16 Wisdom save or be 
stunned for 1 minute. Anyone who exits the room 
must save again upon re-entering the chamber and 
viewing the symbol.
 '
Symbol of Stunning Trap. Detect: DC 22 Intelligence 
(Arcana); Disable: DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana)
Encounter Condition: [Fear 18]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a symbol (pain) to the symbol of stunning. To 
decrease the challenge, replace the symbol (stunning) 
with symbol (sleep).

C82 . THE STAGGERING STRENGTH
The floor of this room is covered with dust, but 
this substance is darker than most of the dust 
blanketing the other chambers and hallways of 
this region.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: 1 round after the PCs enter this room, a 
powerful gust of wind erupts from tiny cracks in the 
floor. The gust of wind affects everyone in the room 
and sends poisonous ungol dust into the air. Living 
creatures inhaling the dust begin choking immedi-
ately and must succeed at a DC 14 Wisdom save or 
become frightened for 2d6 rounds.
 '
Gust of Wind and Ungol Dust Trap. Detect: DC 18 
Intelligence (Arcana); Disable: DC 18 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools).
Encounter Condition: [Drafty], [Fear 16], Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add chain lightning to the gust of wind and ungol 
dust trap. To decrease the challenge, remove the 
ungol dust and instead have the PCs pelted with 
pebbles and debris (2d6 bludgeoning damage to 
each player).
C83 . THE MIRROR OF TRUTH
This small room is empty except for a large mirror 
mounted on the diagonal northwest wall. The 
mirror is framed in an orange copper alloy that 
reflects light nicely. It is a large but otherwise 
simple piece of furniture.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This tiny chamber is actually a portal to 
Room C84. To pass through the secret door (or even 
discover it), the PCs must face the mirror in the 
northwest corner.
Anyone entering this room must make a DC 17 
Wisdom save to resist the Zone of Truth coming 
from the mirror. Those standing directly in front of 
the mirror, so as to see their reflections, trigger a 
magic mouth. Everyone in the room hears “Shelter 
and comfort await friends who wish it. What is your 
name?” To everyone else, the mirror is empty, but 
those who answer, the mirror see through to the 
other side.
On the other side of the mirror is a lush, yet 
confined room filled with two three-tiered bunk 
beds, a modest table, two chairs, and a wash- basin. 
The mirror is a doorway to Room C84.
Encounter Condition: Distracting Visions
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
C84 . RESTFUL NIGHTMARE
A pair of three-level bunk beds dominates this 
small room. The beds can easily accommodate 
six medium-sized creatures and thick sheets rest 
upon them. In addition to the bunks, there are 
two small chairs, an ivory wash basin, and a large 
wooden chest.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The basin in this room is filled with cool 
fresh water. When water is taken out of it, the basin 
magically refills itself. Regardless of the quantity of 
liquid taken out of it, the basin constantly refills. 
The basin is mounted to the floor and cannot be 
moved or tipped over.
This room was designed to attract demons to 
safety, instead targeting them with a powerful 
nightmare. Any PC trying to rest here is subjected 
to the nightmare.
 '
Nightmare Trap. Detect: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Disable: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters 
resting in the room must make a DC 17 Wisdom 
save or suffer from the nightmare. Those who ut-
tered their true names in Room C83 receive person-
alized nightmares, based on events from their past. 
Those who lied (as demons are apt to, lest they give 
away their true name) suffer Disadvantage to Wis-
dom checks and saving throws for 24 hours due to 
visions of a future that is horrific and inexplicable.
Encounter Condition: [Distracting Vi-
sions], [Haunted]
Tactics: N/A

257
257
Treasure: The wooden chest contains extra blankets 
and pillows for six beds.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encoun-
ter, add phantasmal killer to the nightmare trap. To 
decrease the challenge, replace the nightmare trap 
with a crushing despair trap.
C85 . ANGELIC STATUE
The door to this room is locked. A DC 21 Dexterity 
(Thieves’ Tools) check is required to open it.
A beautiful statue representing a large female 
humanoid with mighty wings issuing from her 
back stands in the middle of this room. Though the 
statue is cloaked with dust, it is clear her eyes are 
made of the purest emerald stones.
PCs who did not steal the emeralds are blessed when 
they leave the room and may rest here as long as 
they like (so long as the emeralds are untouched).
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is anachronistic in relation to 
the rest of the section. It looks and feels alien to 
anything else the PCs have seen so far. Evil-aligned 
PCs must succeed at a DC 14 Wisdom save or 
become frightened for 2d4 rounds after entering 
the room. While this effect is not devastating, it is 
intimidating.
The celestial angel statue in this room is made 
of the same stone as the rest of the dungeon. 
Despite the obvious valueless nature of its material, 
it is a truly impressive work of art. The emeralds 
that make its eyes are priceless and foreign to 
this world. A successful DC 21 Intelligence check 
confirms these gems are entirely unique and alien, 
fetching upwards of 10,000 gp each.
The PCs can remove the emeralds from the 
statue by prying them out with a successful DC 15 
Strength check. Three rounds after the precious 
stones are taken out, they turn into a dull black 
shape and crumble to dust. Soon after, the real 
terror begins.
First, when the gems turn to dust, the bearer 
must succeed at a DC 18 Dexterity save or swallow 
some of the dust, losing 1d8 maximum hp for 1 
week. Second, everyone in the room suffers bane 
for 2d8 days (no saving throw). Third, a beastly howl 
fills the room, chilling the PCs to the bone (eyebite). 
They are allowed a DC 18 Constitution save to 
negate the effect. Fourth, a wave of exhaustion (no 
saving throw) strikes everyone in the room.
Each trap effect triggers one after the other in 
successive rounds.
Encounter Condition: [Fear 18], Fearless, Hallowed or 
Unhallowed, Haunted or Safe, Negative Energy or 
Positive Energy
Tactics:
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the hit point reduction to 2d8. To decrease 
the challenge, reduce the duration of all effects 
to 24 hours.

C86-C94 . NARROW MAZE .
A multitude of narrow corridors make up most of this 
section. Because the outlying territory is so danger-
ous, inhabitants of the region usually avoid this area. 
Two years ago, a group of adventurers found their 
way into the dungeon and entered this region, estab-
lishing a base of operations in Rooms C86-C91. They 
passed away soon after. Signs of their passage can be 
found throughout these isolated chambers.
PCs venturing into the narrow hallways of this area 
must walk single file.
While Room C94 is technically part of Arnuk’s 
(Room C96) section, she avoids it and commands her 
sons to do the same. There are no random encoun-
ters in this section.
C86 . FORMER ADVENTURERS' CHAMBER
Though this small room was originally designed to 
hold a prisoner, the lock was destroyed long ago.
The stench of decay prevails in this room and a 
glance inside instantly reveals the source of the 
foul smell. The body of a dwarf, curled up in the 
fetal position, lies in the southwest corner. Almost 
no meat remains upon the skeletal corpse, but the 
odor of rotted flesh lingers.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Long after its original captive was gone, 
the room was used as a bed chamber. A dwarven 
male lies on a rotted blanket in this bed chamber, 
his cancerous form so diseased it doesn’t even 
attract flies.
Anyone touching or examining the dwarf ’s 
body must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution save 
or contract demon fever. Normally demon fever is 
spread through injury, but this strain is deadly even 
centuries after the demon’s fled the dungeon.
 '
Demon Fever. Incubation period of 24 hours, reduces 
the infected character’s maximum hit points by 2d6 
until the disease is cured.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (demon fever) 14, 
Stagnant Air
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There are three old bedrolls in the cor-
ner, plus a diseased and rotted blanket on which 
the dwarf is sleeping. A successful DC 16 Wisdom 
(Perception) check reveals a leather scroll case and a 
small copper holy symbol (worth 5 gp) hidden in the 
closed skeletal fist of the dwarven corpse. The case 
contains three divine scrolls: calm emotions, freedom 
of movement, and protection from evil.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the hit point damage to 3d6. To decrease 
the challenge, return lost maximum hit points 
after 1 hour.
C87 . OLD HEARTH
A circle of blackened stone lies at the heart of this 
room, with a small pile of gray ashes in its center. 
It is obvious that this was used as a hearth where 
fire once burned, but there is no trace of wood 
anywhere in the chamber.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The adventuring band who lived here 
used this chamber as a common hall.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (demon fever) 14
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) 
check uncovers a half-burnt piece of parchment 
among the ashes. The last words of what must have 
been a long paragraph remains intact: “No one 
knew why they were brought together in the bowels 
of this forgotten place, except that they would 
be needed to turn the tide at some forthcoming 
event. Yet the priests and paladins serving Merunda 
obeyed the will of their deity.”
This parchment is part of Arum’s notes and 
anyone reading “Arum’s Journal” and succeeding at 
a DC 13 Intelligence check notices that the writing 
on the parchment is identical to that of the wizard’s 
journal in Room C52. This is another fragment of 
the accounts of the servants of Merunda who lost 
their lives fighting Ash (Room C21).
Scaling: N/A

C88 . ANCIENT STOREROOM
Five small crates and two large sacks crowd 
this chamber. Though the wood from the 
crates is rotted, some of the items they contain 
appear sound.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Before their demise, the adventurers 
dwelling here stored extra gear in this room.
The door on the west wall is hidden by an illu-
sion, making it appear like the wall. Anyone touch-
ing the “door” must succeed at a DC 16 Wisdom 
save to disbelieve the illusion. Failing this save 
means the PC is fooled by the illusion.
Those succeeding the save realize the stone wall 
is an illusion. The illusionary wall never disappears, 
but those making the save can open the door to 
Room C89. Due to the nature of the illusion, those 
who fail their save will never see it as anything 
but a wall.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (demon fever) 14
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The large sacks contain several long cords 
of rotted ropes, as well as torches, arrows, and 
bolts in similar states of decomposition. Within the 
crates, the PCs uncover the rusty end of a grappling 
hook (with a rotted cord), a well-oiled tent in sur-
prisingly good shape, a hooded lantern, seven oil 
flasks, flint and steel, and a rusted (but still useful) 
masterwork climber’s kit.
Scaling: N/A
C89 . FORMER TREASURE ROOM
In order to enter this room, PCs must first bypass the 
illusory wall in Room C88.
The rotted remains of shelving line the walls of this 
small room. Some of the shelves have fallen atop 
others, crushing whatever items were displayed on 
them in their wake. Others remain in place, but it is 
obvious that they are extremely fragile.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room was once used to store the 
adventurers’ most precious treasures. When the 
surviving members of the band abandoned their 
base of operations, they took most of what was 
valuable in this room.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: There are several broken glass vials, clay 
pots, and wax candles lying among the debris of the 
shelves and at first glance there is nothing of value 
here. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check 
uncovers three unbroken vials of holy water as well 
as a +1 battleaxe laying under the crushed shelves of 
the western wall. The axe’s blade is decorated with 
thick dwarven runes.
Scaling: N/A
C90 . FUNERAL CHAMBER
The only door leading to this chamber is locked but 
not trapped. A successful DC 18 Dexterity check is 
enough to unlock it.
Two stone altars are lined up on the eastern and 
western walls of this chamber and anyone entering 
the chamber sees that something rests upon each. 
Closer inspection reveals two man-sized corpses 
wrapped in gauzy layers of yellowed wool.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Inside are the bony remains of two 
human males and their gear. Sigils were paint-
ed on the wool, but the paint has faded from red 
to yellow.
Anyone touching or examining the bodies must 
succeed at a DC 14 Constitution save or contract 
demon fever.
 '
Demon Fever. Incubation period of 24 hours, reduces 
the infected character’s maximum hit points by 2d6

Encounter Condition: Diseased (demon fever) 14
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: PCs searching the corpses find a master-
work battleaxe, a +2 throwing axe, a rusty, but func-
tional breastplate, a pouch containing 71 gp worth 
of assorted coins, and a small chunk of amber 
(worth 15 gp).
Each of the items is also riddled with disease 
and the GM should determine if the PCs can leave 
without making several Constitution saves.

Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the hit point damage of demon fever to 
3d6. To decrease the challenge, return lost maxi-
mum hit points after 1 hour.
C91 . EMPTY CELL
There is a lock upon the door, but it is busted and 
completely useless.
The door leading to this room has a barred window 
set into it, allowing anyone to gaze inside. The 
floor is cloaked in a thick blanket of undisturbed 
dust. A closer look reveals that the walls of this cell 
have discolored into a dull brown shade, as though 
someone or something had painted them long ago.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This prison cell has not been used in cen-
turies, but once contained a minor demon. A DC 
15 Intelligence check made here confirms the walls 
were painted with blood. The substance dried long 
ago, but its dark shade can still be seen.
Anyone touching or examining the blood must 
succeed at a DC 16 Constitution save or contract 
this powerful strain of demon fever.
 '
Demon Fever (Intense). Incubation period of 24 
hours, reduces the infected character’s maximum 
hit points by 4d6 until the disease is cured.
Encounter Condition: Diseased (demon fever) 14

Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the hit point damage of demon fever to 
5d6. To decrease the challenge, return lost maxi-
mum hit points after 1 hour.
C92 . CRUSHING WALL TRAP
This room is devoid of light or furniture, but a 
narrow pile of broken bones takes up most of the 
central area in this chamber. Crushed skeletons 
are lined up in the middle of the area, forming 
an almost straight line from north to south, as 
if connecting the two corridors opening into this 
room together.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is rigged with a deadly mecha-
nism designed to hold any creature that escaped its 
original cell. The bony remains in the center of the 
room are those of the unfortunate creatures that 
unwittingly ventured here and never escaped.
Three rounds after anyone enters this room, 
the east and west walls quickly move towards the 
center, crushing everyone within one round after 
this trap is sprung, the walls move back into their 
proper places.
A minuscule hidden switch can be found with a 
DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check upon the north 
wall just east of the archway. Pressing this switch 
prevents the trap from functioning for 10 minutes.
 '
Compacting Room Trap: Detect: DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception); Disable: DC 23 Dexterity; 3-round delay. No 
saving throw. All characters suffer 12d6 bludgeoning 
damage after 1 round.
Encounter Condition: [Deep Darkness]
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) 
check is enough to notice an ivory ring on one of 
the fingerbone remains in the center of the room. 
The ring is simple, but it is ancient and undam-
aged. It fits any medium creature and is worth 
upwards of 750 gp to a collector.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the crushing wall trap’s damage to 16d6. To 
decrease the challenge, make the trap deal only 8d6 
points of damage.
C93 . IMPRISONED SPECTER
Due to the design of this room, opening either door 
is not easy. There are four different locks on each 
door. Subsequential DC 18, DC 22, DC 25, and DC 
28 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) checks are required to 
unlock them. If any check fails by 10 or more, all the 
locks reset and the PC must start over. In addition, 
each lock is trapped with a powerful ward that acti-
vates if the lock is tampered with. Each ward is ex-
tremely difficult to notice, as the tiny rune is written 
inside of the locking mechanism.
The first ward is a bestow curse trap.
 '
Bestow Curse Trap: Detect. DC 21 Intelligence (Ar-
cana); Disable: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); Charac-
ters in the room must make a DC 15 Wisdom save 

261

or have disadvantage on all Strength ability checks 
and saving throws for 8 hours.
The second lock is protected by a symbol (sleep).
 '
Symbol of Sleep Trap. Detect: DC 17 Intelligence (Ar-
cana); Disable: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); Charac-
ters in the room must make a DC 15 Wisdom save 
or fall asleep for 10 minutes.
The third lock is protected by symbol (stunning).
 '
Symbol of Stunning Trap. Detect: DC 21 Intelligence 
(Arcana); Disable: DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana); Char-
acters in the room must make a DC 17 Wisdom save 
or be stunned for 1 minute.
The fourth lock is guarded by feeblemind.
 '
Feeblemind Trap. Detect: DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana); 
Disable: DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana); Characters 
in the room suffer 4d6 psychic damage and must 
make a DC 12 Intelligence save or their Intelligence 
and Charisma scores become 1. At the end of every 
30 days, the characters can repeat the saving throw 
until they save. The effect can be ended by greater 
restoration, heal, or wish.
Opening the doors from inside this room requires 
the PCs to unlock only the last two locks, but the 
wards protecting these two are still present.
Five massive columns carved from bedrock support 
the fifty-foot-high ceiling of this great hall. Like 
most chambers in the dungeon, the area is bathed 
in shadows, but the disquieting murmurs of some 
hidden menace echoes through the wide place. 
Strange mirrors on the floor, ceiling, and walls 
reflect light in every direction, casting shadows 
into every corner and distorting the apparent size 
of the room.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This chamber holds one of the few orig-
inal inhabitants of the dungeon: a mighty specter 
named Aslur’thyn, whose cell was so secure, he 
never escaped. Magical wards upon the entire stone 
surfaces of the walls, ceiling, and floor keep him 
inside. Powerful magic imbues the walls of this spe-
cial prison cell, trapping all sound inside. This effect 
acts as silence.
Aslur’thyn has been confined to this cell since 
the dungeon was first built and has lost all hope 
of ever escaping. When the PCs open one of the 
doors leading into its cell, he stares in disbelief for 
one round. Allow him a DC 20 Wisdom save on the 
second round. If successful, he rushes for the door, 
otherwise he waits until the third round to make 
his escape.
Unless the PCs prevent Aslur’thyn from exiting 
the room, he flies past them. If the PCs stand in his 
way or attack him, Aslur’thyn fights back, vent-
ing centuries of accumulated anger. If the doors 
close, trapping him once again inside, he becomes 
furious and gains the benefit of barbarian rage for 
3 minutes.
Encounter Condition: Cursed 4, Distracting Noises, 
Distracting Visions
Tactics: Once engaged in battle, Aslur’thyn is relent-
less and fights until destroyed. He targets the weak-
est PC, drawing him away or sequestering him from 
the rest of the party. He continues to attack a single 
target until either of them is dead. If Aslur’thyn suc-
cessfully kills a PC (who will return as a spawn 1d3 
rounds later), he flees so the PCs are forced to fight 
one of their own.
If Aslur’thyn flees into the dungeon, he escapes 
via the fastest route possible, hiding from the PCs if 
they give chase. If the PCs allow him to escape, he 
immediately looks for victims to convert to spawns 
and within 24 hours commands 1d6 specters. This 
pattern continues until everything is converted 
or the specter finds an adversary more powerful 
than himself.
Aslur’thyn heads north, avoiding the dragon and 
oozes, but attacking any humanoids he finds. If the 
PCs emptied this region, he heads west in search of 
goblins in Region B before heading toward Region 
N. If the PCs chase him to Region F or G, he flies 
across the lava.
Treasure: The specter’s cloak is a black robe of the 
archmagi. The benefits of wearing this robe are 
bestowed to the wearer against corporeal and 
incorporeal creatures. If the PCs destroy Aslur’thyn 
they can take the robe, understanding that it is, of 
course, evil. The cloak is semi-incorporeal and part 
of him, but it becomes substantial when Aslur’thyn 
is destroyed.
The angels hid a powerful tome in this room, 
keeping its secrets from the world. The mirrors 
along the walls are part of the specter’s torment, 
reminding him of these trappings, no matter where 

262
262
he looks. But they also serve a second purpose. If 
the PCs succeed at a DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) 
check, they see a series of nodes on the four out-
side pillars in the mirrors that they cannot see on 
the pillars themselves. The center pillar is devoid 
of these nodes. Clever PCs should note that this 
means something, but a DC 21 Intelligence reveals 
the nodes are part of a grand puzzle.
It takes a while for the PCs to study the nodes 
and note subtle differences in their shape and 
color. After an hour, allow the PCs a DC 21 Wisdom 
(Perception) check to confirm the four nodes that 
are identical. If the PCs can find a way to touch 
them all at the same time (they are all placed in 
such a way that no two can be touched at once by 
a large or smaller being), the center pillar slowly 
opens from top to bottom like a giant puzzle box. 
As each stone shifts, more and more light from the 
pillar’s core releases until 5 minutes later the room 
is bathed in daylight.
Once the pillar is completely opened (a process 
that takes 30 minutes), a small pedestal remains, 
with a book resting on it. This process also disables 
the traps on the locks, until the pillars are reset by 
pressing the nodes again (which closes the pillar). 
The book is shielded by great magic and any PC 
touching it sets off a divine word trap which resets 
in 5 rounds.
 '
Divine Word Trap. Detect: DC 17 Intelligence (Ar-
cana); Disable: DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana); Char-
acters touching the book must succeed on a DC 17 
Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature 
is deafened for 1 minute. On a 15, the creature is 
deafened and blinded for 10 minutes. On a 10 the 
creature is blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 
hour. On a 5 or lower, the creature is killed instant-
ly. Celestials, elementals, fey, or fiends that fail are 
forced back to their plane of origin and cannot 
return for 24 hours.
If the PCs find a way to bypass the divine word 
trap, they can take the book, which is in fact, a vile 
tome containing every arcane necromancy spell 
ever written. Every necromancy spell from the 
wizard, sorcerer, or cleric spell lists in the Player’s 
Handbook is here. It is up to the GM if these spells 
are from other open source material or just so 
powerful and incomprehensible the PCs can never 
learn them. The book radiates strong Necromancy 
and evil. If they do not disable the divine word trap, 
the book can only be removed from the pedestal by 
a lawful good character.
In addition, the surface of the book is protect-
ed by a glyph of warding, which goes off once the 
PCs read the cover. If they open the book to the 
first page, the character must succeed on a DC 17 
Dexterity saving throw, or a magical snake leaps out 
and sinks its teeth into the character, and vanish-
es. The character suffers 6d8 poison damage and 
must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On 
a failure, the damage reduces their maximum hit 
points by an amount equal to the damage taken for 
24 hours. Neither effect can be dispelled or disabled 
and neither harm the book.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a specter or wight, neither of which wants to 
leave but instead intends to convert the PCs into 
the undead. In addition, they can use ‘life drain’ on 
animals as well as humanoids. To decrease the chal-
lenge, place daylight in the center of the room in a 
20-ft. radius that affects Alsur’thyn as sunlight.
C94 . CRUSHING GRATE TRAP
The floor of this great hall is arranged with a 
multitude of square tiles. Gray dust covers most of 
the floor, but it fails to hide the dented and chipped 
stone surface. Within each of the cracks separating 
the floor tiles, caked blood can be seen.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The floor of this chamber is rigged with 
countless pressure plates. Each 5-ft.-by-5-ft. stone 
square making up the floor of the hall is part of a 
deadly mechanism that sends a heavy stone grate to 
the ground. This grate is made of the same stone as 
the rest of the region, is as large as the room, and 
is supported from the ceiling by massive iron poles. 
When more than 50 lbs. are put upon one of the 
pressure plates, the grate descends to the floor and 
crushes everyone inside.
When not activated, the grate looks like it is part of 
the ceiling. The only differences being that there are 
a multitude of small holes (some six inches in di-
ameter) cutting through its surface and dried blood 
is all over it. It can be spotted with a successful DC 
16 Wisdom (Perception) check, which also alerts 
anyone proficient with Thieves’ Tools of the danger.

C95-C102 . HILL GIANTS' LAIR
This section is the home of Arnuk, a hill giant cleric, 
and her two sons. Arnuk’s family was part of a tribe 
that once dominated a large section of this region. 
But when Nardarik (Room C77) came, he killed off 
most of the tribe and drove the survivors away. Arnuk 
and her sons are the only remaining hill giants from 
this once-proud tribe.
To make matters worse, Vernir, one of Arnuk‘s sons, 
once made a deal with the king of the goblins (Room 
B75) to fight the wizard Arum for them. Even in his 
maddened state, Arum was too much for the giant 
and Vernir nearly lost his life. Fortunately, the wizard 
showed mercy and only trapped the giant behind 
several layers of stony walls, rather than kill him. 
Arnuk and her other son now bear a deep grudge, but 
are unaware that Arum is gone. Lastly, the giants no 
longer trust the goblins and seek vengeance, should 
they ever find a way to escape.
Though they are content with their existence, these 
hill giants are trapped in the region and have little 
hope of ever emerging from the dungeon. They do 
not know about the secret door in Room C61, nor 
can they get past the imprisoned specter (Room C93). 
If they ever escape, Arnuk plans to destroy the black 
dragon Nardarik (Rooms C69-C79), the entire goblin 
tribe (Region B), and Arum.
Unless the PCs are Hostile, Arnuk asks them to do 
her bidding by talking about the great riches stolen 
from her people by the evil dragon Nardarik, as well 
as the treachery of the Gnashing Fang Tribe. If the 
PCs agree to help Arnuk get rid of her enemies, they 
are welcome in her lair. If the PCs do not want any-
thing to do with the hill giants, Arnuk and her sons 
insist that they exit their private domain. If the PCs 
know a way out, they handsomely reward them and 
offer an alliance.
Due to the size of the corridors, the giants are rare-
ly found outside Room C97. Their speed is cut in half 
in these tight hallways.

C95 . PRISON CUBICLES
This room is divided into smaller sections by a 
number of walls. Though these walls are made 
from the same stone as the rest of the chamber, 
and indeed most of the dungeon, they are thinner 
and obviously designed to break the room into 
small cubicles. Within each of these cubicles, rusted 
iron chains and manacles hang from the walls.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is segmented into smaller 
alcoves where minor demons were kept in chains 
centuries ago. There are enough chains and man-
acles in this chamber to keep 14 medium creatures 
shackled. Though the chains are rusty, they remain 
solidly encased within the walls. The manacles, on 
the other hand, have all been forced open and are 
now completely useless.
The secret door on the northeastern wall is 
seldom used nowadays, but the stone is marked 
with several dents and its edges are beginning to 
crumble. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) 
check is enough to notice the stone panel, which 
can be easily pushed open.

C96 . BONE ROOM
Large bones litter the floor of this room, covering 
most of its stone surface. The bones seem old and, 
judging by the accumulated dust upon them, have 
not been disturbed in a while. Within the debris are 
several skulls, which resemble humanoid heads, 
only bigger.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: Arnuk and her sons piled the remains of 
some dead hill giants here. A successful DC 15 Intel-
ligence (Nature) check confirms the bones are those 
of hill giants. Twelve corpses can be found.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: This room is filled with hill giant bones 
from Arnuk’s former tribe. A successful DC 25 
Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a golden tooth 
in a giant’s jaw. The tooth is large and made of pure 
gold (150 gp).
Scaling: N/A
C97 . BROKEN WALLS
PCs in Room C48 can hear a soft clamor of metal 
on stone, coming from the other side of the wall 
of stone. However, because the stone is so dense, 
they cannot determine that a hill giant is pounding 
away at it.
The sound of stone breaking upon stone echoes 
throughout this chamber and beyond. Inside the 
wide hall is a large giant in tattered hides. The male 
giant stands in the middle of the room, surrounded 
by massive mounds of stony rubble. One of its eyes 
is swollen shut, as though it suffered a tremendous 
blow. The creature seems hard at work, as it 
takes heavy boulders, raises them above its head, 
and throws them as hard as it can against the 
surrounding walls, which are heavily damaged from 
years of such abuse. Each time the giant throws 
a boulder, it refuses to fragment into smaller pieces.
Initial Attitude: Varies
Encounter: A small portion of the east wall is a cor-
ridor blocked with a wall of stone. A DC 18 Intel-
ligence (Arcana) check identifies it. When Arum 
fought the hill giant Vernir, he encased him in 

265
265
stone in this great hall. Though his family eventu-
ally freed him, Vernir frequently visits the cham-
ber, hoping to demolish the stony remains of his 
former prison.
Vernir spends most of his time in this hall 
smashing the stone walls created by Arum. The 
rubble is from the damage Vernir dealt to the 
stonework over the years. Because Vernir is working 
and not paying attention to what goes on around 
him, he suffers from Disadvantage to any Wisdom 
(Perception) checks.
If one of the PCs is a male human spellcaster 
(in dark-colored robes), Vernir is hostile and at-
tacks him on sight. Otherwise, his initial attitude 
is unfriendly, as he is suspicious of humanoids. If 
the PCs talk to Vernir, the hill giant mutters “You 
should not be here. This is mother’s territory.” 
To reinforce his comment, he demands a 20 gp 
toll from each of them. If the PCs pay the toll, or 
if they convince Vernir they mean no harm, he 
brings them to his mother in Room C98. If the PCs 
promise to leave the hill giant’s domain, Vernir still 
insists they pay the toll.
Encounter Condition: Cover, Echoes 5
Tactics: If there is a battle here, Vernir’s mother 
and brother do not come to his aid. Both giants 
are accustomed to the constant din of breaking 
boulders and crashing rocks. Unless the PCs make 
some kind of unusual noise the other hill giants 
remain in place.
In combat, Vernir takes cover behind a stone pile 
and throws boulders at the party. He targets the 
spellcasters first. If forced into melee, he handles 
the enemies within his reach, using his massive 
steel maul.
Treasure: Vernir carries a pouch with 11 bloodstones, 
worth 20 gp each.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a damage die to each of Vernir’s attacks. To 
decrease the challenge, Vernir becomes Frightened 
when a PC casts an offensive spell at him or uses 
magic to do anything “obvious.”
C98 . HILL GIANT SHRINE
If the PCs make any noise or use a light source in the 
corridor leading to this chamber, Arnuk automatically 
notices them.
A stone altar dominates this chamber. Upon the 
altar is a pair of human skulls inside of which 
yellow candles are set. The candles burn with a 
pale golden light, illuminating portions of the 
room. Behind the altar is a giant female. Her long, 
disheveled hair is tangled with small bones and 
a scorched human skull hangs from a thick gold 
chain around her neck.

266
266
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: Arnuk built a crude shrine to her deity 
in this wide chamber, and the hill giant priestess 
spends most of her recreational time here. Unless 
the PCs have harmed one of her sons or they attack 
her immediately, Arnuk is more than willing to 
negotiate. She is especially interested in the drag-
on’s hoard (Room C75) and killing the black drag-
on guarding it. If the PCs appear interested, she 
reveals where it is and even warns them about the 
deadly creature in Room C76 and the trap in Room 
C94. She does not know Room C75 is a false hoard.
If the PCs offend her god or harmed one of her 
sons, Arnuk attacks immediately.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: If battle ensues, Arnuk casts divine favor on 
herself followed by shield of faith. She then pro-
ceeds to cast an offensive spell to harm or hamper 
the PCs, targeting the warriors of the party first. 
Since she has a 10 ft. reach, she keeps the PCs at 
bay for a round or two, at least, before using her 
magical mace to crush her enemies. She continues 
to cast spells when not engaged directly with two 
or more PCs.
Arnuk utters loud cries and curses while com-
bating the PCs, which automatically alerts her son 
Mourgir (Room C101). Mourgir comes to defend 
his mother 1d3 rounds later.
Treasure: In addition to the magical items Arnuk 
carries, she also has a pouch with 79 pp, 51 gp, and 
19 sp, as well as three glass vials of unholy water. The 
unholy symbol upon her neck is made from a paint-
ed human skull and worth upwards of 25 gp to any 
follower of the faith. The golden chain upon which 
it is set is also worth 25 gp.
Scaling: To decrease the challenge, take away Arnuk’s 
warhammer.
C99 . VERNIR'S CHAMBER
A massive bed made of broken logs, crushed tree 
branches, and dried leaves occupies most of the 
floor area of this room. The crude bed is covered 
with tattered animal pelts and is large enough to 
accommodate a pair of giants. Beside it are several 
perfectly round rocks.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This room is the private bedchamber 
of Vernir, Arnuk’s youngest son. Vernir uses this 
chamber to rest, but spends most of his time in 
Room C97 . Since he does not trust Mourgir (Room 
C101), he carries his bloodstones with him, leaving 
only battered skins on his bed.
If the PCs make noise, Arnuk (in Room C98) 
automatically hears them and investigates 1 round 
later. Also allow Mourgir the appropriate Wisdom 
(Perception) check to notice the PCs. If he hears 
them, Mourgir arrives in 1d3 rounds.

C100 . ARNUK'S CHAMBER
Four old beds are arranged in the middle of this 
room, taking up most of the floor. The beds are 
lined up against one another and a thick layer of 
animal skins covers them. On top of the pelts is a 
human skull, neatly placed at the exact center of 
the four beds.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This is Arnuk‘s private abode and she 
does not tolerate anyone coming into her bedroom. 
Although she is only here when she rests, the room 
is close enough to her shrine that she can keep an 
eye on it. She investigates 1 round later and does 
not hesitate to attack would-be thieves. Allow Mour-
gir (Room C101) the appropriate Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check to notice the PCs. If he does, the hill 
giant comes out of his bedchamber and arrives here 
1d3 rounds thereafter.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) 
check reveals a wooden coffer tucked under a bed. 
This chest is unlocked and contains various robes 
fashioned for a giant as well as a total of 541 gp 
worth of assorted coins and gems, a well-wrought 
sapphire (worth 500 gp), and a wand of mag-
ic missiles.
Scaling: N/A

C101 . MOURGIR'S CHAMBER
A large pile of crushed stone rubble covered 
with broken twigs and branches dominates the 
northern area of this room. A dark-haired giant 
dressed in hide armor sits atop the uncomfortable-
looking bed.
Initial Attitude: Unfriendly
Encounter: This is the private bedroom of Mourgir, 
Arnuk’s eldest son. Though the hill giant sometimes 
patrols his mother’s domain, he spends most of his 
time in this chamber, dreaming about the fresh air 
of his mountain home. For such a savage crea-
ture, he is (at times), noticeably sensitive. As such, 
his mother is more protective of him than Vernir 
(Room C97).
Although suspicious, Mourgir is curious about 
the PCs and eager to talk with them. He is especial-
ly interested in tales of the open country and the 
mountains surrounding the dungeon. If the PCs 
are friendly and tell stories, his attitude automat-
ically shifts to friendly. If, on the other hand, they 
harmed his brother or mother, or if they tried to 
steal from Room C102, Mourgir does not hesitate 
and attacks.
Encounter Condition: Stagnant Air
Tactics: Mourgir does not throw rocks, preferring 
instead to charge the strongest warriors and en-
gage in melee. He fights until his hit point total 
is reduced to 25 or less, at which point he flees for 
Room C98. If combat breaks out here, Arnuk (in 
Room C98) arrives 1d3 rounds later.
Treasure: Mourgir wears a large necklace made of 
carved bone fragments (worth 20 gp) and carries a 
pouch with 97 gp worth of small gemstones.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add a damage die to each of Mourgir’s attacks. To 
decrease the challenge, have him frazzled by a re-
cent argument with his brother, and thus suffering 
from the effects of bane.
C102 . HILL GIANTS' STOREROOM
A rounded, flat boulder blocks the only entrance 
leading to this room, which is used by the giants to 
store the various goods they found in the dungeon. A 
successful DC 22 Strength check is required to move 
the boulder in front of the door. This action, however, 
automatically alerts Mourgir that someone is trying 
to enter the store. Since he is in charge of it, the giant 
comes out of his chamber (Room C101) to investigate 
1 round later. If Mourgir engages the PCs in battle, 
his mother (in Room C98) joins the fray 1d3 rounds 
after combat begins.
Three piles of round rocks and a wide mound of 
broken bones take up most of this room, which is 
used for storage. Upon the southernmost wall is a 
collection of weapons and other gear. Trinkets lie in 
an untidy pile near this equipment.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: There are piles of boulders here, as 
well as skull trophies and the like. The body of an 
adventurer can be found among the debris as well, 
stripped of its gear and left to rot. Fiendish GMs 
can make the adventurer a familiar face from one of 
the PCs’ past.
Encounter Condition: N/A

Treasure: Along the south wall are three large great-
clubs, a rusty greatsword, two disheveled halberds, 
an ornate masterwork falchion, a medium suit of 
masterwork full plate armor, a +2 large steel shield, 
three coils of 50-ft.-long hempen rope, two empty 
backpacks, and a small wooden box containing 16 
wax candles.

C103-C105 . THE KEY
The doors of this section of the dungeon have not 
been breached since the angel wardens abandoned 
it. Built within the vast prison complex, this area was 
used to store an important key. This special key opens 
the door in Room B21 (and thus gives access to Re-
gion F). It can be found in Room C105, but can only 
be handled by PCs bearing the Mark of the Righteous 
(see Room C21), as it is an animated object; attacking 
anyone not bearing the Mark who touches it.
To complicate things, the angel builders of the 
dungeon designed a false key (in Room C103) as well 
as a series of six interconnected rooms (C104) made 
to deceive would-be robbers.
There are no random encounters in this section.
C103 . THE FALSE KEY
Both doors leading into this room are locked. Anyone 
succeeding at a DC 23 Dexterity check unlocks them.
The walls of this room are beautifully painted. 
The pictures depict various angels performing 
blissful tasks. Some hold weapons and stand at 
attention. Others are sculpting great works of 
art or designing tall buildings. Though thick dust 
covers the floor of this room, its painted walls 
are surprisingly clean. What truly catches one’s 
attention, however, is the glowing silvery key 
resting upon a simple stone altar in the southern 
nook of the chamber.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The only purpose of this room is to 
deceive others into believing a false key is the key 
needed to unlock the door in Room B21. Unlike the 
keys found in Room C104, this false key is a perfect 
replica of the one fitting into the lock of Room B21. 
When inserted into this lock, however, a powerful 
sonic blast is triggered and the fake key melts into 
the mechanism, preventing anyone from unlock-
ing the door.
Anyone with the Mark of the Righteous (see 
Room C21) is allowed a DC 15 Intelligence save to 
learn this key is a fake.
The secret panel upon the south wall is impos-
sible to notice or open by normal means. A PC with 
the Mark of the Righteous is automatically made 
aware of the secret door and only needs to touch 
it to watch the panel sink into the floor. The secret 
doorway remains open for as long as someone with 
the Mark of the Righteous stands within Room 
C103 or the adjacent Room C104.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: The only treasure in this room is the false 
special key upon the altar.
Scaling: N/A
C104 . RIGGED FALSE KEYS
The only door leading into these six interconnected 
rooms is locked. A PC succeeding at a DC 21 Dexter-
ity check unlocks it. Each of these rooms holds 20 
different keys, hanging at varying heights from the 
ceiling on strands of wire above a simple stone altar. 
The keys vary in size, shape, and color. Each is made 
from a unique material.
A small altar lies in the middle of the south wall. 
Hanging from the ceiling are several keys of various 
sizes, shapes, and materials. Some are made of 
silver, gold, bronze, copper or steel. Some of wood, 
granite, ivory, colored glass, semi-precious stone, 
and alien material you’ve never seen before.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These six chambers hold a total of 120 
false keys (20 per room) made to confuse, hamper, 
or harm trespassers. Each key is different. Some 
are trapped, while others are mere trinkets serving 
no real purpose. Every time a PC picks up one of 
the keys, roll on the following table to determine

This key is made of glass and reflects light like a prism. The wielder believes he gains true seeing 
from it, but instead cannot lie while holding the key.
10This key makes everyone else appear invisible when held.
11
This key projects legend lore in the mind of the wielder, reciting the entire history of the dungeons. 
It takes 100 years to watch the entire vision, but the PC is allowed a DC 15 Wisdom save each day to 
stop watching.

This key grants the wielder water breathing, but the inability to breathe air. A DC 15 Wisdom save is 
required to drop the key. Only one save is allowed per day.

creatures. A DC 16 Wisdom save is required to drop the key. Only one save is allowed per day.
17This key alerts all lawful and good creatures in a 500-ft. radius of the wielder’s presence.

wish, or similar spell-like effect. The curse is up to the GM but should minor, like stumpy fingers or 
constant dry mouth.

272
272
All keys (except 20) radiate strong Abjuration and 
Evocation. A PC with the Mark of the Righteous (see 
room C21) is allowed a DC 16 Wisdom save in each of 
these six rooms to determine all 20 keys are useless.
If at least one PC already has the Mark of the 
Righteous, he is instantly made aware of the secret 
doorway in the north wall in the easternmost room. A 
PC with the Mark touching the panel watches it sink 
into the floor.
Otherwise, this secret door is impossible to see.
C105 . TEST OF CHARITY
The door of this room opens when the PCs step into 
Room C104, but remains open only for 5 rounds. PCs 
need to succeed at the Test of Humility in order to 
discover this door. However, this secret panel also 
shuts as soon as one person enters this room. It is 
impossible to open once it is closed, but PCs on ei-
ther side succeeding at a DC 28 Dexterity (Acrobatics) 
check can move in or out of the room before the door 
closes. The door opens by itself once a PC selects an 
item from one of the cubby-holes.
There are three items in the cubby-holes against 
the northern wall of this otherwise empty room: 
a chest filled with gold pieces, a beautiful golden 
rose, and an intricate sword with a strange runic 
mark on it. Above the items are the words “Choose 
from the Heart”, written in silvery Celestial runes.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: In order to pass the Test of Charity, the 
PC must select an item and explain why he chose it. 
The actual item chosen by the PC is not important, 
but what they plan to do with it is.
There is no correct answer.
It is up to the GM to determine as best they can 
what motivated the PC in their selection. Charita-
ble motives include taking one of the treasures to 
offer it to another, to a faith, or a cause. If the PC 
was charitable, they pass the test. If they were not, 
they fail.
Once any item is touched, the rest disappear. 
Failing the test sends a powerful electrical dis-
charge of chain lightning through the room. All 
characters must make a Dexterity save for half dam-
age or suffer 10d8 lightning damage.
Succeeding the test results in the PC receiving 
the Mark of the Righteous (as explained in Room 
C21) and all benefits it bestows, including being 
allowed to enter Room C103.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: It is recommended that this encounter be run 
individually with each PC. The answer to each ques-
tion should not be heard by the others, to gauge 
the honesty of their remarks.
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the damage of the electrical discharge to 
16d6. To decrease the challenge, reduce the dam-
age to 8d6.
C105 . THE REAL SPECIAL KEY
The secret panel leading into this room is impossible 
to see or open by normal means. A PC with the Mark 
of the Righteous is automatically made aware of this 
secret doorway. They need to touch the panel to make 
it sink into the floor. The secret door remains open 
as long as someone with the Mark of the Righteous 
stands in Room C105 or the adjacent Room C104.
An untraceable light source simulating daylight 
illuminates this chamber. The walls, floor, and 
ceiling are painted white and their surfaces are 
surprisingly clean. In the center of the room is a 
simple altar made from the same painted stone. 
A silver key, glowing brightly in the magical light, 
rests upon it.
Initial Attitude: Helpful or Hostile (see below)
Encounter: This room holds the real special key 
allowing the angels and archons that built the 
dungeon to move from Room B21 to Region F. The 
only way to gain access to this room is by having 
the Mark of the Righteous. Once the door opens 
for a PC with the Mark, others can accompany 
them inside.
The silvery key on the altar is a special animated 
object. When picked by someone with the Mark of 
the Righteous it remains inanimate, just as any oth-
er key. However, if someone without the Mark takes 
the key at any time or place, it becomes animated 
and flies around the room trying to avoid capture. 
If destroyed, the key becomes useless. Otherwise, it 

273
273
can be used to unlock the door in Room B21, thus 
giving access to Region F.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: This animated object targets creatures not 
bearing the Mark of the Righteous and never strikes 
those blessed with such a Mark. It fights until de-
stroyed, but if a full round elapses without anyone 
trying to strike it, it ceases to attack and falls prone 
(as if it were not animated). If this happens, a PC 
with the Mark of the Righteous can pick it up. If 
someone without the Mark takes it again, however, 
it becomes animated again and flies off.
Treasure: The special key rests upon the altar. It is the 
only key that unlocks the door in Room B21.
Scaling: N/A
C106-C110 . THE FINAL MILE
Rooms C106-C110 are isolated from the rest of the 
region. Though they connect with Region G, and the 
base of the angels and celestials inhabiting this part 
of the dungeon, no creatures have graced this area in 
many years.
There are no Random Encounters in this section.
C106 . THE ANGELS' INSIGNIA
The floor of the corridor is blanketed in undisturbed 
dust. The double doors at its northern end are 
cast from solid bronze. Upon them is a design: a 
flaming sword encircled by a ring of feathers.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: These corridors connect Region C and 
G together. Though there are no traps here, the 
bronze double doors in these corridors are locked. 
A successful DC 21 Dexterity check is required to 
unlock them. The insignia upon them is the symbol 
of the Order of the Children of the Inner Light, the 
group of angels and celestials in charge of protect-
ing Region G. The symbol marks the beginning of 
their territory.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: N/A
C107 . TRAPPED CORRIDORS
This hallway is dusty, dark, and empty. A closer 
look at the floor reveals a rune in the center of the 
corridor. Though covered with dust, the design is 
easily spotted, as it is over 10-ft. in diameter. The 
marking represents an angel holding a wide blade, 
its feathery wings spread wide behind its back.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: The corridors to the east and west of 
Room C108 are trapped. The designs upon the floor 
in each of these corridors are meant to attract the 
attention of travelers. The patterns take the entire 
width of the hallways and are at least 10 ft. long. 
Anyone stepping upon the markings or touching 
them automatically triggers the magical trap placed 
upon them. There is no way to bypass these traps, 
and creatures flying above the designs automatical-
ly trigger them.
 '
Glyph of Warding (Explosive Runes). Detect: DC 19 
Intelligence (Arcana); Disable: DC 19 Intelligence 
(Arcana); Characters in the hallway DC 14 Dexterity 
save for half damage or suffer 5d8 thunder damage.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the save DC of the glyph of warding trap by 
+4. To decrease the challenge, replace the glyph of 
warding trap with a burning hands trap.
C108 . INTRICATE MOSAIC
A large and perfectly round mosaic made out 
of stones of varying shapes and colors takes up 
most of the floor of this chamber. The mosaic is 
exquisitely designed and its many patterns are 
abstract and fascinating. They are somewhat 
reminiscent of the complex patterns made by the 
artisans who fashion the marvelous carpets in 
the Southern Realms, yet a thousand times more 
elaborate.
Initial Attitude: N/A

274
274
Encounter: The floor of this chamber is rigged with 
a simple but effective pit trap. A closer look at the 
mosaic reveals the colorful stones composing it are 
not attached to the floor and could be extracted 
from the pattern. Anyone touching the stones from 
the mosaic or stepping upon them automatically 
triggers the pit trap. When activated, the floor of 
the entire room opens, sending all the stones from 
the mosaic inside a deep pit.
PCs who do not disturb the mosaic can 
move safely through the room without trigger-
ing the trap.
 '
Pit Trap. Detect: DC 18 Wisdom (Perception); Dis-
able: DC 22 Dexterity; Characters in the room DC 17 
Dexterity save or fall 100 ft. and take 10d6 blud-
geoning damage each.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: At the bottom of the pit trap are bony 
remains of a dead unidentifiable creature. A golden 
armband (worth 190 gp) is attached to one of the 
bones and a +3 halberd rests under them.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
add another 40 ft. to the pit trap. To decrease the 
challenge, reduce the trap to 60 ft.
C109 . DISPIRITING HALL
A series of torches set 20 ft. from the floor into 
thick bronze sconces burn here. The dancing flames 
illuminate the great hall, but fail to keep the eerie 
shadows very far.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This great hall is empty but endowed with 
powerful angelic magic meant to discourage living 
creatures from venturing through it. Lawful good 
creatures are not affected by the enchantment, but 
all other living beings are, including outsiders such 
as demons.
Upon entering, all non-lawful good PCs must 
make a DC 21 Wisdom save or become disheart-
ened for one full week. A disheartened character 
suffers from a -2 morale penalty to attack rolls, 
damage rolls, AC, saves, and skill checks. A remove 
curse is not strong enough to lift this effect, but 
each one reduces the duration of the effect by 1 day.
Encounter Condition: Cursed 5, Fear 16
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: All 40 torches are imbued with con-
tinual flame.
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
increase the Wisdom save DC by +2 and add one 
week to the disheartening effect. To reduce the 
challenge, reduce the effect to 1d4 days. Alternative-
ly, it only affects non-lawful characters.
C110 . THE GATEWAY
A wide ornate archway dominates the southern 
wall of this great hall. The archway opens into a 
surprisingly vast room, but the rest of the hall is 
empty and dark. A close examination of the cloak 
of dust upon the floor here reveals that no one has 
walked here in years.
Initial Attitude: N/A
Encounter: This chamber has a magical gateway that 
allows travel to Room C21, but offers no means 
of exiting.
This hall has a portal identical to the large ornate 
archway in Room C21, with the exception that the 
interior of the archway is not solid. Instead, it opens 
into Room C21, just as if the two chambers were 
connected. This is the one-way entrance into the 
prison cell where a great demon was once held 
prisoner. Any object that goes through the archway 
from Room C110 instantly comes out the other 
archway in Room C21. Inanimate objects that par-
tially pass through the portal can be retrieved, but 
anything living or organic is stuck in Room C21. 
Nothing from Room C21 can travel back through 
the portal in this hall.
Encounter Condition: N/A
Tactics: N/A
Treasure: N/A
Scaling: To increase the challenge of this encounter, 
have the PCs lose limbs if they stick their hands 
through the portal and pull them back. To decrease 
the challenge, allow the PCs to move back and forth 
without fail, indicating the wards protecting this 
prison vanished decades ago.
