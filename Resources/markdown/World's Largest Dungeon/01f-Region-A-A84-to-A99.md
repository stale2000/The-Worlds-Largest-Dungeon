# Region A (continued)

## A84. Green Ice

The door to this Room is closed and cold to the touch. Anyone pushing open the door suffers 1d4 cold damage. No save. Once the door is open, read the following.

> The lighting inside the room is strange. There is an amber glow coming from somewhere, but it is unclear where the source is. The ceiling, floor, and walls of the Room are covered in a thin layer of translucent green ice. A simple dark gray box rests atop a stone pedestal in the center of this room. Two dead orcs lie at the foot of the pedestal.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The temperature of the Room is extremely cold. Characters spending too much time here suffer 1d4 damage (no save). Repeat this as often as necessary.

A one-foot-long dark gray stone box rests atop the ornate pedestal. Glyphs and sigils cover the edges and legs. The box has soft rounded edges, and it seems to devour both heat and light. The inside of the box is laced with cultivated yellow mold that bursts in a 10-ft. cloud when the box top is lifted.

**Box of Yellow Mold:** A cloud of poisonous spores bursts forth. All living creatures within 10 ft. must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save or suffer 1d6 points of immediate Constitution damage for 24 hours. After 1 minute, they must succeed on the same save to avoid a further 2d6 points of immediate Constitution damage. Creatures reduced to 0 Constitution die immediately. DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find, DC 13 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to disarm.

Note that even if a PC succeeds at the first check, he is still required to make the second save.

The lid of this box is weighted, so it always drops back down to close unless it is held open.

If either Turag and/or Boyikt are with the party, then either one of them can warn the PCs about the box (though the dead orcs should be warning enough). Whether they choose to do so, especially Turag, is another story.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** One of the keys the PCs found elsewhere in the dungeon opens the box without setting off the trap.

**Treasure:** A +2 ritual dagger rests inside the box. It cannot be held by evil or chaotic characters, however. Well. It can. But it does not confer a magical bonus to them.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, remove the dead orcs. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, reduce the damage of the mold to 1d4 and 2d4.

---

## A85. Sleep Trap

The southern door to this Room is closed and pulses with static electricity. Anyone pushing open the door suffers 1d4 lightning damage. No save.

The western door to this Room is closed and coated in a thick gray slime and some blood.

Once either door is open, read the following.

> The lighting inside the room is strange. There is a purplish glow coming from somewhere, but it is unclear where the source is. The ceiling, floor, and walls of the Room are splattered with blood, fur, and bits of skin. An ivory tusk, less than a foot long, rests atop a stone pedestal in the center of this room. Two blackened pigs lie on the floor, guts splayed out, the bodies covered in maggots and flies. Oddly, there is no odor.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** There are two fiendish panthers resting in a corner of the Room. But the Room is so dark it has to make them out against the purple light (DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check). They have not touched the dead pigs and will not eat them.

On the pedestal is a tusk (see treasure). Should anyone touch it, a flare trap and sleep trap go off simultaneously — though the sleep trap only affects the PC touching the tusk. Whether the PCs successfully save against these trap effects or not, the flare negates the use of darkvision and low-light vision for 15 minutes.

**Flare Trap:** Creatures within 20 ft. must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. Trap resets after 1 round. DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm.

**Sleep Trap:** Roll 7d8 to determine how many hit points of creatures this affects. Creatures within 20 ft., starting with the creature with the lowest hit points, fall unconscious if the total roll exceeds their current hit point total. Each time a creature is affected, subtract their hit point total from the remaining pool before affecting the next creature.

Turag and/or Boyikt know nothing about these traps, but they have seen this Room configuration before. They may or may not warn the PCs and definitely do not enter the Room.

**Encounter Condition:** Ambush (darkness), Concealment

**Tactics:** After the sleep trap triggers, the fiendish panthers spring into action and attack whoever is left standing, gaining surprise on the first round. Assuming, of course, the PCs didn't spot the panthers earlier.

Although aggressive, these fiendish panthers do not fight to the death. Being reduced to 50% or fewer starting hit points is enough to make a panther flee.

If healthy, the panthers pursue fleeing PCs.

**Treasure:** The tusk is carved with faint, archaic runes and shaped like a weapon, complete with pommel. It is a dagger of venom, radiating faint necromancy, and is evil, though it cannot be thrown like a normal dagger of venom.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add darkness to the trap that triggers one round after flare. In addition, having never seen the Room before, Turag and/or Boyikt consider the Room safe. To decrease the challenge, remove the surprise round.

---

## A86. Refuse Room

The secret door at the end of the western hallway is easy to find, as the smell of garbage seeps through the cracks in the door. It rotates on a central pintel but is rather wide when opened.

There is no door to this Room. The smell starts long before the PCs reach the doorway.

> A bubbling mass of garbage covers most of the floor. The smell is unbelievably bad. Here and there, the handle of a broken tool or piece of furniture peeks out from the morass. Rotting matter is everywhere. Dead rats can be seen on top of the trash. The sounds of rats under the surface can also be heard.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This place is a refuse heap and, except for a 15-ft.-by-10-ft. area in front of the hallway, is filled knee-high with garbage. The bubbling of the garbage is caused by three fiendish rats swarms (hp 18, 16, 13) moving beneath the filth.

The smell is bad enough to require a DC 13 Constitution saving throw as the PCs approach the Room. Failure indicates that the PC is considered poisoned while within range of or inside this Room (the poisoned condition lifts 1d4 rounds after exiting the area).

Any PC spending more than a single round in the Room is also subject to catching an airborne variant of filth fever.

**Filth Fever:** DC 11 Constitution save. On a failure: in 1d3 days, Dexterity and Constitution are each reduced by 1d4 until the disease is removed. Repeat save every 8 hours. Filth Fever ends after three consecutive successful DC 11 Constitution saves.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The fiendish rat swarms are busy rooting through the garbage and have a tough time noticing the PCs (disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks), especially since the strong garbage smell completely masks the PCs' odor from the rodents' scent ability. Of course, once the PCs are noticed, a general squeaking alarm echoes as rat waves rush out from the garbage.

The fiendish rat swarms vigorously defend the trash pile and chase the PCs out of the Room if they flee.

The swarms flow over the adventurers, covering as many PCs as possible in their 10-ft.-by-10-ft. area. Only one fiendish rat swarm may cause damage to a given PC each round, even if he is within the space occupied by two swarms; there simply isn't enough space.

In addition to the smell and the disease, the garbage signals an additional danger. Over the years, it has been outgassing, and given the tepid nature of the air in the dungeon, this gas has been building up. The churning of the fiendish rat swarms has released this gas, which represents a great hazard at this point. Any open flame (such as a torch or spell such as burning hands) that enters the area ignites the gas. This creates a non-magical 5d6 fireball that covers the entire Room plus the first 10 ft. of the hallway (Dexterity saving throw, DC 15 for half damage).

PCs without the scent ability have trouble distinguishing the smell of gas from the smell of garbage unless they succeed at a DC 18 Intelligence (Nature) check or a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Any creature with the scent ability can figure out that gas is present. Note that just because a PC notices the gas does not mean that the fire hazard becomes evident.

**Treasure:** A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a +1 longsword among the debris, should anyone be brave enough to dig into the trash, though this risks disease again.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a fourth fiendish rat swarm. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, decrease the fireball damage to 3d6.

---

## A87. Secure Prison

The door to this Room is closed and trapped with two traps. The first trap is a scything blade trap. Pushing the door open releases the blade, which is located on the interior wall next to the doorframe, so that it swings down and cuts the hand of anyone pushing open the door. A hidden bolt near the top of the door can be slid into place to block the blade from falling (DC 15 Wisdom check to find). A counterweight resets the trap the moment the blade has finished its path of travel.

**Scything Blade Trap:** +6 to hit, one target, 3d8 slashing damage. DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.

The second trap is a lightning trap that triggers whenever a Tiny or larger creature crosses the threshold. The lightning strikes down from the lintel to the floor and can affect only the creature within the doorframe at the time of the triggering.

**Lightning Trap:** Deals 5d8 lightning damage. Creatures take half damage on a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. Resets after 1 round.

Any humanoids with the PCs are unable to tell about the exact nature of the traps. They can share with them the fact that it is more than likely trapped. If they so choose.

Once the PCs open the door, read the following.

> This was clearly a prison cell at one time — shackles everywhere — and then refurbished as an armory. The large room is home to a number of weapons mounted on the wall. From polearms to swords, from axes to bows, the collection seems to be missing nothing. In addition, a number of suits of armor also hang about the room.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** N/A

**Encounter Condition:** Drafty

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The weapons themselves are actually well taken care of and can be put to use immediately. In addition, each weapon is etched in both dwarven and giant runes, providing the origin and name of the weapon. The weapons are considered unique masterpieces worthy of gifts to kings. Depending on how much treasure the PCs have amassed so far, the GM should consider making one or two items magical.

The following arms and armors are readily available (each item appears only once):

- **Tailored for a Derro:** Studded leather armor, buckler, short sword, repeating light crossbow (a light crossbow without the loading tag), and a vial of green blood oil hanging from a chain on the crossbow.
- **Tailored for a Drow:** chain shirt, light shield, rapier, hand crossbow, a vial (single dose) of Drow poison hanging from a gold chain that, in turn, hangs from the chain shirt.
  - **Drow Poison:** On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be rendered unconscious for 1 minute. At the end of 1 minute, the affected creature can repeat the save. On a fail, the creature is unconscious for 24 hours.
- **Tailored for a Duergar:** chainmail, heavy shield, warhammer, light crossbow.
- **Tailored for a Dwarf:** scale mail, heavy shield, war axe, short bow.
- **Tailored for a Human:** chainmail, medium shield, longsword, light mace.
- **Tailored for a Kobold:** leather, spear, sling.
- **Tailored for an Orc:** studded leather armor, falchion, javelin.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the damage of the lightning trap to 7d8. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, decrease the damage of the lightning trap to 3d8.

## A88-A93. The Lair

The rather large chambers from Room A88 to A93 were used as everything from living quarters to prison dens to workshops. Although the humanoids freely explored these areas, they were considered too large by either side to defend properly and were generally left alone.

The presence of a community is still obvious. The accumulated debris of years of occupation litters the floor (disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in these Rooms), and the sharp eye can make out nonsense graffiti.

Currently these Rooms are proving an attractive site to a large swarm of fiendish darkmantles; the flying beasts find the open spaces a pleasure to be in. Each member has selected an area and only leaves it to go hunting in the dungeon.

If any of the orcs from Room A81 are with the PCs, they are all too familiar with the area, having retreated through. They gladly and ferociously attack any fiendish darkmantles they encounter.

---

## A88. Lair Entrance

Both doors to this Room are open.

> The floor of this large room is covered with debris, and settled dust coats everything. Three hulking shapes can be seen in the darkness on the other side of the room.

Should the PCs take their eyes off the beasts in this Room, they notice:

> Footprints cut through the dirty floor, indicating someone was here recently. Someone without shoes. They came in from the south and exited through the door in the north.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Three fiendish axe beaks currently occupy this Room. They entered through the opposite door from the PCs a few moments ago. In addition to the axe beaks, include any creatures that may have retreated from Rooms A89 and A90.

Once the PCs move further into the Room, they notice a couple of orc corpses lying against the opposite wall. They would have been food for the axe beaks, but now they have the PCs to contend with.

**Encounter Condition:** Concealment

**Tactics:** The fiendish axe beaks are in an uneasy truce with each other and keep a wary eye out. Because of this, they do not work as a team and roll initiative separately.

Although aggressive, these fiendish ax beaks do not fight to the death. There are two exits, so it is easy for one to make an escape if/when reduced to half hit points. They do not respond to the sounds of combat in Room A89 or Room A90, but should they retreat into Room A89, they join the fiendish forces there.

If the PCs retreat, the fiendish ax beaks do not follow.

If the PCs attempt to close the doors in this Room, the fiendish ax beaks are quite capable of opening them again.

**Treasure:** A DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals a tattered sack wedged into a corner of the Room and covered with dirt. It is filled with 23 small polished gems, each worth about 5 to 10 gp each. They are the treasure of a kobold who hid them from the rest of the humanoids, but he never returned for them.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two fiendish darkmantles waiting to drop on wounded PCs. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, remove one fiendish ax beak.

---

## A89. Ancillary Lair

Both doors to this Room are open.

> The floor of this large room is covered with dust and debris. Dead flying octopi litter the floor. A trio of wild boars feed on the carcass, treating it like a toy. Other large pieces of meat are scattered around the room. Two large rats feed on something in the corner.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Three fiendish wild boars and two fiendish dire rats make their home here. They have made their way down from Room A103, killing and replacing darkmantles as they go, and now feed on the dead.

Rotting, dismembered orc corpses and dead fiendish darkmantles indicate there was a fight here. And either the boars were in on the fight, or they are enjoying the leftovers.

**Encounter Condition:** Concealment, Cover

**Tactics:** No one is looking for a fight. They have plenty to eat, but all of the fiendish wild boars take a defensive stance when the PCs enter. The plans of the dire rats are not immediately known. They wait to respond to the PC's actions. Anything overtly aggressive sends the fiendish dire rats to the opposite doorway, joining forces with whoever is in Room A88 or Room A89.

The wild boars charge on the first round of combat, gaining an advantage on their attack and damage rolls.

**Treasure:** Searching through the decaying orc corpses, the PCs find 15 sp, a whetstone, four hatchets, and a preserved plum in a dirty sack. It is unclear how the plum has not rotted yet. Is it magical?

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one additional fiendish wild boar and have them fight aggressively. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, remove the dire rats.

---

## A90. Larger Horrors

Both doors to this Room are open.

> Debris and dust cover this abandoned room. Some furniture or crates were here once. It is unclear. All of the wood has been smashed beyond recognition. Four wolves with black fur tug and pull at the remains of a recently deceased kobold.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** In addition to the wolves, include any creatures that may have retreated from Rooms A88 and A89.

Three fiendish darkmantles and dire rats are dead on the ground, obviously killed a while ago. But the kobold's body is fresh, and the wolves want that.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Though playing tug of war with the kobold corpse, these fiendish wolves work as a team in battle, circling around a single enemy if they can. They are not timid and are unlikely to run. They gain advantage on any fear-based saving throw and work with any creatures that retreated into this Room.

The largest wolf performs a special trip attack on the second round of combat, attempting to get the largest PC on the ground. This is a special grapple requiring a contested Strength check, which the fiendish wolf gets a +3 on. If successful, the PC falls prone, and another wolf can attack him.

If the trip attempt fails, the wolf does not try it again.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two additional fiendish wolves who perform the special trip attack on round one at advantage. To reduce the challenge of this encounter, remove one wolf and/or have retreating creatures continue through the north exit.

---

## A91. The Strong Survive

All of the doors to this Room are open.

This is a complicated encounter with numerous creatures. Some retreating creatures may have made it here. GMs may want to scale this encounter back, regardless, or suffer numerous character deaths.

> This is an extremely large chamber. Although debris covers the floor, several areas of higher traffic are visible from the numerous doors that lead in and out of this room. Numerous shapes can be seen through the haze of the room, the smell unmistakable and fiendish.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This is the largest and most centrally located Room in this part of the dungeon. Accordingly, numerous fiendish creatures are here, trying to get their bearings, having just come through the gateway in Room A103.

Orc and kobold bodies litter the floor, along with numerous darkmantles, rats, stirges, and an out-of-place goblin who stumbled in here from Region B.

Slightly bewildered, several fiendish creatures are here. One fiendish owl bear, two fiendish ax beaks, three fiendish wild boars, three fiendish darkmantles, three fiendish stirges, and four fiendish dire rats present, in addition to any retreating creatures.

The darkmantles and stirges hide in the ceiling rafters above, waiting for their opportunity. A DC 15 Wisdom check is required to spot them.

**Encounter Condition:** Concealment

**Tactics:** The PCs cannot possibly surprise the creatures in this Room if they fought in Room A90 beforehand. Retreating monsters will alert them of combat. However, they are still confused and fight at disadvantage on the first round.

The fiendish owl bear is already wounded and covered in blood. It stands in the center of the Room, surveying who or what to attack first/next. The fiendish ax beaks keep their distance from the owlbear, keeping their eyes on the entering PCs. The two fiendish wild boars are already feeding on carcasses alongside the fiendish dire rats.

The fiendish darkmantles are wounded from a previous fight and wait on the ceiling for an opportunity to feed. The fiendish stirges, while not wounded, are hungry and waiting for their moment to strike. These two creatures are the most likely to retreat north or west if things get too hairy.

Because of the scale of this encounter, it is broken down round by round, assuming specific creatures are alive that long. All creature types roll initiative separately.

**Round One:** The owl bear attacks a nearby wild boar. The ax beaks close the gap with the PCs but do not attack. The boars charge the first PC, attempting to take them down. The dire rats retreat to a safe corner and wait.

**Round Two:** The owl bear turns its attention to the PCs, charging into the fray as if someone has used magic on it. The ax beaks attack whoever is closest while the wild boars push through the party. If a PC has been separated and exposed, one of the darkmantles and two of the stirges attack. At the end of the round, one of the darkmantles bathes the room in darkness, regardless.

**Round Three:** The owl bear fights the closest thing it can find. The same goes for the ax beaks and boars. All of the darkmantles descend on whoever is weakest. The stirges do not hesitate to mob a single PC.

**Round Four:** Whoever is left standing continues to fight.

**Round Five:** Monsters start to retreat. Anyone with less than half hit points makes a run for it. They most likely head west, but the dire rats know of the food in Room A92 and retreat there. If any PCs have fallen, the boars and rats are the first to feed on their bodies. The stirges want fresh blood.

**Treasure:** There is likely to be some coinage among the dead bodies but little else of value. The goblin wears a necklace with a key-shaped pendant on it. It is unclear what it goes to, but nothing in this Region.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two more fiendish dire rats. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, remove all of the fiendish stirges.

---

## A92. Nowhere to Hide

The door to this Room is open.

> The floor of this L-shaped room is covered with the usual debris, including bone, blood, and broken weapons. The number of dead bodies indicates this was a final holdout for the orcs, who took many creatures with them.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This Room was the final holdout against the fiendish creatures. Whatever remained of the orcs died here, their bodies chewed on by their enemies. If the fight in A91 becomes too much, the PCs or the fiendish creatures may fall back here.

One of the dead orcs died of disease and shows no sign of battle wounds. His gear remains untouched, though perhaps still affected by the black mold.

**Encounter Condition:** Fear 12

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## A93. Annex

The door to this Room is open.

> The melted body of two flying octopus creatures lie in the doorway. They are splayed open and still warm, as though the fight just happened. Beyond, the area appears to have been a ready room. Broken arrows, spear tips, discarded swords, and the like lay scattered across the dirty floor. The smell of dank air and sweat lingers as though the room is still crowded with orcs and other humanoids.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** Boyikt (Room A34) killed these fiendish darkmantles with a flaming sphere during a costly battle before he retreated north. The rest of the broken weapons were part of Longtail's mustering of forces before marching on the chapel. These events did not happen at the same time.

The Room is filled with a number of potential storylines, including a troglodyte who is still in hiding or a lost kobold who doesn't want to fight anymore. The details are left to the GM's discretion.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The Room is a great place for illusions, bad memories, and more fiendish creatures to explore. Keep the PCs guessing.

**Treasure:** A thick lump of unprocessed copper ore lies wedged into a corner next to a small shovel. It looks as though someone was trying to chip away the copper from the rock to no avail.

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## A94. Isolated Room

The door to this Room is closed. Bright light shines from under the door.

> As you open the door, the sound of silence resonates. The Room is ablaze with a bright light that seems to come from nowhere. Your lids cannot bear the light, and you squint to almost blindness to shield your eyes. Blurry figures form inside the room. They wave their arms? Legs? It is hard to discern what is happening.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** This Room was used as an isolation chamber. The sound dampening and bright magical light were seen as methods of punishment. While sound does travel through the Room, it is slow and never louder than 40 or 50 dB.

Once the PCs' vision clears up, they can see a tense standoff between the three figures: two kobolds and an orc stare at one another, no one daring to move.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The humanoids are ready to throw down but turn their attention to the PCs, who may or may not be a threat. If the PCs start a fight, the orc and kobolds join forces against the party. Otherwise, the humanoids do not strike first.

If a fight does break out, everyone attacks at –2 penalty, plus any sunlight penalty their species suffers.

There is an opportunity to talk things out, however. And while the orcs and kobolds will not join the PCs, they are happy to talk things out rather than fight. They are just so damned tired.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one more orc and one more kobold. To decrease the challenge of the encounter, have the orc standing over the bloody bodies of the kobolds.

---

## A95. The Long Room

The door to this Room is closed.

> This long room appears quite empty except for the lone chest at the far wall and a single orc corpse lying next to it. The smell indicates the orc has been dead for some time. Something has chewed away at the bottom of his boots and feet. Along the back wall is a freshly painted mosaic in a crude style. It shows a town on fire with numerous little people running around.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** While the door is perfectly safe, and the chest is too, the ceiling above the chest is not. The actual trap is a scorching ray trap that activates the moment a Tiny or larger creature approaches within 5 ft. of the chest.

**Scorching Ray Trap:** Three rays of flame attack up to three targets within 10 ft. +6 to hit, 2d6 damage per ray. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) to notice, DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) to disarm. Automatically resets after 10 minutes.

**Encounter Condition:** Fog 10

**Tactics:** If any humanoids are with the PCs, they have heard of the long Room with the lone chest. While they don't know the chest is empty, they can, if they choose, warn the PCs of the trap.

**Treasure:** The chest is unlocked and empty. A thorough search reveals a false bottom filled with numerous gold and silver coins from a dozen different empires. There are over 100 gp worth of coins, but they are worth even more to a collector.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of the trap, add another ray to each triggering of the trap. To decrease the challenge of the trap, change the scorching ray to a burning hands trap.

---

## A96. Light and Lizardfolk

The door to this Room is closed and warded with a fire trap. It was placed on the door by Slissth, the lizardfolk druid, and triggers the moment someone opens the door. The trap is designed to alert the lizardfolk and give them time to prepare for intruders rather than kill anyone.

**Fire Trap:** Deals 3d6 fire damage in a 5-foot radius. Creatures take half damage on a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm.

Read the following text once the PCs open the door.

> Something scrapes across the ground as you push open the door. To your surprise, you see light within this room, not the flickering light of a torch but a solid, steady light. And the ominous sound of something moving...

If the lizardfolk have had time to prepare, read the following.

> A hot, fiery green sphere lights up in front of you, catching some of you ablaze.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** The reason for the scraping noise is a couple of rocks that have been wedged against the door for precisely this purpose. The rocks slow the opening of the door (it takes one full round to open the door after the discharge of the fire trap), and they also provide a warning to the room's occupants in case the fire trap is somehow bypassed.

The two lizardfolk are the guides that led Longtail's expedition to this dungeon. They rest here while weighing their options. Although they resisted entering the dungeon, they were forced to do so when the fiendish wererat refused payment. Once inside, they were trapped like all the rest.

The duo initially kept to themselves, living on the fringe of the reptilian settlement as the other humanoids explored the place. When the conflict broke out between the troglodytes and orcs, the lizardfolk sided with the troglodytes out of necessity. However, they were of limited use given their reliance on light and were fortunate not to be killed. With the appearance of the beasts, the duo sought their escape from this Region as quickly as possible and recently made their way here.

Both lizardfolk wear continual flame pendants, which are the lizardfolk's most vital possession. Without them, they would be unable to navigate their way through the dungeon.

**Encounter Condition:** Soft Cover

**Tactics:** Both Kalhiss and Slissth are sitting across from the doorway, and as soon as they hear sounds in the hall, they prepare themselves. The odds of hearing anything beyond the closed door are slim (disadvantage to the lizardfolks' Perception checks due to the door and distance), but they definitely hear the discharge of the fire trap (unless it was disarmed).

If time permits, Kalhiss readies his bow and holds an action triggered by the first creature that comes through the door while Slissth casts flaming sphere (green-colored) and rolls it toward the doorway. Slissth stops the flaming sphere in the doorway, forcing any creature trying to move into the Room to get past it while Kalhiss fires arrows at any creature that tries.

After, Slissth prepares to cast green flame blade and moves to deal with any creatures that survive the flames and Kalhiss' arrows, leaving the flaming sphere in the doorway. Slissth's animal companion, a medium viper (T'lakiss), coils around Slissth's shoulders. It defends the druid by biting any creature that engages in melee with the druid.

Once the lizardfolk recognize that it is the PCs and not some humanoids or obviously bestial denizen of the dungeon that opened the door, they hesitate a moment in their attacks. They call out to stop, but the PCs may not hear them over the clamor.

If the PCs attack, the lizardfolk defend themselves to the death if need be. If the PCs also halt their actions and request a parley or otherwise stand down, the lizardfolk are willing to talk (Slissth keeps the flaming sphere in the doorway, just in case).

The lizardfolk know that their chances of surviving in a dungeon environment are slim at best, and the appearance of the PCs gives them greater hope. They are willing to forge an alliance, assuming that the PCs prove themselves trustworthy. You can use a Charisma (Persuasion) check based on the lizardfolk attitude of indifferent (DC 13) if you don't want to roleplay the exchange. Give the check disadvantage if there are other humanoids with the PCs. Even if the result of the check is a failure, the lizardfolk still ally themselves with the PCs, though cautiously.

The lizardfolk are the most reliable allies the PCs can find in this Region. They kept themselves out of the fray and thus have made no enemies among any of the humanoids. Furthermore, they judge their allies on what they do, not what they say or who they are. The more the PCs help the lizardfolk, the more they help the PCs.

The lizardfolk are intelligent enough to realize that if the PCs are traveling with orcs or kobolds, it is out of necessity and not because they share the same outlook on life. Thus, it is quite possible that if and when the other humanoids turn on the PCs, the lizardfolk will stand by their new allies.

Because these two kept their distance from the other humanoids, they know little about the inner workings of the other humanoid groups. They can tell about the journey to the dungeon but are unaware of the exact purpose that Longtail had in coming to the dungeon. They both suspect that it was he who released the extraplanar beasts. They cannot pinpoint the wererat's location because they have not seen him, but Kalhiss knows that all the creatures have come from the northeast.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase Kalhiss' and Slissth's levels by one or two. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, decrease Kalhiss' and Slissth's levels by one or two.

## A97. Treasure Vault

The door to this Room is open and the doorway is trapped with a hypnotic trap and a burning hands trap, which trigger in succession. The traps trigger the moment any creature of Tiny size or larger enters the doorway.

**Hypnotic Trap:** Creatures within 15 ft. of the doorway must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed by this effect, the creature is convinced there is nothing worthwhile in the room and no reason to enter it. Indeed, they actively persuade other creatures to leave the place alone, claiming a vision of hideous monsters inside, waiting to consume any who enter.

**Burning Hands Trap:** 3d6 fire damage. Creatures take half damage on a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. Automatically resets after 1 round. Note: A PC charmed by the hypnotism trap cannot save against this fire damage.

> A couple of broken crates are all that remain of interest in this otherwise empty room.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This was a minor treasure vault. While not one of the great repositories of wealth within the dungeon, it still contains a considerable sum of money. The effectiveness of the hypnotic trap means none of the region's inheritors ever made it inside. Quite the opposite, in fact; if there are any humanoid inhabitants of the dungeon with the characters, they say they've heard of this room before–of its horrifying reputation... no one, they say, has ever entered and returned alive. The fact is, none ever entered in the first place, but the story has grown in the telling.

**Encounter Condition:** Negative Energy

**Tactics:** Roll for a random encounter once the trap has been triggered. If creature(s) are rolled, they are stuck inside the Room, unwilling to risk the trap again. They cannot be surprised and are ready to fight once the traps have been sprung.

**Treasure:** 4000 gp in a number of chests, along with eight small rubies (5 gp each) and a signet ring bearing the crest of the dungeon's original creators (worth 200 gp to the right antiquarian).

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the traps affect two PCs. To decrease the challenge of the encounter, remove the Burning Hands trap.

## A98. Forgotten Torture Chamber

The door to this Room is closed and trapped. The doorway is trapped with a hold person trap and a burning hands trap, which trigger in succession. The traps trigger the moment any Tiny or larger creature enters the doorway. It only affects the creature in the door.

If there are any dungeon denizens (kobolds, orcs, etc.) with the PCs, they do not know the exact nature of the trap. They do know that there are a lot of traps in this area — a fact they may or may not share with the PCs. Turag (Room A28), for instance, may decide to let the PCs walk into a trap without giving a warning.

**Hold Person Trap:** An affected target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. Trap resets after 1 minute.

**Burning Hands Trap:** 3d6 fire damage. Creatures take half damage on a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. Automatically resets after 1 round. Note: A PC paralyzed by the hold person trap cannot save against this fire damage.

> Several skeletons sit against the wall, the shackles that held them to their fate still on their wrists. A dead orc lies just beyond the trap, face down, his clothing singed and burned.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This Room was used as a torture chamber and its shackled inhabitants were left there to die. The orc died at the hands of the trap and no other orcs followed him in.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** The orc has a small pouch with six small stones. The stones are semi-magical, providing pure mana for spells. Each stone can substitute for any one magical component of any spell up to 3rd level. The orc also has a +1 dagger hidden in his boot.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the traps affect two PCs. To decrease the challenge of the encounter, give the orc a +1 shield as well.

## A99. Empty Vault

The door to this Room is closed.

> A couple of broken crates lay about this barren room. An empty barrel is tipped over and nestled inside a chipped groove in the stonework. A thin human sleeps against the southeast corner, wrapped in an old blanket. His eyes slowly open as you enter the room.

**Initial Attitude:** Varies

**Encounter:** This was a minor storage vault. Although it was once trapped, the trap has since failed, and the door is perfectly safe.

A human (Nylinn) hides from the creatures in this Section. He was part of a larger group of adventurers who were attacked and killed by orcs and kobolds. He was able to survive and make it to safety.

He was unable to lock the door behind himself, as the door was damaged. Nylinn is cold, tired, and suffering from a nasty, untreated wound in his back. He initially hides this from the PCs, believing they might choose to leave him behind if he can't take care of himself.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 6, Safe

**Tactics:** Depending on the GM's preferences and the needs of the game, Nylinn might be one of any number of people.

**Option 1:** Nylinn is a friendly NPC with the potential to become a PC. If so, he has no character class until a player takes him on. He doesn't know much about the dungeon and only came following rumors of treasure, though the fact other adventurers are searching for the gold or that the PCs' employers sent other people down here might set up some intriguing complications further down the line.

**Option 2:** Nylinn is a 4th-level rogue and a rival NPC adventurer. This does not make him an enemy of the PCs outright. Their goals may align. He was hired by the church to retrieve a lost book of rituals stolen by Longtail. He's made it this far into the dungeon because he is competent and quiet. He travels alone because it's easy to infiltrate that way. He is not aware that he is stuck in the dungeon, though, but he is aware of the various non-troglodyte factions in the Region. He does not know where Longtail is. He promises the PCs to stay out of their way and, if they seem amenable, offers information about Longtail (or something else of interest to the PCs) in exchange for healing. He might tell the PCs about the relationship between Longtail and Achsyyx or about the treasure in Room A97. He might prove a useful ally at some point later in the adventure if the PCs are struggling and the GM feels the need to help them out.

**Option 3:** Nylinn is a 3rd-level human warlock. The cat from Room A59 is his. He wants his familiar back if the PCs have it. This could lead to a fight. If the PCs do not have the cat, he may or may not ever bring up his familiar, presuming it is dead. He offers to accompany the PCs for a share of the profits, both for himself and for his cat. He is endearingly haughty and much less intelligent than he believes himself to be.

**Note:** The humanoids and lizardfolk know who Nylinn is. If you go this route, be prepared for the consequences.

Unless the GM chooses for Nylinn to be Longtail, no stats are provided. GMs are welcome to come up with other reasons for Nylinn being here.

**Treasure:** Nylinn's treasure varies, depending on which version of him the GM decides to include in the adventure.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, give Nylinn a wolf as an animal companion in addition to his cat familiar. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, Nylinn does not wake up when the PCs enter. However, this only matters if the PCs choose to fight him.

This scaling is strange. It requires some forethought on the GM's part. Before the encounter commences, the GM will have to determine how powerful the PCs are compared to Nylinn. If a wolf companion is present, that will have to be described. Even if the PCs do not intend to fight Nylinn, it will still be necessary to gauge relative strengths.
