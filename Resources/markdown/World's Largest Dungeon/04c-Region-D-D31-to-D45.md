# Region D (continued)

## D31. Foundries

A crucible hanging from an iron frame and filled with bubbling molten metal dominates this alcove. Beneath it burns a white-hot fire, fed by jets of gas from numerous holes set into the walls. All around this area are barrels containing water. Some derro climb a ladder leading up to the bowl and drop broken weapons, tools, chunks of ore, and on occasion, a squeaking rat into the molten mixture, while others dip smaller crucibles attached to long poles to withdraw a portion and pour it into the casts at the base.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This is where five derro smelt the raw metals into a liquid state and add enough adamantine to make it as strong as steel.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The formian warriors in Room D30 move to this area to tip the crucible and cover the floor with flaming metal. Tipping the crucible is simple, requiring a pull of a lever. The formians take positions on the ladders, using ranged attacks against the PCs. Near the water barrels is a stack of repeating light crossbows. At the first sign of trouble, each derro grabs one and moves to a position of cover, if any, before firing.

Pouring hot metal onto the floor causes the water barrels to burst, resulting in billows of steam. All creatures in this room gain concealment (20% miss chance) from the obscured vision. There is no way to tamper with the gas jets fueling the fire. PCs unlucky enough to find themselves in the inferno take 20d6 points of fire damage and automatically catch fire. To put themselves out, they must make a DC 15 Dexterity save.

**Treasure:** Though none of the derro have any personal treasure, they do possess ten 1-lb. bars of adamantine, each worth 50 gp.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the damage dealt by the liquid metal to 20d6. To decrease the challenge, do not allow the crucible to be tipped.

## D32-D51. Great Hall

This section is the central nervous system of the complex, comprised of Rooms D32-D51. This is an enormous cavern, over 200 ft. wide and with a ceiling towering 100 ft. overhead. Nine buildings dominate the center of the cavern. Several of these structures feature connecting ramps and tracks leading to other buildings and ultimately the track at Room D51. Three balconies overlook the workings, while the two major entrances feature more guards. Filling this vast gallery are stone giants, derro, xill and more, too numerous to count. In short, a direct confrontation is tantamount to suicide.

The massive bore dominates the Hall. Four stone giants push the handles to pull the truesilver out of the earth. The extracted truesilver climbs the helical thread with each turn, until it reaches the platform at the top. There, derro workers use force clamps to retrieve the ore and place it into large metal carts. A fifth stone giant pushes the cart to a conveyer carrying the metal to the separation room, where the slaves separate the ore from the rock before sending the truesilver on to the refinery. In this room, slaves heat the truesilver and form it into bars where they are loaded onto palettes. Stone giants carry the palettes to the wheeled carts, depositing them into the gnome's lab in Room D53. The slaves move the separated rock to Room D37, where an yrthak uses its sonic lance to pulverize it into gravel, so the dwarves can easily dump it in lava flow.

Chtrax uses the Great Hall as his command center, where he oversees operations in the mines, from discussing security issues with his myrmarch captain to inspecting the extraction process, to checking on the various excavation sites. In all, Chtrax keeps a close eye on his servants' progress, and he does so from this quasi-cockpit.

If the PCs fight any formians before entering this place, the entire cavern is put on alert because of the hive mind link between formians. Each room below details normal encounters and encounters when alert. In addition, each room also details what reinforcements, if any, arrive to aid their beleaguered allies. Even though many rooms list the number of formian warriors as they arrive in waves, there are only so many formian warriors. The Great Hall has 30 unattached formian warriors, 10 unattached elite formian warriors and 2 unattached formian taskmasters. Each time the PCs engage in a combat in one of the Great Hall's rooms, they undoubtedly draw more formians to their position as indicated in the room's description. The formian warrior reinforcements number 30. After all 30 formian warriors or formian taskmasters arrive or fall, no more arrive. You could move formian warriors from other encounter sites to engage the PCs, but those formians are under orders to protect their respective rooms. Regardless, the Great Hall resumes its normal activity after one hour lapses (unless the PCs kill or rout everyone).

Chtrax remains in the Great Hall from Day 0 until Day 3. Later, he moves to Room D58 after the tarrasque reaches the first adamantine bands. Thereafter he has a 10% chance to be in a random room in the Great Hall, a 50% chance of being in Room D78 and a 40% chance to be inspecting the mines in Rooms D78 to Room D80.

Destroying the myrmarch in Room D39 or the phylactery in Room D49 changes the dynamics of the section. If the PCs kill the myrmarch, formians in the Great Hall, the Approach, and the Old Mines suffer a -2 penalty to attacks, saves and skill checks and lose their hive mind ability. Destroying the phylactery, however, removes the hive mind ability from all the formians in the region, telling them their queen is dead. The formians stay in their respective locations attacking any non-formians encountered, including the giants, derro, slaves, xill and PCs. While in this enraged state, PCs cannot reason with them. All formians fight to the death.

Allow cautious PCs to move unmolested through this area if they do nothing to draw attention to themselves. There are plenty of places for the PCs to move, such as skirting the edge of the cavern, keeping out of range of the inhabitants' darkvision and if they avoid combat, they should be fine. Should the PCs make a direct assault, let them feel the full weight of Chtrax's power.

Buildings have masonry walls 1 ft. thick. Climbing these walls requires a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

The Great Hall has a sunken floor, but it is relatively level and free of debris. Unlike most of this section, purplish flames erupt from the floor, lighting the Great Hall. The flames are not hot but offer light equivalent in brightness to moonlight. Water extinguishes them for five minutes before drying enough to flare up again.

### Random Encounters

Roll for a Random Encounter once every thirty minutes.

| D20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1 | A malfunction occurs in the extraction-separation-refinement process, bringing the system to a halt. All workers stop and stand outside their locations, enjoying the short respite. Work continues in 1d3 hours, when formian workers correct the problem. |
| 2-4 | Tremors shake the corridor, causing fine streams of dust to spill from cracks in the ceiling. In addition, roll 1d20. A random structure suffers 100 points of damage: |
| | **Random Structure Table (D20):** |
| | 1-2: Room D33 |
| | 3: Room D34 |
| | 4: Room D35 |
| | 5-6: Room D37 |
| | 7: Room D38 |
| | 8: Room D39 |

| | 12-13: Room D42 |
| | 14: Room D46 |
| | 15: Room D47 |
| | 16-17: Room D48 and D49 |
| | 18-20: A major tremor functions as an earthquake. Each tremor carries a cumulative 10% chance for the entire cavern to collapse, burying the Great Hall under a mountain of rock. It takes 1d10 rounds for the ceiling to collapse completely, destroying all of the structures and dealing 20d6 points of damage to each of the structure's inhabitants. |
| 5-6 | Off-duty deep dwarf slaves gather around a cistern. |
| 7 | A derro handler and his bulette move from D47 to either D44 or D51. They attack the PCs on sight or call for help. |

## D32. Sentry

Guarding this wide staircase are two insect men and a large stone creature, its face chiseled into a cruel smile. Behind the guards is a vast cavern filled with several buildings and creatures, all working near a massive bore, drilling into the heart of the earth. Balconies overlook the cavern occupied by watchful guards manning ballistae. This is a fearsome place, filled with more opponents than even the bravest army could hope to overcome.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly or Hostile (if alerted)

**Encounter:** Guarding this entry are two formian warriors and a stone golem. The formian warriors vigilantly protect the Great Hall from intruders and are even suspicious of derro, with the recent raids from the renegades.

Getting past these sentries requires a successful DC 20 Charisma (Deception) check (DC 25 if alerted). Combat with these formians puts the Great Hall on alert.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the PCs fought the derro and formians in room D31, these guards are ready for them, positioning themselves on either side of the door and leaving the stone golem in the middle to block the passage into the hall. When the players engage the golem, the formian warriors take full attacks on the closest PCs.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the number of formian warriors by four. To decrease the challenge, remove the formian warriors.

---

## D33. Separation Room

This large building stands between a smaller connected building and a ramp descending from the platform housing the bore. With no windows and only a single door, the plumes of smoke rising from stacks on its roof make the structure more imposing.

If the PCs enter, read the following text:

Inside, a tracked ramp dumps nuggets of rock mixed with glowing metal into bins. Dwarven slaves move the full bins to worktables where other slaves use odd devices to handle the materials and separate the silvery metal from the bare rock. Once they separate the metal, they place the pure substance on a conveyor to carry it out of the room and into the attached building. Clouds of dust boil up from the tables, venting through the ceiling. Overseeing the entire operation is a large ant creature and a derro with a glazed expression at its side.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent or Hostile (if alert)

**Encounter:** A formian taskmaster oversees the separation of the truesilver from the rock. At his side is a dominated derro overseer. Working the room are 12 duergar and 20 deep dwarf slaves.

**Encounter Condition:** [Stagnant Air], Unhallowed

**Tactics:** If not alerted to intruders, the taskmaster scuttles over to the PCs inquiring of their business. To convince the formian they belong, they must succeed a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Intimidation) check. The taskmaster does not respond to Persuasion. If the Great Hall is alert, the formian alerts his fellow formians through the hive mind of the presence of intruders.

Combat with the formian taskmaster alerts the rest of the Great Hall. If alerted, in 1d6 rounds a patrol of 1d4 formian warriors arrives to aid the combatants against the heroes. More formians join the fight every 1d6 rounds thereafter until the threat is suitably contained. The reinforcements continue until 12 formian warriors have answered the call. Then, the formian myrmarch from Room D39 arrives to destroy any surviving PCs.

If the PCs or a tremor destroys this building, production stops for 1d6 days, as formian workers hasten to rebuild the structure. In the meantime, the formian myrmarchs confine the slaves to their quarters or the formians send the dwarves to work in other tunnels.

**Treasure:** There is a considerable fortune of truesilver in this room, but direct contact by a mortal turns it to normal silver. There are 75 pounds of the stuff scattered between the bins and the various tables, worth over 75,000 gp if the PCs can handle it without contaminating it. Otherwise, the silver is worth 375 gp.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, decrease the amount of time for reinforcements to just 1d3 rounds. To decrease the challenge, increase the amount of time for reinforcements to 2d6 rounds.

---

## D34. Refinery

Inside this smaller, attached and windowless building, slaves work to melt silver metal taken from a conveyor from the adjoining building. They then cast the metal into bars. When suitably cooled, the slaves load the bars onto low carts, for the stone giant to move to yet another structure. More insect men watch the slaves' progress with blank and unblinking stares. The room is replete with poisonous fumes.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent or Hostile (if alert)

**Encounter:** Once the slaves separate the ore from the rock in Room D33, they send it here on a conveyer belt, where ten deep dwarf slaves smelt the ore into liquid and cast it into bars, making it easy to transport for the gnome in Room D54. Six formian warriors are vigilant in the security here, keeping alert and watching for treachery. Two stone giant laborers load the palettes of bars onto carts and roll them to Room D42. This process is extremely slow and dangerous.

The fumes from the refining process are toxic. As the dwarves are extremely resistant to poison, and the formians immune, most are unaffected. PCs entering this room must succeed DC 15 Constitution saves or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage from the poisonous atmosphere. Ten rounds later, they must succeed a second save, regardless of the success or failure of the first, against the same DC, or take an additional 1d6 points of Constitution. This continues for every 10 rounds they remain in the room and for ten rounds after they leave.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the room is alerted, the formian warriors notify the other formians in the Great Hall to the presence of intruders. Otherwise, the formian warriors question the PCs about their presence. PCs must succeed a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check to convince the formian warriors they belong. On a failed check, the warriors ask the PCs to leave. On a failed check by 5 or more, the formians warn the other formians in the Great Hall of intruders and then attack.

The formians command the slaves to attack the PCs, though the slaves only fight until half their number fall before fleeing. The stone giants hurl carts at the PCs, dealing damage as boulders. They have enough for two carts apiece. Finally, the formian warriors move to gain flanks against the PCs.

Combat tips off the rest of the Great Hall. If alerted, a patrol of 1d4 formian warriors arrives in 1d6 rounds to aid the combatants against the heroes. The reinforcements continue until a total of 12 formian warriors answer the call, and then the formian myrmarch from Room D39 arrives to destroy any surviving PCs.

If the PCs or a tremor destroys this building, refinement moves to the factory at Room D30. If the PCs destroyed the factory there, production stops altogether for 2d6 days until the formian workers can rebuild the structure. In the meantime, the formian myrmarchs confine the slaves to their quarters or send dwarves to work in other tunnels.

**Treasure:** There are 50 pounds of truesilver in bars and in raw form in this Room. The haul is worth over 37,500 gp if the PCs can handle them without contamination. Otherwise, the silver is worth 250 gp.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, decrease the amount of time for reinforcements to just 1d3 rounds. To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of stone giants by 1 and increase the amount of time for reinforcements to 2d6 rounds.

---

## D35. Tracked Ramp

Large cans filled with rock travel down the tracked ramp descending from the large platform to end inside of an adjacent building.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** An ore cart travels down the ramp once per five minutes from Room D39. The ramp itself is unguarded. Walking on this ramp reduces a PCs speed by half and requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to keep one's footing. A failed check indicates the PC falls on the ramp. A failed check by 5 or more indicates the PC fell to the floor below, taking 8d6 points of falling damage.

The ore carts are unavoidable, taking up the whole of the ramp. PCs struck by a cart take 2d6 points of damage and tumble down the ramp into a bin in Room D33.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The ramp has 40 hit points and a damage threshold of 10. If the PCs or tremors destroy the ramp, slaves unload the rock from the threads of the bore at Room D40 and load it into carts and the giants push the carts to Room D33. It takes the formian workers 1d3 days to rebuild this ramp.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

---

## D36. Track

Two stone giants push a cart along this track. With each movement, the contents splash and run down its sides. The track originates at an angled building and ends at the drill site.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** Two stone giants haul grease to the drill site. The giants ignore PCs unless they attack or if a formian taskmaster commands the giants to attack the PCs. If the Great Hall is alert, the giants continue their business.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** PCs improving the giants' attitude to Friendly or better, which requires a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, convince the giants to divulge what they know about the Great Hall. The giants know the basic operations in the hall but are unfamiliar with anything beyond that. They do know formians take injured derro to the Infirmary at Room D48. Most derro return, but all notice they return changed.

If drawn into a fight, the giants are ruthless, having lived under the oppressive rule of first the derro and then the xill. They use the opportunity to vent their frustration, by hurling a cart at the PCs, dealing damage as a thrown rock, before they close with slam attacks.

Combat here instantly alerts formians warriors, who in turn alert the rest of the hall. Every 1d4 rounds, 1d6 formian warriors arrive, continuing until 18 formian warriors have arrived. In addition, the derro sentries at Room D45 fire ballista bolts at the PCs for as long as they can see them. After six rounds of fighting, the formian myrmarch from Room D39 arrives to dispatch the remaining intruders.

If the PCs or tremors destroy this track, slaves carry tubs of grease until the formian workers repair the track in 1d3 days.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, decrease the amount of time for reinforcements to arrive to just 1d2 rounds. To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of stone giants by 1 and increase the amount of time for reinforcements to 1d8 rounds.

---

## D37. Gravel and Rendering Shop

This angled building is nondescript, featuring two entrances. The first is a wide bay, large enough to allow the giant exiting to pass without ducking. The second is a smaller wooden door. The air here stinks of rock dust, mixed with the stench of a charnel house.

Once inside, read the following:

Inside, the twin purposes of this building become abundantly clear. First, a chained, large, winged reptile and two blind bipedal creatures with cone-like mouths shatter rock with a magical sonic ability. Derro overseers watch the progress, while dwarf slaves drag more large boulders into the path of the blasting. Clouds of grey dust swirl into the air. It is fair to say the noise is deafening.

The second function of the room is less mundane. Corpses of slaves, derro and even giants sit in a pile while a weird dinosaur creature hoses them with a stream of liquid. Where the fluid falls, the flesh breaks down and streams of acrid smoke rise. Four masked slaves push the runoff into troughs to carry the fluids into a sunken vat. There three more slaves stir the mixture with long poles. Occasionally, one dips a bucket into the stinking pool to pull forth a fresh batch of lubricant.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** This building serves to break down rock and flesh. The chained creature is an yrthak and the others are destrachan. Two derro handlers watch their progress, and 4 deep dwarves shovel the gravel into carts to be dragged away at a later time to Room D7. The derro and the dwarves are deaf from the noise.

On the other side is a digester and his handler. The slaves are all deep dwarves. These slaves make lubricants for drilling from liquefied carcasses.

If the PCs enter this room, the derro are suspicious but ignore them. As this room lacks a formian presence, even if the Great Hall is under direct assault, the derro handlers have no way of knowing about it without going outside, something they only do at shift changes. Consequently, all of the creatures here ignore the PCs.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The derro are not interested in conversing with PCs. Any questions about the complex, its operation or leadership tell the derro the PCs are outsiders. Should a fight break out the derro fall back and command the others to attack.

**Round 1:** Derro handlers fall back and fire crossbow bolts at the PCs. The digester uses its acid spray in a cone effect. The destrachan move to catch the PCs in crossfire of destructive harmonics while the yrthak uses its sonic lance on the chain holding it. The slaves flee.

**Round 2:** Derro handlers fire another barrage of poisoned crossbow bolts or use psychic thunderwave on groups of PCs. The digester charges the nearest living creature, ally or enemy, and attacks using its claws until its acid recharges. The destrachan use their destructive harmonics again if losing, or if they have the upper hand, switch to the nerves effect. The yrthak wings out through the wide door and takes to the air, launching sonic lance attacks at the various buildings and individuals in the Great Hall. The slaves flee to room D42.

**Round 3:** If the combat goes against the derro and their minions, they create darkness and flee, leaving the combat to their remaining minions. Otherwise, the derro alternate between thunderwave and poisoned bolts. Surviving destrachan continue with their destructive harmonics. The digester continues its attack.

**Following Rounds:** If the yrthak escaped, it wreaks havoc in the Great Hall, using its sonic attacks to destroy structures and villains alike. In response to those attacks, the ballistae at Room D43 and Room D45 launch attacks at the winged reptile. Formian workers scramble to repair damaged structures and 2d12 formian warriors and a formian myrmarch move to Room D37 to eliminate the PCs on round 6. The rest of the Great Hall is alert until the formians destroy the yrthak and the PCs.

If the PCs or tremors destroy the gravel and rendering house, the formians force the slaves to carry the larger rocks directly to the lava. For lubrication, they simply slaughter slaves at the drill site and dump the bodies near the bore. This is not effective, but the derro do not care. It takes the formian workers 2d3 days to rebuild this structure.

**Treasure:** One of the derro handlers has an iron key. The key unlocks the gate to Room D47.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a formian taskmaster to this Room and have it control the digester. To decrease the challenge, remove the yrthak.

---

## D38. Cistern

A 40 ft. tank, nearly 30 ft. in diameter, stands in the center of the chamber. Guarding it are five insect men and a crippled derro, who fills cups with water drawn from the massive container. The floor around the cistern is muddy.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This reservoir holds fresh water. Six formian warriors stand guard, while a crippled derro rations out the water to dusty workers. The formians pay little attention to the humanoid, being watchful of trespassers or idle workers. Four formians stand evenly spaced, guarding each cardinal point. The other two flank the derro.

Mylthran, the crippled derro, on the other hand, despises his lot, the formians and the xill controlling the entire region. In fact, his hatred is so fierce he despises even his own people, seeing them only as traitors. Several weeks ago, he broke his leg in a cave-in. He refused treatment in the infirmary and managed to set the bone himself. Somehow, he was not condemned to the rendering house, and instead forced to work the cistern.

Since taking his new post, he has secretly poisoned the well, adding more and more toxins with the intention of murdering the region's population. What has happened instead is most of the inhabitants have resisted the poison and grown immune to it. Those that have not are easier to paralyze and thereby easier to inject with eggs. Now the well is extremely toxic and anyone who has not been acclimated to it must succeed a DC 15 Constitution save or take 5d6 poison damage and have their maximum hit points reduced by the same amount until the end of their next long rest. Ten rounds later, regardless of whether they made the initial save or not, the victim must succeed another save against the same DC, or the poison deals an addition 5d6 poison damage, reducing the maximum hit points in the same way.

**Encounter Condition:** Poor Footing 4

**Tactics:** The formian warriors do not wait for discussion before attacking. A myrmarch ordered them to protect the cistern at all costs, as it is the only fresh water supply in the region. Hence, if the PCs approach and the formian warriors notice them, they attack first, alert the rest of the hall to the threat if it is not already aware, and call for reinforcements.

Mylthran runs as fast as he can to Room D32, where he believes he can make a quick escape.

If the PCs or tremors destroy the cistern, the entire operation is in jeopardy with no water, and the inhabitants dehydrate. There is a supply of water in Rooms D72 and D75 but Chtrax does not divert labor to acquire it. Instead, he doubles and triples the shifts, intent on finding the vault before his labor force perishes. Should this take place, escalate the tarrasque's timeline as detailed in the Introduction by two days, meaning the devils escape on Day 5 instead of Day 7.

PCs without water can survive for 1 day plus the number of hours equal to their Constitution scores. On the third day after the cistern's destruction, all slaves take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. On the fourth day, they take another 3 (1d6) points of nonlethal damage. This continues until the tarrasque breaks through to the devil vault.

**Treasure:** Mylthran carries 6 doses of dark reaver powder (300 gp each).

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a normal stone golem. To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of formian warriors by 2.

---

## D39. Bore

A giant drill descends into the earth. Sprouting from it are four large iron bars, pushed by four stone giants. The drill threads carry chunks of rock upward to the platform overhead. The rock surrounding the drill head is slippery with lubricant and smokes with a foul odor. Overseeing the bore's progress is an enormous insect creature and four small insect warriors.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Four stone giants push the handles of an enormous bore. As they rotate it, chunks of truesilver emerge near the cavity. Shifts change in 8 hours, effectively doubling the stone giants here for 1 minute.

Watching their progress is the formian myrmarch in charge of truesilver extraction and refinement. He keeps eight formian warriors nearby to ensure security. Aside from overseeing the drilling process, he is aware of disruptions in the Great Hall and commands his formian warriors through the hive mind to deal with disruptions. In addition, he is also responsible for repairing structures and so oversees the formian workers in Room D46.

The formian warriors are watchful for slackers and intruders and actively make Wisdom (Perception) checks. Each round the PCs remain within line of sight with the bore, allow the formian warriors there to make Wisdom (Perception) checks. If they see the PCs, they immediately report the information to the myrmarch, who in turn alerts the rest of the hall to the presence of intruders.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The myrmarch has his orders – destroy all intruders. Leading his warriors, he sends out a mental alert to all the formians in the complex and attacks the PCs. Each round 1d3 additional formian warriors arrive to help their master, until 18 formians arrive. The giants continue to turn the bore but will defend themselves if attacked. The derro ballistae crews at Rooms D43 and D45 target PCs they can see.

Killing the myrmarch removes the formians' hive mind ability and imposes disadvantage to all of their attacks, saves and skill checks.

If the PCs, tremors, or the destruction of the platform above collapses and destroys the bore, truesilver extraction stops, lacking the materials to construct another one. Fortunately, Chtrax has enough truesilver for the gnome to make the collar for the Pit Fiend. With the extraction processes halted, Chtrax leaves this section to oversee the digging at Room D61 or with the gnome in Room D63, with a 50% chance of each. The formians divert the slaves and derro to various tunnels throughout the complex to aid in the digging efforts. Thereafter, only a token force remains in this chamber; halve the number of all creatures encountered in this section.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add 30 hit points to the myrmarch. To decrease the challenge, increase the time it takes reinforcements to arrive to 1d6 rounds and remove one of the stone giants.

---

## D40. Platform

Framing the great drill are four huge metal poles, easily 5 ft. thick. Atop of the poles, 80 ft. high, stands a platform. From one side descends a ramp. Two ladders, on the opposite sides offer access to the top.

**Initial Attitude:** Indifferent

**Encounter:** Working atop the platform are six formian workers who use force clamps to move the rock from the helical thread to the iron carts. Two stone giants push the carts onto the tracked ramp, Room D35, to travel down to Room D33. These creatures are oblivious to combat and do nothing to aid those below, focused obsessively on their work.

**Encounter Condition:** Tremors 18

**Tactics:** These creatures do not initiate combat, nor do they converse with PCs. If attacked, however, the stone giants fight back. The formian workers flee, scuttling down the ladders as quickly as they can. The stone giants hurl chunks of rock as they come up the thread until the PCs close to melee combat. Then, the giants make bull rush attacks to knock them from the platform. The ballistae at Room D43 and Room D45 have a clear line of sight to the platform and direct their attacks there if combat breaks out, unconcerned if they happen to hit a stone giant or formian. If the PCs reduce the giants to 10 hit points or less, they surrender.

A fall from the platform deals 24 (8d6) points of damage.

If the platform is destroyed, the bore falls to the floor in a random direction. With the platform, the ramp at Room D35 falls as well. To see the falling drills' direction, roll 1d20 and consult the table below.

### Falling Bore Direction Table

| D20 | Result |
|:---:|:-------|
| 1-3 | Falls on Room D47 and collapses the building. All creatures within take 3d6 points of damage and the monsters go on a killing spree, heading in random directions, attacking as many creatures as possible |
| 4-7 | Falls to the floor, creating a tremor as if you had rolled 2-4 on the Random Encounter Table for this section. |
| 8-10 | Falls to the floor, creating a tremor as if you had rolled 2-4 on the Random Encounter Table for this section. In addition, it lands on the track between Rooms D34 and D41, halting the transport of truesilver. |
| 11-13 | Falls on Room D33 and collapses the building. All creatures inside take 3d6 points of damage. |
| 14-16 | Falls on Room D37 and collapses the building. All creatures inside take 3d6 points of damage. In addition, the surviving monsters go on a killing spree, wreaking havoc throughout the section. |
| 17-19 | Falls on Room D38, destroying the cistern, killing the formian warriors and the crippled derro. |
| 20 | Falls on Room D46, killing all inhabitants. Destruction of this magnitude shuts down the entire operation as described in Room D39. |

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, make the platform unstable, requiring the PCs to succeed at a DC 15 Dexterity check to keep their footing. If they fail by 5 or more, they fall to the ground 80 ft below. In addition, add two more formian workers, so they can heal one of the stone giants. To decrease the challenge, remove one of the stone giants.

## D41. Transportation and Inventory

A cart track runs into this building from one side and out another. A stone giant wheels the cart into the building and then walks up the track. Outside of the building stand three insect warriors.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Three elite formian warriors guard this room. Their orders are to ensure no one tampers with arriving or departing ore carts. These creatures are watchful, so allow them to make Wisdom (Perception) checks against any creatures in line of sight.

Inside a formian taskmaster and its destrachan servant inventory the truesilver bars going to the gnome. He submits a weekly report to the formian myrmarch, who in turn reports to Chtrax to show their progress.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The formian warriors generally ignore anyone moving past this room, only attacking anyone not of the Great Hall and approaching this room. When attacking, they do not move more than 10 ft. away from the room, falling back should PCs attempt to lure them away. Combat with these formians alerts the rest of the Great Hall to the intruders. On the following round, the formian taskmaster exits the room, commanding the destrachan to attack, while it enters melee. At the beginning of each round of combat, 1d4 formian warriors arrive until 12 show up. Then, the formian myrmarch from Room D39 comes to dispatch any surviving PCs.

If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, business continues as normal; a formian taskmaster goes to Room D34 to count.

**Treasure:** At any given time, there are 2d20 1-lb. bars of truesilver. Each bar is worth 750 gp. Recall, if any creature touches the bar, the bar becomes standard silver, worth about 5 gp.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, double the number of elite formian warriors. To decrease the challenge, remove the resistances and immunities from the destrachan.

## D42. Barracks

Ramshackle cots fill this large building. Cobwebs cling to corners and the floor is filthy with dust, hair and dirt. Otherwise, the room is empty.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This large building is not much more than a warehouse filled with beds, its rear wall exposed rock. Once, the derro slept here, but now it is always empty as the derro sleep in or around their work areas.

**Encounter Condition:** [Safe]

**Tactics:** This is a good place for the PCs to rest as no one ever comes here anymore. Only roll for Random Encounters once per day at this location.

If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, no one notices.

**Treasure:** PCs searching under the cots and succeeding a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check find a secret compartment concealed by years of grime. The compartment is locked, its key long lost, requiring a successful DC 25 Dexterity check to open. Alternatively, a PC succeeding a DC 20 Strength check can break it open. Inside are the following items: six cut sapphires (1,000 gp each), a small charcoal diagram of a repeating ballista (100 gp), an obsidian bracelet with three small spheres each etched with a decorative rune (140 gp), a perfect cylinder made of cherry wood (800 gp), a smooth slate ring (500 gp), a doll made of human skin (no value), +2 dagger, ring of water walking, and a pearl of power. Souiji's daughter, a consummate thief, left this hidden cache. She intended to return for her things, but a xill egg killed her before she could.

**Scaling:** N/A

## D43. Guard Balcony

A dark staircase carved into the rock winds upward, presumably to the balcony 80 ft. above the Great Hall. From below, you can see a mounted large ballista and derro leaning over the rail to watch those below.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** Three derro sentries guard the Great Hall. One mans the repeating ballista (see below) mounted on a swivel base. The other two carry heavy repeating crossbows. As they keep an eye out for trouble, they use the repeating ballista against any foes combating the inhabitants of the Great Hall. With their height advantage along with the dim lighting in the Hall, the derro have a good view of the entire complex.

**Repeating Ballista:** 3d8/19-20; range 120 ft.; crew 1; cost 1,000 gp

Unlike normal ballistae, the repeating ballista may fire up to six projectiles before needing a new cartridge. The crew makes a ranged attack with this weapon, but at disadvantage for size. It takes 3 rounds to reload this weapon, 2 rounds if two people work together.

There are five cartridges total for the ballista.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the derro sentries spot combat in the Great Hall, they use the repeating ballista and heavy crossbow attacks against the PCs. If the PCs come up the access tunnel, the three derro ready actions to fire their heavy repeating crossbows against any intruders coming up the stairs behind them. These derro are infected and fight to the death.

If the PCs or tremors destroy this room, the balcony and its survivors fall to the ground, destroying both the ballista and the sentries. The formian workers repair the balcony in 1d2 days.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a second ballista and have each deal an addition 2d6 fire damage to each hit. To decrease the challenge, double the reload time.

## D44. East Sentry

Three steps lead up to this exit. At the top, a single sentry defends it. It resembles a giant derro, except it is made of granite. Blood stains and shattered bones cover the floor below.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** The stone golem guards this exit and is under orders to attack any creature not accompanied by a formian or derro. Hence, the golem has killed many slaves trying to get back to work in the mines. The golem attacks the PCs as soon as they either attack it or come within 20 ft.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** The golem closes with the PCs and uses its slow attack. On the following rounds, it uses full attack actions as much as possible. This golem fights until destroyed. Combat with this sentry is common, so 1d6 formian warriors only come to investigate 50% of the time. If the warriors do come to the fight, they alert the rest of the Great Hall, and 1d4 more formian warriors arrive every 1d6 rounds until a total of 12 formian warriors are on site. Thereafter, no one else in the hall comes to investigate.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, give this stone golem an additional 40 hit points. To decrease the challenge, reduce the chance of reinforcements to 25%.

## D45. Guard Platform

A dark staircase carved into the rock winds upward, presumably to the balcony 80 ft. above the Great Hall. From below, you see a ballista extending over the railing. At ground level, there is a dark tunnel leading to some steps.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** The derro sentries that once manned this ballista have succumbed to the xill eggs. Now, three xill occupy this room, feasting on the remains of their former hosts. They are uninterested in the developments in the great hall, but if the PCs, or any other creature approach within 20 ft. of this room, allow the xill Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice. If they catch sight of the intruders, one creeps forward to the repeating ballista and takes aim, while the other two outsiders move silently down the stairs.

**Repeating Ballista:** 3d8/19-20; range 120 ft.; crew 1; cost 1,000 gp.

Unlike normal ballistae, the repeating ballista may fire up to six projectiles before needing a new cartridge. The crew makes a ranged attack with this weapon, but at disadvantage for size. It takes 3 rounds to reload this weapon, 2 if two people work together.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Once in position, the xill on the balcony fires, hoping to herd the PCs into the darkened tunnel where the xill's comrades wait. PCs scaling the wall or flying reach the balcony 80 ft. up, while the xill targets PCs still on the ground. Once any PCs reach the balcony, the xill retreats to the tunnel entrance, where he fights to the death or until his allies come up from below. Meanwhile, the xill in the tunnel "ready an action" to attack the first PC entering the tunnel. One focuses on grappling and injects an egg into the subject, while the other joins the grapple. If more PCs approach, one xill struggles to inject an egg in the first victim, while the second withdraws from the grapple to defend its ally. These creatures fight to the death.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, remove the disadvantage from the ballista and give each xill the Sneak Attack feature (2d6). To decrease the challenge, remove one xill.
