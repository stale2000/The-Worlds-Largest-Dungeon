## D61. THE DOOM OF THE DERRO

Amidst clouds of dust and rock ploughs the greatest terror in the entire world. Great chunks of stone collapse and pull away from the walls as the tarrasque digs and digs. Standing behind the creature is a robed derro, whose focused expression belies his madness. The sound of the monsters digging is awesome to be sure. After a moment, the derro turns, as if somehow aware, and looks at you, a smile blooming on his face.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
This encounter is both deadly to the PCs and instrumental to defeating Chtrax and his terrible plan. Excavating this tunnel is the tarrasque, controlled by its mad master Rroliq. Through a well-worded wish, cast years before Chtrax ever arrived, Rroliq gained control over this monster, but only as long as it remained within 5 ft. If he ever leaves the monster, the tarrasque breaks free. Each round that Rroliq is more than 5 ft. from the tarrasque there is a cumulative 5% chance the tarrasque breaks free. If the PCs kill Rroliq, the tarrasque automatically breaks free and goes on a killing rampage. Chtrax, when he dispatched the savants, dared not touch Rroliq, lest the tarrasque destroy him. Instead, he allied with the savant, exploiting him for his powers over this monstrosity.

When the PCs approach this area, Rroliq starts casting offensive spells. He does not send the tarrasque after them, fully confident in his own abilities. PCs naturally want to defend themselves and may strike back against the derro. If they kill him, they have bigger problems on their hands.

Letting the tarrasque go wild is the surest way to defeat Chtrax, short of killing the xill. However, PCs ought to get clear as quickly as they can and avoid confrontation with this monster. If they are foolish enough to fight the tarrasque, let them die.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
Rroliq casts spells with little regard for his own safety. First, he casts a fireball and takes a step towards the PCs. He repeats this tactic again on the following round, before falling back to lower-level offensive spells, saving a finger of death for something spectacular. Rroliq does not care if he dies, knowing the tarrasque will avenge him. If the PCs flee, Rroliq does not pursue.

Area of effect spells, like fireball, have additional effects in this tunnel, creating an earthquake on the ceiling directly above the area of effect.

As long as the savant lives, the tarrasque digs, ignoring the events around it. However, the savant's death releases the tarrasque, giving it free reign to kill and destroy all it can. The tarrasque attacks the nearest creatures, snapping up unfortunate victims with its bite attack and swallowing them whole.

Thereafter the monster follows, moves, kills, and destroys all it can moving along the following path: Room D58, Room D57, Room D52, spends several rounds leveling the Great Hall (this triggers cave-ins each round), and then moves toward Room D32 and beyond, widening the passage as necessary. If not stopped, the tarrasque moves out of the region, entering the lava flow from Room D2 to entering another region, laying waste to the dungeon, unless the denizens somehow rally and stop the monster. It continues its rampage for 1d2 weeks before finding a new place to sleep.

The surviving formians, if still under the control of their respective myrmarch and the phylactery is intact, rally to fight this monster, doing what they can to slow its movements. All surviving formian in the respective sections move to stop this monster's progress. The derro use destrachan, bulette and any other creatures at their disposal to fight as well. The slaves, however, use this opportunity to flee, moving away from the tarrasque's path and hiding in tunnels or the ruins of Room D7.

Chtrax has no interest in dying at the tarrasque's mercy, and flees to the Western Mines, away from the path of destruction. There he bides his time, plotting to break into the vault some other way. However, it is likely the tarrasque destroys the entire operation, setting back Chtrax's plans for years if not decades. If he knows the PCs are responsible, they have certainly earned his wrath for years to come.

On the other hand, if the PCs leave the monster alone, the tarrasque punches through the final barrier on Day 7, releasing the devils imprisoned in the vault. Rroliq dies immediately and a spectacular fight ensues between the devils and the tarrasque. PCs would do best to get away quickly and explore some other region in this dungeon. You can play through the combat, perhaps even letting the PCs control the tarrasque, formians, or even the hordes of shrieking fiends finally released after thousands of years of imprisonment. This could be a massive multi-night conflict, extending beyond the borders of this region, or simply a highlight, where you describe the events in cinematic detail. If you choose the latter, allow the devils to defeat the tarrasque after 20 rounds of combat before moving on to conquer the rest of this region. For more information on the devils, their numbers, tactics and goals, consult the Vault, Rooms D81 through D84.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the tarrasque enrage as soon as the PCs attack the derro. To decrease the challenge, have the tunnel cave in once the tarrasque breaks free, requiring it to take 6 rounds to pull itself free from the rubble.

## D62. SOUNDERS

At the far end of this massive tunnel hums a six-wheeled wagon carrying a metal cylindrical tank mounted in an iron cradle, with connecting hoses running to another reservoir. At the tank's rear is a deep dwarf who manipulates several levers, while towards the front another dwarf holds a cone of sorts and presses the narrow end to the wall. Beyond the odd machine are two narrow tunnels. The sound of hammering is undeniable.

### Initial Attitude
Unfriendly

### Encounter
A sounder crew, consisting of two deep dwarves, tests the walls with harmonic resonances here to see if they are any closer to the Vault. Six duergar and a grimlock overseer work in each of the narrow tunnels. The sounder crew, if left alone, turns on the device, to a narrow beam, high pulse with results as described in Room D53, likely arcing and killing one of the workers. If the PCs approach, the sounder crew alerts the grimlocks in the side tunnels, who lead the slaves to attack.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
The PCs can negotiate with the sounder crew, but a failed Charisma (Persuasion) check results as above. If the PCs improve their attitude, the deep dwarves urge them to leave. They know nothing of the Chtrax's plans, although they can explain how sounders work.

Combat is straightforward. The grimlocks lead the van, charging into the largest body of the PCs. If the grimlock overseers fall, the slaves surrender. All the duergar slaves carry xill eggs inside them.

If the tarrasque breaks free, the duergar turn on their grimlock overseers, possibly hatching the xill eggs should the grimlocks hit or kill any of these slaves. The deep dwarves flee to the Great Hall.

## D63. SLAVES

Digging through the rock is a team of slaves, led by a grimlock, alongside a large, armored horror. Sharp rocks, dust and bones litter the area. They seem focused on their task.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
A crew of duergar slaves, propelled by the lash of the grimlock overseer's whip, slowly digs through the dense rock. Working in the narrow tunnel is a bulette and its derro handler. The handler and half of the slaves carry xill eggs inside them. At first sight of the PCs, the grimlock sends one of the slaves to fetch the handler and its beast, before it commands the slaves to attack.

### Encounter Condition
Stagnant Air

### Tactics
As long as the derro handler and the grimlock foreman live, the slaves fight the PCs, fearful as they are of their masters. The duergar enlarge and circle the PCs, moving to gain flanks against the spellcasters, while the bulette barrels into the warriors. The grimlock aids the bulette's handler with their creature. If both of the leaders fall, the duergar flee to Room D58 to gain the myrmarch's protection. If the PCs already dispatched the myrmarch, the slaves flee to the Great Hall and out of the region if possible.

If the tarrasque breaks free in Room D61, the grimlock and the derro handler lead the bulette and the duergar to help stop the monster from destroying the whole complex.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, make all of the humanoids infected. To decrease the challenge, remove the duergar slaves and foreman.

## D64. TARRASQUE NEST

This deep tunnel is a stinking morass of dung, rotting carcasses and cast off equipment parts. The stench is unbearable. Great rents in the floor of this cave speak of some enormous, clawed inhabitant.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This is where the tarrasque retires after a long day of work. Filthy and disease-ridden rotting body parts, mostly dwarven arms and heads, lie scattered throughout. PCs exploring this area are at risk of contracting filth fever.

### Treasure
A search through this area turns up some incidental items left by the tarrasque's victims. Lodged into the rock is a large jacinth worth 5,000 gp, a star ruby worth 1,400 gp, an emerald worth 1,000 gp, and four pieces of tourmaline worth 400 gp each. Scattered throughout the tunnel, created by the tarrasque's friction, as it scratches against the tunnel, are 23 various-sized chunks of obsidian, each worth 30 gp each. Beneath one partly intact corpse of a derro savant (DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check) is a fully charged wand of greater healing (action to use, 5 charges, 1 charge has the effect of cure wounds, 2 charges for a mass cure wounds).

## D65. SENTRIES

Two insect men stand guard at this intersection, ready for anything.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
Two formian warriors watch over the slaves in the tunnels behind them.

### Encounter Condition
Echoes 4

### Tactics
These monsters immediately alert the rest of the formians in this section and attack any creature they encounter not a derro, dwarf, formian or xill. They do not negotiate, and they fight to the death. No one in the connecting tunnels comes to help these formians.

If the tarrasque breaks free in Room D61, these formian warriors move to Room D58 to help defend the rest of the region.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase each warrior's hit points by +20. To decrease the challenge, remove the sentries.

## D66. DIGGERS

The narrow tunnel opens into a small cave, where dwarves slowly chip away at the rock. Standing over them and gauging their progress is a blind humanoid with a drawn whip.

### Initial Attitude
Unfriendly

### Encounter
A crew of slaves and a grimlock mine this tunnel. They attack any PCs intruding on their tunnel unless the PCs succeed a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Intimidation) check. Otherwise, the duergar attack the PCs, using their tools as weapons.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
The grimlock knows nothing more detailed than the basic organization of the crews and teams working in this area. He also knows about the tarrasque at Room D61. The duergar, if allowed to speak, know a little, having heard rumors from their fellow slaves. They think the xill master is close to reaching some hidden treasure, and they mutually fear the outcome of his finding.

If combat breaks out, the duergar enlarge and charge, while the grimlock switches to his battleaxe. If combat goes against the slaves and their master, the surviving duergar use invisibility to flee.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, worsen the Initial Attitude to Hostile and give each grimlock foreman the fighter's Action Surge ability (single use). To decrease the challenge, improve the Initial Attitude to Indifferent.

## D67. MINE

More slaves and an overseer work this tunnel. In an adjoining cave is a weird mechanical device manned by two deep dwarf slaves, connecting the machine's odd cone apparatus to the wall. All focus on their labor.

### Initial Attitude
Unfriendly

### Encounter
A team of six duergar slaves and a grimlock overseer are mining this tunnel. The device in the cave is a sounder (see Room D58), manned by two deep dwarf slaves. When the PCs approach, the deep dwarves turn on the sounder using a mid-pulse. Allow the grimlock to make a Wisdom (Perception) check opposed by the PCs Dexterity (Stealth) check. If he notices the PCs, he takes no obvious action and waits to "see" using his blind sight ability to figure out where they go. If the PCs leave, he ignores them; if they position themselves for an attack, he commands the duergar to the ready.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
Should combat occur, the grimlock commands his duergar to vanish, and the duergar use their innate invisibility ability to disappear, attacking only when a PC happens to walk by them. The grimlock retreats to the sounders position and commands the deep dwarves to fire a high-level pulse as soon as the PCs close. These opponents are uninterested in talking and fight to the death.

### Treasure
The deep dwarves have an intact and operational sounder.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, give each of the duergar slaves the rogue Sneak Attack ability (2d6). To decrease the challenge, remove the sounder and deep dwarves.

## D68. ABANDONED TUNNELS

This tunnel steeply descends deeper into the earth. Algae and luminescent fungus line the walls, fed by water droplets beading on the rock's surface. After 30 ft., the tunnel ends at a staircase spiraling down into a great black void. The scent of moisture is undeniable.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Where this tunnel goes off the map, it leads to an underground lake filled with horror. The exact details of this site are up to you. The lake could be a flooded derro city, inhabited now by a powerful aboleth lord and his skum slaves. Alternatively, it could lead to more tunnels, with more derro miners working to uncover the vault. In any case, these details are up to the GM, and for those not wishing to expand the dungeon beyond this point, simply remove this tunnel from your map.

## D69-D75. WESTERN MINES

The Western Mines encompass Rooms D69 through D75. These tunnels are all new and recently excavated in just the last few weeks. Unlike other sections in this region, there is no single center of activity; the tunnels are still in the exploratory stages, resulting in small groups of expert miners as opposed to massive networks of miners.

Chtrax commanded his forerunners to explore this section, lay track in the tunnels, and excavate the area entirely, but a large section collapsed, killing more than thirty miners, in room D69. Worse, a few of the deeper probes to the north, beyond Rooms D72 and D75, released a flood of water, killing even more slaves and formians. Along with some unusual properties throughout these tunnels, progress has slowed, with many of the miners replaced by xill.

A single stone giant works the rails leading from Room D44 throughout these tunnels. He goes to the various digging sites, loads the rock, and takes the rock to Room D77, where the delver dissolves the rubble. The stone giant has no interest in fighting and flees in the face of well-armed PCs. He does not interact at all and only fights if prevented from fleeing.

All of the tunnels here are at least 10 ft. tall, extending to heights equal to the widths in larger tunnels and rooms. The floors are treacherous, prohibiting charges and run actions. PCs moving more than half speed must succeed a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone. All tunnels and rooms are dark unless otherwise specified in the rooms' descriptions.

On Day 0 through Day 3, Chtrax sends his minions to explore these tunnels and to excavate the rooms to find the Vault. After Day 3, however, he focuses on Room D61 and the tarrasque's progress through the adamantine bands. Consequently, the supplies, guards and materials move to other areas in the region, leaving this area virtually abandoned.

If the PCs have not yet stopped the tarrasque in Room D61 and are exploring this region after Day 3, treat all rooms featuring mining teams, the rooms with deep dwarves, duergar, grimlocks, and or derro, as empty.

### Random Encounters

During Day 0 through Day 3, check for Random Encounters once every two hours the PCs explore this section. From Day 4 or later, roll for Random Encounters once per day.

## D69. CAVED-IN ROOM

PCs moving down the tunnel to Room D77 and, succeeding a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, hear the following:

From the wall, you hear a faint scratching noise. You strain to listen, and think you hear cries for help. Trinkets, stone carvings and the like lie scattered on the floor near the base of a pile of loose rock.

### Initial Attitude
Friendly

### Encounter
An earthquake caved-in a large portion of the tunnels, trapping and killing many of Chtrax's workers. Still alive and trapped inside this cave are 4 duergar and 6 deep dwarf slaves who hammer at the walls for help. The sounds echo eerily throughout the tunnels outside. The duergar slaves joke about the sounds, but the deep dwarves leave offerings and secretly work at the walls to free their trapped comrades, when no one watches.

The slaves inside are half-starved, bruised and beaten. They lack the strength to dig themselves out and will succumb to the ravages of hunger and thirst by Day 5. The PCs can clear the rock and debris where the wall is narrowest. A PC may roll a DC 25 Intelligence check to find the narrowest wall. In one minute, without tools, a PC can clear rock and debris equal to five times their heavy encumbrance limit. With tools, they clear double this amount. Assume there is 3,000 lbs. of rock.

The PCs may also tunnel through the rock. The walls have a thickness as indicated on the map and count as hewn stone. Alternatively, the PCs can use stone shape or similar magic to punch a hole through the walls.

### Encounter Condition
Distracting Noises, Echoes 8

### Tactics
If the PCs manage to break through the walls and free the slaves, the dwarves are friendly, offering to help the PCs in any way they can, even the duergar. The dwarves are equipped as below. These dwarves have the standard chances of carrying a xill egg inside them (see Region Introduction).

Trapped in a slide, and given their lowly status, they do not know much. They do know the general layout of the various sections in the region, at least by name, though they do not know much about the creatures dwelling in any particular rooms. They warn the Deep Mines house the most dangerous creature in the entire world and encourage the PCs to avoid those tunnels.

## D71. PILE OF BONES

The narrow tunnel widens into a small grotto. Two more tunnels lead out of this room. The floor is rough slate, and clearly treacherous. There are pits and holes in the floor, filled with black stagnant water. The floor clearly slants to the right exit. Black bones with bits of rotted flesh are piled in a pile near the left wall. Otherwise, this room appears to be empty.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This room once held the campsite for the expeditionary force. When they breached the underground lake, this room flooded, and some fearsome subterranean aquatic monster devoured the inhabitants. Now, just their bones and a few puddles of toxic water remain. Foolish PCs who drink the water must succeed a DC 16 Constitution save or contract Blinding Sickness.

#### Blinding Sickness
If ingested, make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to resist. Incubation period 1d3 days, damage 1d4 Strength (each time victim takes 2 or more damage from the disease, they must make another Constitution save or be permanently blinded).

### Encounter Condition

### Tactics
PCs moving down the tunnel to Room D72 must move at one-quarter speed. Moving faster requires the PCs to succeed a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or slide down the tunnel to land in the murky waters and the vast sea of green slime below.

## D72. WATER-FILLED CAVE

The steeply angled tunnel ends on the shores of brackish water that gently laps against the sand. The watery room extends back into darkness, and there are no other visible exits.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This room was originally connected to a network of deeper tunnels, but when the miners accidentally breached the underground lake, the room flooded, killing scores of miners, derro, and formian guards. Now, this room serves as one of the two entrances for these subterranean realms. It descends 30 ft. to the bottom. At the far end is a tunnel leading to the watery tunnels. Unfortunately, this room is also the home for an enormous colony of aquatic green slime, resting just below the surface of the water, unseen for all the water's contamination. It owes its massive size to corpses of the drowned beneath its surface.

### Encounter Condition
Stagnant Air

### Tactics
PCs entering the pool meet with a horrible surprise as green slime coats their bodies. The slime fills the entire room, beneath the water.

#### Green Slime
This dungeon peril is a dangerous variety of normal slime. Green slime devours flesh and organic materials on contact and is even capable of dissolving metal. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches, reproducing as it consumes organic matter. It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and possible food) below.

A single 5-foot square of green slime deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage per round while it devours flesh. On the first round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a creature (most likely destroying the scraping device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing damage to the victim as well). Anything that deals cold or fire damage, sunlight, or a lesser restoration spell destroys a patch of green slime. Against wood or metal, green slime deals 7 (2d6) points of damage per round. It does not harm stone.

GMs not wishing to expand this dungeon should remove the exit at the far end of the Room.

### Treasure
Beneath the green slime, at the bottom of the pool, are 6 adamantine picks.

## D73. XILL CAVE

The tunnel opens into a wide and awkwardly shaped chamber. Hanging 2 ft. above the floor from hooked chains descending from the 30 ft. ceiling, are seven corpses of derro, duergar, and dwarves. They are all in various states of decomposition. One thing unifies them, though they all feature terrible holes in their chests.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
Seven xill cling to the backs of the hanging carcasses, feeding. When the PCs arrive, allow PCs a Wisdom (Perception) check to detect them. If the PCs see them and take any action revealing their awareness, the xill attack. Otherwise, the xill are content to watch them while they eat.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
These xill are aggressive warriors, driven to barbarism after a life in these tunnels. They give no quarter. The xill use bite attacks to paralyze their foes first and destroy those still moving before implanting their eggs.

Aside from a few bones and scraps of sodden cloth, this dead-end tunnel is empty.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Soon after the waters flooding these tunnels receded, a crew of miners worked to salvage the mines. Unfortunately, their grimlock overseer was a bit overzealous, and drove them with its whip harder than normal. The damage caused by his abuse triggered the xill to emerge early from their hosts. The xill consumed the grimlock, leaving his bones here, before pulling the corpses of their hosts to Room D73. Now, this tunnel is empty, save for the bones.

At the far end of this massive tunnel hums a six-wheeled wagon carrying a metal cylindrical tank mounted in an iron cradle, with connecting hoses running to another reservoir. At the tank's rear is a deep dwarf manipulating several levers, while towards the front, another dwarf presses a cone to the wall. In the smaller tunnel beyond are unusual creatures at work, using their cone-like heads and a loud sonic assault to erode the rock.

### Initial Attitude

## D77. DIGGING ZONE

This large cavern extends nearly 60 ft. across, with a ceiling just as high. Sifting down from above are constant streams of dust and pebbles, landing onto the back of an enormous cyclopean, an armed slug-like creature situated in the room's center. Duergar slaves scurry about feeding the thing rocks, before scrambling back before the monster's bodily secretions dissolve them in addition to the stone. Two blind overseers lend an imposing physical presence and the bite of their whips to encourage the duergar to work harder.

### Initial Attitude
Indifferent

### Encounter
The massive central creature is a delver, who dissolves the rock chunks with its corrosive slime. It serves Chtrax, believing the xill holds its mate and brood hostage. Hauling the rock to the delver are ten duergar slaves and their grimlock overseers. The delver is disinterested in working, and so does not excavate the rock unless ordered, content to dissolve the rock brought to it instead. The delver remains here after Day 3, along with half of the duergar and one grimlock.

The farthest edge of the map may extend to more tunnels, more workers and other horrors at the GM's discretion. If you do not wish to expand the dungeon, end with this room.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
When the PCs approach, allow the grimlocks Wisdom (Perception) check opposed by the PCs Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If they succeed, they order their forces to attack. The delver aids the grimlocks 50% of the time. If he does not aid the grimlocks, he either does nothing or sides with the PCs with a 50% chance of either.

The duergar enlarge and turn invisible, maneuvering to gain flanks while the grimlocks drop their whips, draw their battleaxes and charge if possible. The delver, if it attacks, lashes out with its slam attacks against heavily armored foes, leaving the spellcasters for the grimlocks and duergar to deal with.

If both grimlocks die, the delver and the duergar surrender. The delver does not aid the PCs beyond this room, and instead moves toward the Great Hall to find its mate and brood.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, give each of the duergar slaves the rogue Sneak Attack ability (2d6). To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of duergar to five and remove the grimlocks altogether.

## D78. CONFUSED MINERS

The railed track ends up in a small alcove. Four duergar miners steadily dig a tunnel through the rock while a grimlock's presence more than guarantees their continued labor is happening.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
This crew of 4 duergar miners along with their grimlock foreman digs, unknowingly, toward the Great Hall. The confusing effects of the region have turned them around, and they can faintly hear sounds coming through the rock from the hall beyond.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
If the PCs engage these miners, they fight to the death, thinking they are close to reaching Chtrax's prize. The duergar use their spell-like abilities to gain advantage when able, while the grimlock battles the armored PCs.

Left to their own devices, the miners breach the wall of the Great Hall on Day 5, creating a tremor collapsing part of the ceiling onto a random structure. See Random Encounters in the Great Hall for details. After the tremors, Chtrax executes the miners and their grimlock overseer, by dumping them all into the lava flow.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, give the duergar slaves an additional damage die and +2 to attack rolls and give the grimlock the fighter Action Surge and Second Wind (1d10 + 5) abilities. To decrease the challenge, have the PCs surprise the miners.

## D79. MINERS

The railed track ends in a small alcove. A weird creature with a tubular mouth destroys the rock with a sonic attack, while dwarf slaves shovel away the rubble.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
A destrachan destroys the rock with its destructive harmonics, while 4 infected deep dwarf slaves clear away the debris. These creatures are engrossed in their work, so are unlikely to notice the PCs, unless they draw attention to themselves in some egregious way. If so, the slaves and the destrachan fight to a suicidal death.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
The slaves grapple the closest PC, while the destrachan uses its destructive harmonics to collapse the ceiling on the party's rear ranks. If the deep dwarves gain a hold, the destrachan blasts them and the held victim with a flesh-destroying sonic attack.

The destrachan and its deep dwarf slaves hit the first adamantine barrier on Day 5. It takes them two days to break through each barrier. Therefore, these creatures eventually complete the xill master's task on Day 12, but only if the PCs somehow stop the tarrasque first.

### Treasure

The railed track ends in a small alcove. A rat swarm feeds on the carcass of a former slave. A lightweight pick lies discarded on the floor.

### Initial Attitude
Indifferent

### Encounter
A lone deep dwarf miner thought of escaping from this region by secretly mining a tunnel into the floor of this cave when no one was looking. Instead, he found a nest of fiendish rats lying dormant in a pocket in the earth. The rats boiled out of the hole and made short work of the poor dwarf. The swarm of fiendish rats is content to feast on the bones of the dwarf.

This room is empty after Day 4.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
If the PCs provoke the rats, say by attacking or casting a spell, the rats turn on the lead PC, in a frenzy of bites and claws. The rats open with a smite-good attack, regardless of whether the opponent is good or not. The rats fight till death.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add six fiendish rat swarms that emerge on the second round of combat. To decrease the challenge, replace the fiendish rat swarm with a rat swarm.

## D81-D84. THE DEVIL VAULT

Chtrax's goal, the Devil Vault, is a nest of vile evil, a prison withstanding thousands of years, earthquakes, the rise and fall of civilizations, as it has never failed to contain the darkness within. Eons ago, before mankind stirred from the sleep of creation, Asrakhor the Undying, the Destroyer and the Void incarnate, surged madly in the planes and brought war to the heavens. Great celestial cities, infernal strongholds and even the halls of the gods succumbed in the clutches of his foul hand. Though the Nemesis' destructive ability was a dire threat, his corrupting aura brought all manner of outsiders beneath his banner. From these fallen celestials rose a particularly corrupted Solar called Kator. This fallen angel gathered to him a host of loyal followers and served the mad god and his fell purposes, laying siege to the gates of heaven. Thousands of years passed, with terrific losses to both sides. It was only when the good and evil gods joined forces that they were able to defeat Asrakhor and imprison him beyond reach in a cosmic prison for all eternity.

With the dark god at bay, there remained the matter of its servants. The evil gods demanded the destruction of these dark servants, but the good gods offered quarter, and the gods of light took responsibility for their incarceration. The gods dispatched celestials to the Material Plane to construct a prison to contain these fallen celestials for all eternity.

The total area of the vault measures 140 ft. by 100 ft., but the actual prison itself is small. Its size is deceptive however, for it originally held all 300,000 of Asrakhor's servants in a sphere appearing only 50 ft. in diameter. The sphere is actually a nexus to a pocket dimension large enough to house all of the fiends but encapsulated by a sphere of sacred force.

The borders of the Demiplane were not strong enough to contain the raw hate and evil within, so the celestial designers gave their lives to serve as conduits to fuel the energies required to reinforce the heavenly boundaries. The essence of four solars occupied the four corners of the vault, their inherent goodness enough to channel the energies of their divine creatures to buttress the magical barrier (the red lines in Room D81).

Even the sacrifice of the four archangels was not enough to guarantee the permanence of the prison. The builders coated the interior walls with truesilver from the natural deposits found throughout the area surrounding the site. Celestial craftsmen surrounded the vault with bands of magical adamantine and as long as those bands remained intact, they would generate an effect similar to a wall of force (the green lines, Room D82). Filling in the gaps are clouds of raw sacred magical energy, making the Vault inhospitable for fiends, and lending to the magical impediments preventing teleportation effects, plane travel and divination magic.

With these defenses in place, the gods and celestials were confident in the vault's defenses, and over time, expanded the dungeon, imprisoning more of Asrakhor's minions, using inevitables, celestials and more to safeguard the world from the evil inside the massive dungeon. Eventually, the gods and the forces of good forgot about the massive complex, as their attention turned to the affairs of mortals and creation.

Now, Chtrax threatens the vault's integrity, pressing forward with his minions. As he draws closer to his goals, the wards and defenses gradually fail until ultimately, when the tarrasque breaches the walls, the prison collapses, releasing Kator into the world once more. As noted in the introduction, if the PCs do nothing to stop the tarrasque, it breaches the first set of adamantine bands on Day 4, collapsing two of the walls of force and depleting the sacred energies within. The impediment on divination magic ends. On Day 5, the tarrasque breaches the second band of adamantine, collapsing another wall of force. The impediments on teleportation end in this region. On Day 6, the tarrasque breaks through the final adamantine band, and the final wall of force collapses, dispersing all of the sacred energies and ending the plane travel impediments in this region. Finally, on Day 7, the tarrasque breaks inside rhe Devil Vault. With the vaults integrity destroyed, the solars' essences fail and the reinforcement to the magical barrier collapses entirely. The sphere warps and twists, collapsing completely after 3 rounds, returning the devils to the Material Plane. Chtrax cannot place the collar and manacles on Kator before the devil and his legions overwhelm him.

As soon as the devils break free, they fight the tarrasque, led by the infamous Kator, with a mixture of spell-like abilities and the devils' abilities to summon more of their kind. They quickly overrun the tarrasque and punch through the formian defenses, spilling throughout the region, slaughtering formians, derro, dwarves and other living things they encounter along the way. After one day, the devils conquer the entire region, and plot to conquer the rest of the dungeon. After two more weeks of feasting and terrible hunting, the army of devils march on the neighboring regions.

The release of the devils has a dynamic effect on the rest of this region. During the day of the devil raids, all the devils use their summon abilities to draw more of their kind into the region. They move quickly throughout the complex.

### Follow This Timeline:

| Hours | Event |
|:-----:|:------|
| 0 to 3 | Devils gain control of the Deep Mines. |
| 4 to 5 | Devils conquer the Great Hall. |
| 6 | Devils take the Western and Northern Mines. |
| 7 | Devils take the Old Mines. |

Once the devils conquer the region, replace the inhabitants with the following creatures, regardless of whether the PCs defeated the original inhabitants.

The only way the PCs can save the day is to take the truesilver manacles and collar and place them on Kator. This is exceptionally difficult, as the pit fiend never sleeps and has no interest in wearing them. The PCs must ensnare the devil though a magic circle, or defeat the creature in combat, dealing nonlethal damage until he falls unconscious or is defeated in some other way. If they position the manacles and collar on the devil, they can use its wish to return all of the devils to prison. Be as lenient as possible on the wish's wording unless the PCs are foolish enough to use the wish for themselves. If the PCs fail, what happens is up to the GM. Perhaps the gods return their attention to the lost prison and exert their influence to restore the devils to their prison. On the other hand, Kator could simply leave the dungeon from this region and unleash the Nemesis onto the Planes once more, for a campaign of epic proportions.
