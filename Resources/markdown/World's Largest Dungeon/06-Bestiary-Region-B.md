## Argliss, Goblin King

*Medium fey, chaotic evil*

**Armor Class:** 14  
**Hit Points:** 62 (12d10 + 12)  
**Speed:** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 10 (+0) | 18 (+4) | 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) |

**Saving Throws:** Cha +4, Dex +8  
**Skills:** Deception +3, Performance +3, Persuasion +3  
**Senses:** Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 11  
**Languages:** Common, Goblin, Sylvan  
**Challenge:** 4 (1,100 XP)

### Special Abilities

**Pretender King.** In his presence, the goblins fight with impossible fervor. His subjects are immune to the frightened condition while within 100 ft. of him. If a melee or ranged attack strikes Argliss while a goblin is within 5 ft., that goblin dives in the way and takes the hit instead. Should Argliss be forced to transform and flee, these benefits are lost, and all goblins affected are frightened of the PCs for one turn. It is up to the DM's discretion whether or not this breaks the goblins' morale completely.

**Ambusher.** Argliss has advantage on attack rolls against any creature he has surprised.

**Doppelganger Ancestry.** Argliss has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep.

**Shapechanger.** As an action, Argliss can shape-change into a medium or smaller humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Any equipment he is wearing is transformed. If Argliss dies, he reverts to his true form.

**Vest of Escape.** Argliss' vest, combined with his shape-changing abilities, lets him wriggle from any bind he is put in easily. PCs that wear the vest find these benefits conferred similarly, granting advantage on any check made to resist grapples and escape bonds.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Argliss makes three Dagger attacks. He can replace one attack with a use of the Wand of Wonder.

**Silver Dagger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage. If Argliss has advantage on this attack roll add 1d6 to the weapon damage.

**Necklace of Fireballs.** Argliss may cast *fireball* at 3rd and 5th level without expending a spell slot or material requirements. He may do this once for each spell level before his necklace has permanently exhausted itself.

**Wand of Wonder.** Argliss carries a "royal scepter" that is a crudely gilded Wand of Wonder. Each use expends one of its 7 charges.

### Possessions

Silver dagger, Crown of the Goblin King (Headband of Intellect), Scepter of the Goblin King (Wand of Wonder), necklace of fireballs (one 3rd-level fireball and one 5th-level fireball, does not recharge).

**Spell Resistance.** The vargouille has advantage on saves against spell effects.

### Actions

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or begin turning into a vargouille. In 1d6 hours, the victim's hair falls out. 1d6 hours later, its ears grow into leathery wings, tentacles grow out of the chin and scalp, and its teeth become long, pointed fangs. 1d6 hours later, the creature dies and its head is a complete vargouille which detaches from the body. No cure or resurrection is possible at this point. *Remove curse*, *lesser restoration*, sunlight (including that generated by a spell), or *greater restoration* immediately halts the transformation, but only *greater restoration* reverses it.

**Shriek.** The vargouille opens its distended mouth and lets out a shriek, affecting non-vargouilles within 30 ft. to attempt a DC 13 Constitution Saving Throw or be frightened for 2d4 rounds or until the monster attacks them or breaks line of sight. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Shriek of all vargouilles for 24 hours.
