# Region A (continued)

## A46. Workshop

The western door to this room is locked, but simple enough to pick, or break open with a DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Strength (Athletics) check.

The southeastern door to this room is closed and trapped. Draconic writing on the door reads "Danger. Do Not Enter." The doorway is trapped with an automatically resetting burning hands trap. The trap activates the moment any creature opens the door to Room A46. It shoots down from the ceiling in a cone shape, striking the square in front of the door on both sides. Because the vent is built into the archway, this trap is nearly impossible to spot.

> **Burning Hands Trap.** Deals 3d6 fire damage in a 15-foot cone. Creatures take half damage on a successful DC 8 Dexterity saving throw. DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disarm. Automatically resets when the door closes.

Read the following once the PCs open the door.

> Although this room is now empty, you can all but guess at its previous purpose. A complete forge sits in one corner. A large workbench, along with two stools, dominates the center, while there are numerous hooks and nails on the wall, indicating a place where tools were once kept. A hallway leads on past this area.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This was at one time a workshop. The place was cleaned out, but the forge couldn't be moved. Although covered with dust, the forge is still functional if fuel is found.

There is a 3 in 20 chance of finding a fiendish fire mephit trapped in the furnace. Silver-inscribed runes keep the mephit here. If the runes are broken, cracked, or somehow erased, the mephit escapes or returns to its home plane (GM's choice). If the fire mephit is antagonized with water or liquids, it erupts in a ball of expansive flame, much like the trap in this Room.

### Encounter Condition
Safe

### Tactics
Assuming the PCs survive the trap or bypass it, this is an excellent Room to rest.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the trap damage to 5d6, and the likelihood of a fiendish fire mephit being present to 7 in 20. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, reduce the trap damage to 2d6, and allow the fiendish fire mephit to grant one minor boon if it is freed.

## A47. Laboratory

> Several tables are pushed up along the sides of this room, along with a trio of stools.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This was a magical laboratory. Unlike the one in Room A40, this one did not sustain any major damage. The valuable equipment was cleaned out, but a couple of items were left behind.

PCs examining the tables can note discoloration and burn marks from the use of various chemicals during the experiments. A DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check of the Room reveals several piles of glass shards from broken beakers and containers. Bare-foot creatures have avoided the Room for this very reason.

### Encounter Condition
Distracting Noises or Haunted

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
A PC willing to search (DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check) through the glass shards is rewarded with a small, flawed diamond (500 gp).

More importantly, the owner of the lab created three hiding places for some of his lesser creations.

**First Hiding Place:** A small metal box, about 4 inches in length, 4 inches in width, and 2 inches in height, that attaches under one of the tables and is found relatively easily with a DC 11 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

This box is trapped with a poison blade holding greenblood oil weakened with age. The razor-sharp blade releases when the box is opened, slicing across the box opening and cutting into flesh. A PC that shakes the box hears small objects rattling within. Unfortunately, this box is a red herring and contains only a few pebbles.

> **Poison Blade Trap.** +7 to hit, one target within 20 ft. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 point of Constitution damage for 24 hours. A creature immune to poison is immune to this effect. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 11 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to disarm.

**Second Hiding Place:** Behind one of the rocks of the furnace. The mechanism is actually a flat piece of rock attached to a metal flap that is lifted to gain access to the space behind; it is revealed by a more difficult DC 18 Investigation check. This hiding place is also guarded by a spring-loaded punching dagger blade that flies out the moment the rock flap is lifted, punching itself into the face or chest of the person opening the door. The blade is coated with greenblood oil that has lost much of its potency.

> **Punching Dagger Trap.** +7 to hit one target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 point of Constitution damage for 24 hours. A creature immune to poison is immune to this effect. DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, DC 11 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to disarm.

Located in the hollow space behind the mechanism are three arcane scrolls — *magic missile*, *guidance*, and *flaming sphere*.

**Third Hiding Place:** The most difficult to find (DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check) and is actually a hollow stool leg that contains a *wand of acid arrow* (17 charges). The wand gives no clue as to its function and *identify* only reveals the command word (bahris-kyh). If the PCs *detect magic*, the wand radiates magic, but no school can be discovered.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, restore the potency of the greenblood oil poison. To reduce the challenge, remove the poison.

## A48. Collapsing Energy Field

The door to this area is closed and has draconic writing on it that warns "Danger. Do Not Enter."

> A large, shimmering ruby-red crystal about the height of a human floats in the center of the chamber some three feet off the ground. The ever-present energy of both good and evil can be felt stepping into the room.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The ruby red crystal is the remnant of an energy field that once held a minor devil. It lost its primary function when the fiend escaped, but it still has enough energy to be dangerous should any person or object disturb its surface. The kobolds never touched it, sensing something dangerous about the stone.

The shimmering is actually a result of the slow ebbing of the field's energy. Disturbing the energy field's surface in a physical manner, be it through touch, using a pole, throwing a stone, etc., causes the protective field to collapse in on itself and release the remaining energy in a 20 ft. radius all around the ruby. This release causes 3d4 points of force damage to all within the radius. Those caught in the blast can attempt a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage. There is no way to disarm the energy field.

### Encounter Condition
Drafty, Safe (if the PCs leave the ruby alone)

### Tactics
The first time a PC speaks within earshot of the crystal, a devilish laugh echoes off the energy field. The sound pierces through the quiet of the area, alerting all the nearby Rooms that someone is here.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the force damage to 4d6. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, reduce the force damage to 2d4 and the radius to 15 ft.

## A49. The Long Hallway

All the doors leading into this hallway are open.

> The length of this room extends beyond the edge of your light source. Here lies an orc corpse, there rests a dead kobold, and over there, a flying octopus, with three of its tentacles severed, lies limp against the wall. Bones and other bits against another wall. The lengthy chamber is a miasma of corpses and debris. Scuffles have obviously been happening here for a while.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The key to controlling Region A lies in controlling this hallway, as it affords access to the rest of the dungeon. Orghar made it one of his key objectives when planning the orc assault. Although they were officially neutral, the kobolds realized the significance of this hallway, as well, and always kept a guard force nearby. Although numerically superior, the orcs had difficulty controlling the hallway due to the presence of Boyikt, a kobold wizard, and his brother Borryn. However, as with the battle in the kobold stronghold (Rooms A41 through A45), the sudden appearance of extraplanar beasts ended the fight in a way neither side anticipated.

Numerous dead lie in the hallway, including orcs, kobolds, a couple of krenshar, fiendish stirges, fiendish darkmantles, and even some fiendish dire rats (exact numbers up to the GM). Otherwise, the hall is strangely empty.

The smell is nearly as bad as the musk in the northwest corner of the region.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
Given the importance of this place and the numerous paths for access, the GM should roll for Random Encounters while the PCs are in the Room. One roll when the PCs enter and another just before they leave is ideal, although there can certainly be more.

These encounters need not be hostile, though some creatures will be shocked to see humans (and their ilk) in the dungeon. Some might even have questions.

### Treasure

## A50. Kobold Guard Post

The doors to this Room are open.

> Shackled to the wall in the southwestern corner is the skeleton of a kobold, standing over a reddish and green slime. The skeleton moves and twitches, kicking harder when someone approaches, but it is no use. The slime bubbles and gurgles, mimicking the pattern of your footsteps.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Although neutral by agreement, the kobolds kept a regular group of guards here. When the orcs attacked, the guards joined the battle in the hallway (Room A49).

Both the skeleton and slime radiate necromantic magic.

Boyikt used his magic to turn some of the dead kobolds into skeletal warriors to join the fight. This one refused to stay down and they had to shackle it to the wall. The slime at his feet is the brain his skull once housed, now dissolved into a bloody goo. Should anyone cast *dispel magic* onto the brain, it returns to the shape of a kobold brain.

PCs investigating the Room have a chance to spot a metal plate trigger in the floor at the northwest corner. When pressure is applied and kept on the plate, a loud click can be heard. When pressure is released, the click is heard again. This turns off and turns on the hallucination trap in Room A97. It wouldn't take more than a few pounds of weight on the plate to keep the trap turned off. PCs won't know what it goes to, but they will know it does something.

## A51. "The Coffin"

The door to this Room is closed. The smell here is as bad as the musk in the northwest corner of the Region.

> Several skeletons of varying sizes lie about the room, rags hanging off their bones. The smell is almost unbearable, forcing you to cover your nose.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Given the Room's isolation, it is ideal for body disposal. All manner of humanoid and beast has been thrown here over the centuries creating a distinct pile of bones and rotting flesh.

A large stone grind wheel has been turned over, but closer inspection shows it was used to grind bone years ago. Rust and decay have rendered it less than useful.

### Encounter Condition
Safe

### Tactics
There is a 1 in 20 chance of encountering a pair of kobolds or orcs disposing of a body while the PCs are present. They are not ready for a fight and may just want to step away, unless the PCs press for combat. There is an additional 1 in 20 chance of a fiendish rat swarm having a meal. If neither of those events happens, there is a 3 in 20 chance of a fiendish snake swarm present in the body pile, though it finds no need to attack unless necessary. There is plenty to eat.

### Treasure
Some bone dust lies on the ground. Enough can be gathered to be used to create protection circles and the like as a powerful material component. A DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals this information to a wizard or warlock. If it is used in this manner, it doubles the duration of the protection circle.

### Scaling

## A52. Secret Throne Room

The door to this Room is open.

> This large room has a simple throne carved from stone situated near the eastern end. Bits of chain and iron rings hammered into stone unleash a sense of dread. The taste and smell of something fiendish permeates the air. The sounds of groans and soft crying can be heard, but no one is there. It is as though the walls themselves are in pain.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
It is unclear who altered this Room and used it for evil, but minions were tortured here for the viewing pleasure of whosoever sat upon the throne. Sharp-eyed PCs can pick out numerous large rust-red stains on the floor (DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check), the blood of those executed here.

The throne is non-descript, having an almost alien appearance to the thrones of human kings. It has been hewn from a single piece of rock — just the right size for a dwarf or similar-sized creature. Two red gems are cut into the backrest, like eyes staring back at the PCs. Shadowy forms inside the gems enhance the creepiness of a pareidolic headrest.

There is a definite unease about this cursed throne. The vile deeds perpetuated by its owner have warped the stone into something evil and hateful. Any living creature who touches the throne is subject to the curse and must succeed at a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw (rolled in secret by the GM). If the save fails, the cursed creature is afflicted with confusion but does not notice the change. If the save is made, the PC is still cursed but aware that something strange has taken place.

The PC is not aware of the curse at first and acts outwardly normal. However, anytime the PC is in a stressful situation, such as combat or trying to perform a skill check quickly, the confusion surfaces.

Roll on the following table the first round that a PC is confused.

| d20 | Behavior |
|:---:|:---------|
| 1-5 | Attack the nearest ally (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self) |
| 6-7 | Become nauseated (unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a creature can take is a single move action per turn) |
| 8-13 | Cower (take no actions, –2 penalty to Armor Class and loses his Dexterity bonus) |
| 14-18 | Flee away from the area at the top possible speed |
| 19-20 | Twitch uncontrollably (–2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks) |

The confused condition passes the moment immediately thereafter or when a stressful situation passes. Note that the curse can afflict any number of creatures and can be countered just like the spell *bestow curse*.

Otherwise, the curse lasts for a number of days equal to 16 minus the PCs Wisdom score at the time of the curse (minimum two days).

The painful sounds emanating in the room grow louder the longer the PCs remain. Tormented spirits, though not manifesting as threats, still live within the blood, chains, and walls. They will remain here forever until a cleric or other holy person casts a spell that can release them. Even something as simple as *bless* might do it.

PCs who get too close to the chains and iron rings find themselves grappling with animated chains.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the Wisdom saving throw DC to 17. To reduce the challenge of this encounter, the curse lasts only one day.

## A53. Western Gallery

Rooms A53 and A54 share the space, though encounters are slightly different.

The southern door in the hallway is open. Read the following description once the PCs have moved down the hall and turned west.

> A number of skeletons from a range of creatures hang on the walls spaced equally apart, iron spikes visible below their bones. More bones dot the floor, spread out and broken.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
After the demons broke out, hundreds of years ago, they took over portions of the dungeon in a mad orgy of violence. For a time, Room A53 served as a "gallery of torture." During its time, the walls held the mounted corpses of a number of creatures from drow to duergar and every humanoid in between. Since then, time has reduced the corpses to skeletons making it more difficult to identify the individual species of each.

The exact composition of the bodies is up to the GM; any humanoid up to Large size is present. Given the limited encounters that the PCs of levels 1 to 3 have had with humanoids, they probably can't identify the various creatures, although such things as an ogre, an orc, a dwarf, an elf, a halfling, etc. might be familiar.

Once complete, a number of the skeletons are missing such things as a head, an arm, a leg, etc. Casting *animate dead* on these bones produces truly disturbing skeletons.

### Encounter Condition
Distracting Visions or Haunted

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
Some personal effects might be found among the bones, but nothing of immediate value. Bracelets, rings, dull knives, earrings, costume jewelry, and combs (for instance) are among the various items strewn around the room.

## A54. Eastern Gallery

Rooms A53 and A54 share the space, though encounters are slightly different.

The southern door in the hallway is open. Read the following description once the PCs have moved down the hall and turned east.

> A number of skeletons from different creatures hang on the walls spaced equally apart, iron spikes visible below their bones. More bones dot the floor, spread out and broken.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Identical to Room A53 in shape, this Room houses the more unusual skeletons of the collection, such as mummified lamia, and the rotted carcass of a two-headed wolf-dog-creature (exact composition is up to the GM) all mounted on iron spikes.

### Encounter Condition

## A55. Guard Room

The door to this Room is closed.

> Pieces of broken furniture and a dirty floor indicate someone once lived here. A single broken bed lies near the center of the room. Rubble and rags have been piled up in the northeastern corner. The smell of unwashed feet and disgusting food linger in the air. One can almost imagine orcs still living in here.

### Initial Attitude
Varies

### Encounter
Behind the rubble is a near-dead orc (1 hp), who was left behind during the last retreat through here. The other orcs assumed he was dead when he didn't respond. Rather than leave their friend out in the open, they left him behind the rubble. They took his weapons and personal effects, however, leaving him with pants and boots.

How he escaped the notice of the fiendish creatures nearby is anyone's guess.

The orc has numerous wounds and a dented skull. If the PCs are able to heal him and bring him back, he has amnesia. He doesn't even know his own name. He does not speak Common and may not be able to communicate with the PCs. The orc will not join the PCs and will run the first chance he gets. If forced to help, he will pretend to be an ally before running into the dungeon when they are not watching.

Stats are not provided for this orc. If the PCs choose to kill him, the fight is over quickly.

### Encounter Condition
Deep Darkness

### Tactics
Four rounds after the PCs have been in the Room, four hungry fiendish darkmantles enter looking for a quick meal. They immediately turn the Room dark with their aura and then descend to feed. They fight desperately and to the death in some depraved fashion. They make hungry, gnashing noises that impart disadvantage to the PCs during the first round of combat.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the orc turn on one of the PCs in a fit of fear and panic. He tries to steal an item and run away with it or bash someone from behind with a rock. To reduce the challenge of this encounter, reduce the number of fiendish darkmantles to three.

## A56. Guard Room

The door to this Room is closed.

> A broken table lies upturned against one wall, while a heavy wooden chest leans against the table. The walls and floors are non-descript, though there are dozens of tally marks cut into one wall. Along the floor are various, tiny torn pieces of paper.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This Room served as the home of a guard captain, but any functioning furniture was cleaned out during a regroup and retreat. The table was left alone as it had no value. The chest was left because it holds a special trap.

The chest contains a silver dagger wrapped in the skin of a darkmantle. The skin has been carefully cut from the organs, stretched, and made into a wrap, or small cloak. It's unclear of its intended purpose.

Once the skin is unraveled a *glyph of warding* is exposed. The *glyph of warding* (explosive runes) affects only the character holding the skin, dealing 5d8 lightning damage and forcing the character to scream in pain. A successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw halves the damage and the character does not scream. The dagger is not affected by the spell.

Scattered on the floor are tiny shreds of paper, perhaps from a journal or log. Whatever was written on them was in another language, and few full words remain. PCs may attempt to piece it together, revealing a kobold letter detailing the mind-numbing work of being a guard.

### Encounter Condition

## A57-A77. Earthquake Damage

Both the reptilians and orcs avoid the area covering Rooms A57 through A77 and the hallways in between. Almost destroyed in the heavy earthquakes that damaged the entire complex, the area is unstable. Chunks of the ceiling lay everywhere, making it an easy place to hide in but a difficult place to maneuver through. When the occasional tremor rumbles through this portion of the complex, it causes more dust, dirt, and rocks to fall from the ceiling, giving the entire area a sense of imminent annihilation; no creature willingly makes its home here.

That is not to say that there are not currently some residents. Extraplanar scavengers roam the area hoping to find an easy meal. A handful of reptilian refugees also hide in the area, hoping to escape notice.

The unstable and damaged condition of the area creates an interesting tactical situation for the PCs and any creatures that rely on land movement. The rubble that is strewn everywhere hampers movement throughout the entire area; each square moved costs double. The rubble also prevents any land-based charges or running throughout the entire area. Finally, any land-based attempts to Stealth are rolled with disadvantage due to the rock and grit underfoot.

**Note:** Major tremors in this Section have the potential to collapse parts of tunnels, sections of Rooms, block doors, etc., making it even more difficult to move through the area or even get out at all. If a door or passage is blocked by rocks, it requires 1d20 minutes to clear the space for a Medium creature to squeeze through.

---

## A57. Nearly Empty Room

The door to this Room has been wedged partially open by the earthquake and requires a DC 18 Strength check to force it completely open.

> Darker than most rooms, rubble and dust cover the floor. Squinting your eyes, you can see a small boot sticking from behind a stack of rocks.

### Initial Attitude
Varies

### Encounter
This Room appears empty, but if the PCs investigate they find the boot is on the foot of a halfling near death. The halfling is hiding from nearby creatures and hoping for some kind of intervention.

The purpose of this encounter is two-fold. One, this is a chance for the PCs to meet an NPC who may or may not join the group. Two, if a PC has died, this halfling could be their replacement. Therefore, the name, class, and gender of the halfling are left for the gamemaster to define.

If the halfling remains an NPC, he/she/they slipped into the dungeon by accident a few weeks ago and snuck around in the dark avoiding the dangers. The halfling doesn't know where the major factions are in this area, but might be able to draw a crude map of earthquake hallways.

The halfling knows there are nearby monsters and speaks quietly. The halfling is also slathered in some kind of oil and musk that is reminiscent of skunk and lavender. It is strange, but not overwhelming. It conceals his/her/their scent from the nearby rats.

### Encounter Condition
Tremors 14

### Tactics
Allow any creatures or random encounters (perhaps prep them after this) in Rooms A58, A60, A61, and A62 to roll Wisdom (Perception) checks at advantage opposed by a Stealth check by whoever opened the door to Room A57.

Should the PCs decide to kill the halfling, the combat is over in seconds, but the creatures in Room A58 definitely hear it without requiring a roll.

**Note:** If the PCs have already dealt with the other monsters, ignore the concerns about noise. though the halfling may be more ready for the group in such a case.

### Treasure
The halfling carries a wineskin, two more days of rations, a perfume bottle with oily perfume, a torch, some rope, and a personal weapon. If the PCs have already made a level or two before arriving here, the weapon is magical.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, place a small hole in the wall between Rooms A57 and A58. Something might come through when the PCs least expect it, or the creatures in Room A58 already hear the PCs coming. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, do not allow the nearby creatures an advantage of any Wisdom (Perception) checks.

---

## A58. Fiendish Mephits

The earthquake forced both doors off their hinges. They lay on a pile of rubble just inside the doorway. The western one is far worse than the eastern one, which acts as a semi-barrier to entry.

> This rubble-strewn room appears to have an exit; you can make out the top half of a door in the wall across from this doorway. Darkness and dust shroud the contents as strange shadows dance on the walls.

### Initial Attitude
Hostile

### Encounter
This Room is filled with rubble. Parts of the ceiling have given way, collapsing inward, along with dirt and granite. There appears to be three fiendish darkmantles among the rocks near the center of the room. However, they are exceptionally difficult to distinguish from dust, dirt, and boulders (DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check).

Also hiding amongst the rocks is a fiendish dire rat. It waits to feed on whatever falls into its lap. It is not aggressive, but will defend itself.

### Encounter Condition
Poor Footing 4

### Tactics
The well-camouflaged fiendish darkmantles are, in fact, fiendish steam mephits wearing the hides of dead darkmantles. Most likely, the mephits gain surprise and can move and attack before the PCs. They roll initiative separately, acting as unique individuals. The mephits wait until a PC is within 10 ft. to attack, throwing off the dead skin onto the PC, and then taking action.

The first mephit casts *misty step* (which lasts for 1 minute) and teleports to behind the PCs, the second mephit uses its steam attack, and the third mephit flies into melee range with an exposed PC, using its claw attack. Mix it up round after round, after this.

Treat the mephit's use of the darkmantle skin as a ranged attack, at advantage. If a mephit hits, that character is blinded until an action is spent removing the skin. If the attack fails, the skin falls to the ground with no effect.

The fiendish dire rat only fights if it needs to, helping the mephits flank if the opportunity arises. The mephits tolerate the rat and vice versa, though they turn on one another if the need arises, most likely after the fight is over.

The rubbled floor creates uneven footing for the PCs meaning any Dexterity check or saving throw is made with disadvantage. This does not affect the fiendish steam mephits, nor the fiendish dire rat.

*Misty step* works up to 30 feet, so one of the fiendish steam mephits can teleport just outside the door or to the other side of the Room if necessary.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter add two fiendish dire rats and have them engage the PCs aggressively. To decrease the challenge, remove the darkmantle skins from two of the mephits.

## A59. Closet

The earthquake caused the lintel above the door to collapse. As a result, the door requires a DC 15 Strength check to open, which causes the lintel to collapse further, like a falling block trap.

> **Falling Block Trap.** +7 to hit one target (whoever opened the door). On a hit, the target suffers 3d6 bludgeoning damage. DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find, DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check to disarm.

Once the door is opened, read the following text.

> Peering through the narrow juncture, you can see a number of opened chests lined against one wall of this small room.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
The Room contains four opened and emptied wooden chests of varying sizes and qualities and one closed one. Some torn sacks lie on the floor as well. Some soiled blankets remain from when someone used this Room to rest. Metal shavings and chipped stone lie inside one of the chests, where someone has sharpened a blade.

Inside the closed chest is a warlock's familiar, a cat. During a fight, the cat hid in the chest and it snapped shut. He's been in there for days, unable to get out. The warlock is presumed dead, but is actually alive in Room A99. The cat's name is Gypsum, though it's a cat so it won't respond to the name anyway.

The PCs are welcome to take the cat with them, though the cat still behaves like a cat despite its high intelligence. Should the PCs attempt to communicate with the cat (using empathy, magic, skills, etc.), they must succeed on a DC14 Intelligence (Arcana) or a DC14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. If they offer the hungry Gypsum some food, this check is made at advantage. If they win Gypsum over, the cat quickly comes to understand their objectives slightly better and tries to attach itself to a magic-user, preferably a wizard (or someone who can take on an animal companion).

Should the GM approve, a PC may always cast *find familiar* on the cat, adding it to his retinue. And should the party find the warlock (Nylinn) in Room A99, he will probably want his cat back.

Once the Room is cleaned up, this is a safe place for the PCs to rest, especially with only one way in. It is even possible to rig up a pulley, using a rope, to enable the fallen lintel to be raised and lowered from within quite easily–negating the need for a Strength check each time the PCs wish to enter. With a little thought, the PCs could turn this into an effective outpost for themselves.

### Encounter Condition
Safe, Tremors 10

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
Amidst the debris on the ground are a few soiled blankets and shards of metal. PCs succeeding at a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check find a torn bag filled with 16 gp and a chipped eye agate (55 gp). This eye agate belonged to the now-missing wizard.

All of the chests have long since been looted.

There is one of interest, however. On a DC14 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check, a false bottom can be discovered in one of the chests. Beneath the false bottom is a portal connecting this chest to one of the other empty chests in Room A67. Any item of small size passed through this portal ends up in the chest in A67 and vice versa. This magical effect is permanent, and the distance between the two chests has no impact on how effective it is. Clever PCs can likely think of dozens of ways of making use of this connection.

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) DCs of the falling block trap to 20 and increase the damage to 3d6. To decrease the challenge, reduce the Intelligence (Investigation) and Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) DCs to 12 each and reduce the damage to 1d6.

## A60-A63. Solitary Cells

These small cells are near-identical. The door to each is closed, but there is a locking bolt on the outside. The PCs may deduce that these were holding cells for something.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Due to their narrow construction, these former cells have managed to escape the damage suffered by the rest of this area. Each cell contains a series of crude graffiti depicting orcs triumphing over their foes, bullying troglodytes, and crushing kobold skulls beneath their feet. They contain little essential information, but if the characters take some time to study them, they gain advantage on their next Intelligence (History) or Intelligence (Investigation) check related to the orc presence in the region.

The doors to these cells are fully functional.

There is a 3 in 20 chance of finding the remnants of an extraplanar creature's remains under the rubble.

## A64. Solitary Cell

The door to this Room is locked with a bolt on this side. Opening the door is easy enough, but the PCs may ask first, "What is locked inside?"

> A rotting dead orc lies on top of a pile of rubble. The earth below is ruptured, and viney plants grow up around the rubble wherever it can reach. Some of the plant life has tangled around the rotting corpse, begging the question: how long has the orc been dead, and how fast do the vines grow?

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Captured and killed by the kobolds, this orc sorceress was thrown into this cell and locked inside after being strangled. To be sure she could not come back and harm them, the kobolds locked the cell from the outside.

The plants in this cell grow faster because of the magical nature of the orc. She continued to exude magical energy, even in death, drawing the plants closer to her. In time, the vines will eventually animate the orc, and she will return as a revenant with some druidic powers.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
The shin bones of the orc have come loose from the flesh and cartilage. Since the orc was a sorcerer, the bone has some magical properties. But to what end? The GM is encouraged to allow the PCs to get creative with it if they clean it up and study the bone.

## A65. Solitary Cell

The door to this Room is open.

> Pushing open the slightly open door, you see another cell filled with rocks and destruction. Rubble piles up, cracking the stonework. Exposed dirt beneath the floor shows signs of viney plants growing through the cracks. And with plant life comes insects.

### Initial Attitude
Unfriendly

### Encounter
As the PCs stay longer in the Room, more and more insects climb up the vines. This may not be noticeable at first, but eventually the floor will be filled with bugs. Every manner of bug. After 15 minutes, enough bugs will appear to form a fiendish insect swarm.

### Encounter Condition
N/A

### Tactics
If the PCs stay too long, the swarm burrows its way into their boots and bites at their feet. If the PCs leave, the swarm eventually finds them an hour later. If the PCs defeat this one, another swarm shows up in one week's time.

For some inexplicable reason, the swarm cannot see/sense elven characters, who become immune to the swarm's attacks. This should not be evident for a few rounds of combat.

### Treasure
N/A

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, add a second swarm, three rounds after this one appears. To decrease the challenge of this encounter, allow the PCs Wisdom checks to notice the swarm forming one round before it attacks.

## A66. Prison

All of the doors to this Room are open.

> The floor is covered in rubble. Wood and linen lie crushed under hundreds of pounds of stone. Centipedes and other bugs feed on whatever they can find, turning on one another as well. A dead dire rat lies on its side, bloated stomach exposed to the elements and being eaten from the inside out by insects.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
Everything is buried under rubble that comes up to the average human's waist. Although this Room reveals nothing of interest, it is the gateway to the vault at Room A67.

The PCs must clamber across the top of the rubble to reach any of the numerous doors in this Room. Doing so requires a successful DC14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A failure results in 1d3 falling damage as the characters tumble down, shredding hands, knees, and dignity. The PCs only need to make this check the first time they attempt the rubble.

The walls here are unstable and it is possible for the PCs to cause a wall to collapse inward. If they are clumsy or dash around the Room without a care, have the wall collapse on someone.

> **Collapsing Wall Trap.** Creatures in a 15-ft. cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage. Creatures that succeed take half damage. DC 14 Investigation check to find, DC 16 Strength check to disable.

## A67. Prison Vault

The door to this Room is partially open. Rubble blocks the doorway except for a narrow 1-ft. wide opening. Inside, magical darkness eats up most of the light.

> Though the door will not budge, you can see into the room from the doorway. The darkness of this room becomes evident. While you can see the edges of the room from your torchlight, the light only barely reaches. It is as though the darkness was swallowing the light.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This was once a prison vault for items of minor importance. Magical darkness stops light from traveling too far or illuminating the details. Any check related to sight suffers disadvantage on the roll. *Dispel magic* will not negate this magical darkness, and a *light* spell is only a temporary fix.

A Small creature or smaller can crawl through the opening without a problem. A creature of Medium size must succeed at a DC 19 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to pass through the existing opening. A Large creature or larger cannot pass through.

Attempts to widen the opening require caution. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the entire thing will collapse unless properly shored up and also how to go about doing so. If these skills are not available, then treat the threat of collapse as a falling block trap.

> **Falling Block Trap.** +7 to hit one target (whoever opened the door). On a hit, the target suffers 3d6 bludgeoning damage. DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation check to find, DC 16 Strength (athletics) check to disarm.

Widening the opening properly requires 1d6 hours. Attempts to widen the opening without the benefit of a successful check results in the entire thing collapsing and burying the entire doorway under rubble, causing the damage stated in the trap description above. Ironically, doing so creates an opening large enough for a Medium creature to crawl through near the top of the doorway. The vault itself is in good shape, having been well designed. There are a total of 5 chests in the vault, all of them open.

### Encounter Condition
Tremor 18

### Tactics
N/A

### Treasure
One of these chests is the sister Teleportation Chest to the first one, found in Room A59. Determining which requires a DC14 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Beyond this, all of the chests are empty except for one that holds a small black silk bundle about 1 ft. long. This bundle contains five metal batons with a *continual flame* spell placed on the tip. Although not designed as a weapon, they can be used as such in an emergency (treat them as clubs).

### Scaling
To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the attack bonus of the falling block trap to +9 and the damage to 5d6. To decrease the challenge, reduce the damage to 2d6.

## A68. Collapsed Guard Post

The door to this Room is partially open. Rubble blocks the door, and a DC 14 Strength check is required to push it open. The PCs can smell smoke and burned flesh coming from inside.

> The smell of smoke and charred flesh fills the air. It is not suffocating, but smells awful. Although there has been a partial collapse of the ceiling, which has crushed much of the furniture that was once here, there are still three chairs in one piece. Two bodies lie burned to a crisp along one wall.

### Initial Attitude
N/A

### Encounter
This Room was a guard post a while ago, but the furniture was left behind when the kobolds retreated south. The chairs are unremarkable and made for creatures with shorter build. There is a weapons rack behind the door, holding four rusty spears.

A pair of kobold bodies lie burned, having died from disease — most likely the mold from one of the earlier Rooms. The kobolds set fire to the bodies to kill any infection.
