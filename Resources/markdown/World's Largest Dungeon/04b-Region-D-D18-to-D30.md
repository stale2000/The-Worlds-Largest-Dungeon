# Region D (continued)

## D18. Storage Cave

This thirty-foot egg-shaped room is free of the pervasive fog polluting many of the nearby corridors and rooms. Crates, barrels, boxes and sacks lie in a haphazard jumble. Many of the contents spill out onto the floor, revealing grains, wine bottles, a few weapons and tools. Aside from the flight of a frightened spider, nothing moves.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The renegade derro stored their supplies here until yellow mold became problematic. Chtrax's servants, unable to dislodge the renegade derro, contaminated a small store of supplies with yellow mold spores and placed them in a lightly guarded room for the derro to raid. The renegade derro, thoroughly insane, overlooked how easy it was to gain access to the goods, and in triumph brought them back to Souiji. Placing the purloined swag in their warm storage chamber, they promptly forgot about it. After a few weeks, the yellow mold spores quickly took over the room, killing a few careless derro. Souiji, seeing the gift as another blessing from his goddess, carefully constructed a trap, while removing the salvageable supplies. Now the yellow mold has expanded to cover the entire room, concealed by a permanent minor illusion (he cast it from a stolen scroll), depicting the actual equipment but concealing the threat of the mold.

PCs wishing to disbelieve the illusion must succeed a DC 19 Wisdom save to see the mold fills each 5-ft. space along the perimeter of the Room. PCs touching any of the items disturb the concealed yellow mold, causing a 5-ft. area to burst into a 10-ft. cloud of spores. All PCs in the area of effect must succeed a DC 15 Constitution save to resist the effects of the mold or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. One minute later, regardless of whether the PC saved or not, the victim must succeed a second DC 15 Constitution save or take 2d6 points of Constitution damage.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Derro do not come to this room except to toss more junk inside from a safe distance. Therefore, any noise in this area makes the derro in Room D19 suspicious, causing them to take up defensive positions as described in Room D17, if they had not already done so.

**Treasure:** The mold ruined all of the perishable goods in the room. All of the tools, weapons, and armor are ruined. A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, triggering the mold, uncovers a ceramic bottle. In it is an unlabeled potion of fire resistance. The label, written in Dwarven, identifies the type of potion.

**Scaling:** N/A

## D19. Renegade Derro Warren

This unusually shaped natural cavern has a sour stench of charcoal. The ceiling rises over 60 ft. high, and a cloud of smoke hangs there unmoving. Holes in the floor give off streams of foul smoke, strangely sweet. To the right is a large cleft in the rock, where a few clay pots, crates and barrels clutter the area in a jumble. There is no fog here, and there are no visible exits.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This cave is Souiji's lair and campsite for his loyal renegade derro. When Chtrax seized control over the derro mines for his own purposes, some of the derro refused to serve him. These derro, led by the savant Souiji, fled to the empty mines in the western section of this region. From here, they mount sporadic guerrilla raids to disrupt Chtrax's operations. They have had minimal impact on the efforts, instead drawing formian guards into their complex to fall victim to the nasty traps protecting them.

PCs may believe that because Souiji and his followers fight against Chtrax, they may have an ally here. Nothing is further from the truth. Souiji is a lunatic. He sees the PCs as a threat to his control and eventual power grab.

Souiji is always here. He uses his map of warding to defend his section of the tunnels once per day. He knows he only has a few charges left, and when the map runs dry, so do his defenses. The savant keeps eight derro guards with him at all times. Souiji, paranoid as ever, also cast alarm on Room D19, so any tampering with the door mentally alerts him.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If Souiji is aware of the PCs, as is likely if they enter through Room D17, he orders the elite derro guards to take up positions in the hall and conceal themselves with darkness. Souiji then casts the following spells in this order: shield, spider climb, and resistance. He crawls up the wall to a hidden nook above the entrance to this cave, where he has cover.

The derro in the hall hide in the concealing darkness. When the PCs enter the area, the derro ambush the opponents. The elite derro guards are more frightened by Souiji than they are of the PCs and will fight to the death.

The giants, after Day 2, do not immediately detect this concealed section of tunnels, only discovering it on Day 6. Once discovered, 3 stone giants, a formian taskmaster, 2 dominated destrachan and 3 formian warriors break through the door at Room D18 and attack Souiji and his minions. If the PCs are not present for this confrontation, assume the giants win.

### Map of Warding

> This scroll of vellum is simple and unadorned, creased from folding. Each warding map has 50 charges, just like a wand, and when all 50 charges are used, the map disintegrates. The user can draw on the map with any implement once per day, taking 30 minutes and expending a charge from the item. For the map of warding to work, the map must replicate the layout of the section. At the end of the activation time, the map creates an effect identical to guards and wards (spell save DC 15). The illustrator makes all determinations of the spell as if he had cast the spell himself.

**Treasure:** Piled in the cleft are boxes, barrels and crates all containing dry goods and water. A thorough search of the area, DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, reveals a small cache of gemstones, stolen from the mines. All of the gems are rough cut, but if polished and finished, their value doubles. The stones include the following: irregular freshwater pearl (14 gp), bloodstone (89 gp), amber (109 gp) and a black opal (1,056 gp).

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, give +2 to Souiji's spell save DC and spell attack rolls, and give him an additional 4 sorcery points. To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of elite derro guards from eight to four.

---

## D20. Derro Encampment

### If the miners did not hear the sounds of combat with the ankhegs in Room D13:

Two feeble campfires burning on either side of this cave light the wide, mist-filled room. To the left huddle six blue-skinned dwarves, clearly derro. To your right is a small crowd of dwarves, some with grey features, while others are pale and bald. Only the derro speak to one another, while the dwarves are silent with heads bowed. In the center of the room is a loose pile of large anthropomorphic insect heads, their blank eyes watching the cave's entrance. The room stinks with fear.

### If the PCs encountered the derro in this room in Room D13 instead:

This wide room is quiet. Standing in the shifting mist are six bedraggled and hungry duergar and one slender and bald deep dwarf. All the dwarves wear bloody rags, and most have filthy bandages covering a wound or stump. They watch you with cold eyes and grim expressions.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This room houses the rebel derro mining encampment, consisting of four derro, three duergar, and six deep dwarves. Souiji keeps all derro rebels he does not fully trust with the slaves, forcing them to share living quarters. The savant's suspicions are ungrounded and the product of his insanity; none of these dwarves or derro has the will or the ability to hatch a plot against their renegade master.

The derro collect the heads of formian warriors and workers, dumping them in the middle of this room to serve as a demarcation line the slaves cannot cross. This is an arbitrary border. Neither side is better, and all live in abject squalor.

If the PCs attracted the attention of the derro by their combat with the ankheg in Room D13, then this room houses just the dwarven slaves. All but one of the slaves carries a xill egg in their stomachs, and they know it dooms them, having seen many of their numbers succumb to the hatching. Souiji has promised to cure those slaves who work hard and prove their worth. Derro guards take those slaves meeting his criteria to Room D18, where the guards dump the poor slaves into the yellow mold, Souiji's cure. Even though the slaves have not seen any of their number returned, the other derro claim the savant granted the slaves freedom and healing for their loyalty. Consequently, the slaves are fanatically loyal to the savant and see him as the means for their salvation.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** Shifts change at 12-hour intervals, and the derro and slaves move to Rooms D22, D23 and D24, where they relieve the other derro and their slaves. The shift change takes one minute for the relief to reach the other miners and one minute for the relieved to return to Room D20. During this time, the derro encampment is empty.

If the derro hear the PCs advance, they order the slaves to take up their picks and attack the intruders. Meanwhile, all the derro hide in their darkness effects on the first round, awaiting the opportunity to strike dealing sneak attack damage.

If the PCs did not draw the derro from this room into the fight at Room D13, the derro have disadvantage on their Perception checks, while the slaves are too tired and demoralized to bother listening. Meanwhile, all the derro hide in their darkness effects the first round, awaiting the opportunity to strike, dealing sneak attack damage.

If the PCs defeated the derro from this room in the ankheg battle, the slaves take up their picks and ready themselves for the attack. PCs entering the room have one round to make a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) check to improve the slaves' attitude. If the PCs fail, the dwarf slaves attack, fighting to the death.

Finally, if the PCs do not explore this room until Day 3 or later, they find the bodies of all of the opponents normally encountered here, slaughtered by the giants.

**Treasure:** Aside from a pile of formian heads, there are 4 extra heavy pikes, 2 warhammers and a hand axe in a wheelbarrow, hidden beneath a tarp made of cured yrthak hide (50 gp value).

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add two more derro and give each duergar and deep dwarf a use of the Action Surge ability. To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of derro by two.

---

## D21. Supply Room

The narrow tunnel extends 40 ft before sharply turning to the right, where it ends in a small cave, no larger than 10 ft wide, filled with junk. Bars of corroded silver, bolts of stained cloth, axe, hammers, picks and other mining equipment fills the outer edge of the room, leaving a narrow island in the sea of trash. There are no visible exits, and the room is otherwise unoccupied.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** The derro and slave miners, from Room D20 and Rooms D22 through D24, use this cave for storage. Most of the equipment here is worthless, except the silver bars and a few hidden items. The derro do not guard this room and only come here to drop off broken pieces of equipment or unusable items acquired from a raid.

**Encounter Condition:** [Deep Darkness]

**Tactics:** PCs exploring this room do not draw attention to themselves unless they make an inordinate amount of racket, causing a derro from Room D20 to investigate. This is a good place for the PCs to rest, heal and recover spells, with only a 10% chance each day of a Random Encounter.

**Treasure:** The piles of equipment contain all manner of useless items, including, but not restricted to the following: hempen rope 500 ft., seven barrels of tepid water, an empty bucket, six hammers, ten miner's picks, four spades and a scrap of parchment providing a rough sketch of Room D32 through Room D51, though there are no notes, scale or any useful information aside from just the layout. In addition, there are 10 1-lb. trade bars of truesilver, worth 50 gp each, wrapped in treated Formian chitin to protect them. If mortals handle the bars, their touch transmutes the metal into mundane silver. Finally, buried beneath the equipment are the following items, recognized as unusable by the rebels: a divine scroll of hold person and one dose of dust of dryness.

**Scaling:** N/A

### Dwarven Allies

The PCs could befriend and gain the help of liberated slaves throughout the region. Having 20 or more dwarven soldiers at their sides could mean a significant difference in the survival rate throughout the adventure. However, before the PCs build an army of ex-slaves to overthrow the evil masters, there are a few issues to consider first.

**Xill Eggs:** There is a 25% chance any given duergar or deep dwarf carries a xill egg. As the process of gaining the egg is maddening, along with the realization of death's immediacy, many dwarves go insane. Consequently, add +20 to the alignment roll if the dwarf has been infected. See Xill Eggs and the Derro above for more details.

**Alignment:** Unless the PCs are of matching alignment, they may have some difficulties convincing the slaves to join their cause, by dint of alignment alone. Deep dwarves are "often" lawful neutral or just neutral, making them more amenable to the PCs actions than the "usually" lawful evil duergar (although a Lawful Evil dwarf might be happy to follow a strong leader who promises revenge). To determine the alignment of a particular liberated slave, roll on the following tables.

| D100 | Deep Dwarf | D100 | Duergar |
|:----:|:-----------|:----:|:--------|
| 01-25 | Lawful Neutral | 01-70 | Lawful Evil |
| 26-50 | Neutral | 71-78 | Lawful Neutral |
| 51-58 | Lawful Good | 79 | Lawful Good |
| 59-66 | Lawful Evil | 80-86 | Neutral Evil |
| 67-74 | Neutral Good | 87-92 | Neutral |
| 75-82 | Neutral Evil | 93 | Neutral Good |
| 83-90 | Chaotic Good | 94-96 | Chaotic Evil |
| 91-98 | Chaotic Neutral | 97-99 | Chaotic Neutral |
| 99+ | Chaotic Evil | 100+ | Chaotic Good |

**Loyalty:** Chtrax uses propaganda and fear to coerce the slaves to work hard and face the innumerable dangers of these mines. As a result, most of the slaves are blind to the deception of their xill and formian masters. To enlist a dwarf as an ally, a PC must make a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check. Make these checks in secret. Dwarves whose attitudes change to helpful are willing to join the PCs. Dwarves whose attitudes are friendly may offer advice. Other results indicate the dwarves do not help. If more slaves are helpful than the rest, all of the dwarves present help the PCs, though those whose attitudes are unfriendly or worse betray the PCs and their traitorous brethren at their nearest convenience. If the PCs are willing to arm the slaves, give the PC making the Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check advantage on the roll.

**Possessions:** Most dwarves carry light picks and hammers, wear no armor, and have rags for clothes. It is up to the PCs to outfit these allies adequately if they wish their assistance.

**Combat:** Recordkeeping for combats involving 20 or more combatants can be nightmarish for a GM. You could simply roll for groups of slaves, pooling their health and reducing their damage as you might for a swarm. You could gloss over damage, and have the allies aid cinematically, describing many more enemies than a room possesses, and the allies hold them off while the PCs combat the creatures actually mentioned in the Encounter description. Finally, you could simply disallow allies from joining the PCs in combat, providing only advice, rest, etc.

## D22. Miners

### When the PCs enter the tunnel leading to Room D22:

The darkened tunnel features the same clinging mists so pervasive in these tunnels and continues deep into the darkness. Ahead, clangs of tools on stone sound and echo down the tunnel. Amidst the calls of the hammers and picks, you hear voices, and then a weird humming noise jarring your bones. Just as soon as the noise starts, the roar of crumbling rock masks it.

### When the PCs approach the entrance:

This gloomy cavern is clearly a mining work site. Derro overseers monitor the efforts of several slaves who chip away the dense rock in the many shallow mines. The source of the unusual noise is clear, now, as a derro with a spear prods a chained destrachan toward another small tunnel. The room is dark but lacks the clinging mists of the tunnel.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** This cave is the heart of the renegade derro miners. Souiji, though unaware of Chtrax's true goals, knows the xill searches for something in the mines. In a vain effort to defeat his nemesis, Souiji directs the derro under his command to mine the tunnels in the hopes they can beat Chtrax to his goal. Given their position in the complex, the derro have thus far broken through the outer walls, releasing lava into the tunnels (see Rooms D11 and D14). This has collapsed several tunnels, killing many slaves and derro, and the derro are now likely to break through to some of the rooms under the xill's control. Two days after the PCs first enter this complex, the rebel derro break through to Room D27 as described in the opening sidebar.

Before this time, however, five derro overseers command five duergar and four deep dwarves to work the tunnels in the Room. In addition to the slave forces, the derro also control a moody destrachan, using it to break up particularly dense sections of rock. There are two miners per alcove, including Room D23. A bulette and its derro handler work the tunnel at Room D24.

**Encounter Condition:** Echoes 8

**Tactics:** The derro command the slaves, whose loyalty is thanks to Souiji's promises (see Room D20 for details as to why), to attack the PCs. The handler in Room D24 releases his pet bulette as soon as combat breaks out in Room D22. The derro use poisoned crossbow bolts from positions of darkness. The destrachan uses the PCs attack to get revenge on its captors. Each round it is 50% likely to attack the derro and their slaves or the PCs. If the PCs attack the destrachan, it focuses its attack on them exclusively. If combat goes against the miners, dwarf slaves fall back to the two tunnels at room D23 in an effort to lure them to an unstable corridor. All of the miners fight to the death.

On Day 2, the slaves break through the wall to Room D27, creating a permanent connection between the two rooms. The stone giant chief invades the Old Mines with 3 regular stone giants, a formian taskmaster and 3 formian warriors to destroy the problematic derro. See Room O27 for more details.

If explored on Day 3 or later, the room holds nothing but corpses.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, add one destrachan and replace the deep dwarf slaves with duergar fighters. To decrease the challenge, replace the duergar miners with deep dwarf miners.

---

## D23. Unstable Tunnel

This tunnel ends after 15 ft Spider web cracks cover both walls and ceiling here.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A or Hostile

**Encounter:** Two slaves, a duergar and deep dwarf normally work this tunnel. The dwarves have warned their masters of the danger in the tunnels, but the derro make them work it anyway. Any loud noise, such as that created by fireball or ice storm, causes the tunnel to collapse. Should the ceiling collapse, the cave-in deals 24 (8d6) points of bludgeoning damage, or half on a successful DC 15 Dexterity save.

A PC succeeding a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) can identify weakened ceilings for what they are.

**Encounter Condition:** Poor Footing 4, Hazardous Footing 18, Tremors 18

**Tactics:** If combat goes against the miners in Room D22, a slave retreats to this tunnel in a mad act of sacrifice. Should the PCs follow, a derro uses its psychic thunderwave to collapse the tunnel, bringing it down on himself and the PCs. The dwarves realize they are doomed, and feel their loyalty lies with Souiji.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N.A

---

## D24. Chained Bulette and Its Master

### If combat does not occur in Room D22:

A cloud of dust and the sounds of scraping pours out of this tunnel. Through the flying debris, a large, armored beast claws at the rock, while an exceptionally mad derro looks on, a wide smile staining his face. Neither the beast nor the derro notice you.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** A bulette and its derro handler work this short tunnel. The derro handler has a tenuous control over the monster, forced to devote his entire attention on goading the bulette to dig through the derro's use of the animal friendship spell. The noise the monster makes as it digs is deafening, so the derro is unlikely to hear any disturbances or disruptions.

The bulette is loud in its work, deafening all creatures within 10 ft. for as long as they remain in the area. Note, deafened PCs suffer a -4 penalty to initiative checks, automatically fail Wisdom (Perception) checks, and have a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises 8, Echoes 4

**Tactics:** If combat occurs in Room D22, allow the derro handler a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice each round. Should he succeed this check, he turns from the bulette to investigate. Allow the bulette a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice when something breaks the handler's attention. If the monster succeeds, it attacks its handler and leaps into the thickest group of combatants, killing PCs, derro and slaves alike.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, give the handler an additional attack and disallow the bulette from attacking its allies. To decrease the challenge, have the bulette immediately notice the handler's distraction. Instead of having it enter the melee, it burrows away after killing its former master.

---

## D25-D31. The Approach

Rooms D25 through D31 serve as the only path to the Chtrax enclave. A mixture of lairs, checkpoints and even a foundry, this path is exceedingly dangerous. It is fraught with hostile derro, formians and giants, and the PCs' successes or failures here determine the reactions of the rest of this Region. Yet, despite this section's importance to Chtrax's overall plan, his bulwarks are failing as evidenced by the corpses of derro in Room D25 and the malfunctioning trap at Room D26.

There are far fewer traps in these sections, as Chtrax's resources are flagging, forcing him to rely on the stone giant chief to defend the back door to his operations. Still, the xill master barely trusts the giant, so he commands a myrmarch to dispatch regular formian patrols through these areas. These threats, along with the occasional creeping xill, combine to make the approach a dangerous path.

If the PCs have not vanquished the renegade derro in the Old Mines by Day 2, the miners in D22 break through the wall to Room D27. There, the stone giant chief leads an expedition to kill the rogue derro, bringing 3 more stone giants, a formian taskmaster and 3 formian warriors to the fight, leaving this room empty of hostiles until Day 4, when the stone giant returns. If the PCs have still not defeated the stone giant chieftain by Day 6, he returns to the Old Mines to kill Souiji.

When the PCs first enter this section, they must succeed a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the loud slamming noise caused by the malfunctioning trap in Room D26. From Room D27, they must succeed a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the hammering noises from the factory at Room D30.

All rooms here are cloistered unless specified otherwise. Throughout this area are hewn stone walls with average ceiling heights of 30 ft. in rooms and 15 ft. in tunnels. Debris in the tunnels gathers at the edges in collections of small rocks, trash, scraps of cloth and luminescent fungi. The scent of smoke lingers in the air and wisps of it are visible near the ceilings.

### Random Encounters

Roll for a Random Encounter once per hour.

| D20 | Encounter |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1-2 | Fissures of superheated steam erupt from the floor targeting a random PC and dealing 10 (3d6) points of fire damage. DC 15 Dexterity save for half damage. |
| 3-4 | Tremors shake the corridor, causing fine streams of dust to spill from cracks in the ceiling. |
| 5-9 | Nothing |
| 10-12 | Renegade derro hunters, one formian taskmaster and 1d6 formian warriors, move toward the Old Mines, searching for renegade derro. Treat this roll as "nothing" in Rooms D27-D30. |
| 13 | An escaped and malicious destrachan waits in darkness for prey. |
| 14-17 | Two formian warriors and two gorgons patrol the tunnels, defending against intruders and renegades. Treat this roll as "nothing" in Rooms D27-D30. |
| 18 | A stone giant tosses boulders down the tunnel halls. Treat this roll as "nothing" in Rooms D25 and D26. |
| 19 | 1d4 xill hunting for hosts. |
| 20 | The PCs stumble upon a Glyph of Warding (Blast) trap. After the trap is triggered, tremors shake the corridor. |

## D25. Played Out Mine

Rounding the corner, you come upon a grisly heap of corpses. Worse, all have open cavities in their chests. Bloody footprints mark the passage leading back in the direction you came before they fade away completely.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This was once a derro checkpoint, responsible for defending the approach from intruders. Chtrax implanted his eggs in these guards and a couple of days ago they hatched. The surviving derro fled, but the renegade derro or traps killed them all.

Searching the bodies uncovers precious little. Someone already looted the bodies, so they have no treasure. A DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies their deaths were caused by the hatching of xill eggs. There is nothing else that is of interest. From here the PCs can hear the malfunctioning trap (smashing stones) in Room D26.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** N/A

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## D26. Malfunctioning Trap

The source of the awful din comes from this 30-ft.-long corridor. From the ceiling, a huge 5-ft.-by-5-ft.-by 10 ft. stone block drops and slams into the floor making a terrible racket, sending clouds of rock dust in the air. Soon after it falls, it will rise back up into the darkness, while another block falls, randomly. Bloody stains, broken bits of bone and teeth, and several flattened corpses litter the floor here.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This trap is broken. When working properly, mere passage down the tunnel would trigger the trap, causing blocks to fall onto unsuspecting intruders. A secret lever on either side of the trap, when pulled, would disable it. Now, however, the levers on both sides are broken and the trap triggers at random. For four hours each day, the trap stops functioning, allowing passage into the Great Hall.

Each round, roll 1d12 to determine which 5 ft. section malfunctions and triggers the trap automatically. In addition, whenever a PC stands in any of the 5 ft. sections of the hall, there is a 50% chance for the trap to trigger.

**Falling Block Trap.** Detect: DC 25 Wisdom (Perception); Disable: DC 20 Dexterity; Each square in the tunnel has a 50% chance of triggering each round. +10 to hit, 12 (4d6) bludgeoning damage.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** No creatures will come to investigate the trap. However, if the PCs disable the trap, 1d3 stone giants from Room D27 (unless it is Day 2 or 6) come to investigate the odd silence.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the trap trigger 75% of the time and have the blocks deal 6d6 points of damage. To decrease the challenge, have the sections trigger their respective traps just once.

---

## D27. Stone Giant Quarters

This large cavern is nearly 40 ft. across, with a dripping ceiling 50 ft. above. Boulders litter the floor, along with the skins of an unspecified enormous reptile. Through the gloom, you think you see blankets, a few overlarge crates and a fire pit radiating light.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** This large cave houses the stone giants in service to the xill. Most times Talig and 1d6 stone giants recline here, relaxing and entertaining themselves while biding their time before rising against their newest masters. While they wait, they frequently kill lone derro in revenge for their years of captivity and hide the bodies under a pile of loose rocks. These giants are not immediately hostile, though they attack if they sense an easy opponent for the sheer enjoyment of the act.

The stone giants have maintained a presence in these mines. Before Chtrax, the derro had enslaved them as a labor force. When Chtrax assumed control, however, he approached them as equals instead of in the more traditional hierarchy of a master-slave relationship. The xill approached the elder stone giant, Talig, and lied, requesting the giant's assistance in recovering a lost artifact. The giant agreed on the promise of power in return and seeing the puny outsider as no immediate threat. The stone giant elder offered his stone giant minions to serve as laborers and guards to survey the progress of the artifact's recovery. Talig ordered his minions to seize the object as soon as the derro and their workers uncover it. By positioning stone giants throughout the complex, Talig expects an easy victory over the xill. Until Chtrax recovers the artifact, the giants are content to work, watch and wait.

**Encounter Condition:** Distracting Noises 7, Echoes 10

**Tactics:** The giants are wary of trespassers, like solitary derro, moving to and from Room D28 through Room D26, so when the PCs enter this room, the giants know. While not overtly hostile, because they feel the PCs do not represent a threat to them, they are suspicious. They watch from hidden positions among the rocks. If the party is small, they attack by hurling boulders until the PCs close. Otherwise, they allow well-armed PCs to pass unmolested. If the PCs explore this room, however, Talig steps into view and questions why they intrude. Respectful PCs succeeding at a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check improve the giants' attitudes to being friendly. If they manage this, the giants give them the following information if asked. If the PCs succeed a DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check, the giants give the following information freely. Otherwise, they simply tell the PCs to move on or die.

> A canny, red-skinned devil named Chtrax controls the mines now with the help of formians, orderly insect men. He commands the surviving derro, their slaves and even our brethren to dig into the depths to reach some lost artifact. We are not certain as to what this artifact is or what it does, but Chtrax is adamant about retrieving it. While we serve him now, it is out of convenience. Ahead is the Great Hall. There the slaves process silver for tools and other equipment. Beyond the hall are the deeper mines. It is dangerous there, certainly no place for a group such as yourselves.

The giants have no interest in helping the PCs, and if requested, they refuse. If the PCs are respectful, the giants let them pass freely. Should combat occur, Talig takes cover behind the myriad of huge rock piles, hurling rocks at the PC spellcasters. The other giants in the room close after one round of ranged attacks. These giants fight to the death.

If the PCs kill the giants and leave their carcasses in the open, the Great Hall has a 20% chance each day of going on alert (see below).

Depending on developments in other parts of this region, this room may be empty. The renegade derro, if undefeated, punch through the wall on Day 2. The giants here react by gathering a force and wiping out the rebels, leaving this room empty. The chieftain returns with 1d3 stone giants on Day 3, watchful of the new exit. On Day 6, the chieftain, if still alive, goes back into the Old Mines to kill Souiji.

### Slimy Doom

**Slimy Doom.** Contact with the substance requires a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to resist. Incubation period of 1 day, 1d4 Constitution damage.

**Treasure:** The giants hide their accumulated wealth with the bodies of the slain derro in a rock pile. Clearing the rock requires 2 hours of hard labor and exposes diggers to Slimy Doom, carried by the rotting derro. PCs digging must succeed a DC 14 Constitution save or contract the disease.

PCs succeeding in excavating the treasure find 1,567 gp divided somewhat equally between three leather sacks. In a fourth bag are 6 gems, consisting of a tourmaline (800 gp), 2 red spinell (700 gp, 600 gp), zircon (70 gp), onyx (50 gp) and a small shard of obsidian (8 gp).

Each stone giant, including the chieftain carries a large sack holding 2d12 throwing rocks and 1d4+6 mundane items.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, have the stone giants' attitudes start as Hostile. To decrease the challenge, reduce the number of additional stone giants to 2.

## D28. Sounds of Industry

Weird lights and ghastly shadows play on the walls of this 30 ft. long tunnel. Pounding noise of metal clanging on metal echo up ahead, making the tunnel inordinately loud. Otherwise, the tunnel is as dark as it is ordinary.

**Initial Attitude:** N/A

**Encounter:** This tunnel leads to the sentry post at Room D29. There are no creatures here and the tunnel is debris-free. PCs clearly hear the sound of metalworking and smelting coming from ahead in Room D30.

There are too many tracks here to get an accurate read on the types and numbers of creatures travelling through this tunnel.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** If the PCs retreat from the formian and gorgon guards in Room D29, and if they did not befriend or encounter the giants in Room D27, the formians and the stone giants trap the PCs here, flanking them.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** N/A

## D29. Guards

The tunnel takes a sharp turn to the left, opening into a small room serving as an antechamber for a larger cavern. Mounted on two armor-plated bulls with green mist curling from their nostrils and dead empty eyes, are two insect men, each holding a guisarme.

**Initial Attitude:** Unfriendly

**Encounter:** Functioning as guards overseeing traffic coming from Room D27 and beyond to enter Rooms D30 and the Great Hall are two formian warriors mounted on gorgons. These creatures are vigilant about their duties, allowing only stone giants, derro, and dwarves to pass into D30 without question. They are watchful for intruders, cautious about creatures they do not recognize and readily attack any who threaten the complex.

**Encounter Condition:** N/A

**Tactics:** PCs have 1 round to make their case to these guards to avert combat, by succeeding a DC 25 Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) check. PCs suffer a -5 penalty, as the guards are exceptionally suspicious. If combat sounded from Room D27, the guards attack without question.

One gorgon uses its breath weapon, while the other tramples into combat. The formian warriors attack PC using their polearms. On the second round of combat, one of the mounted formians urges its mount to charge surviving PCs, while the other uses its breath weapon attack. Thereafter, the formians and gorgons use charge attacks and attacks with reach weapons until the gorgons' respective breath weapons recharge.

Combat with any formian alerts all formians in the region due to their hive mind ability, though only those nearest the threat respond. Consequently, fighting the formians here alerts those in the factory and the Great Hall.

**Treasure:** N/A

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the formian warriors' hit points by 10 each. To decrease the challenge, reduce the guards to two formian warriors and one gorgon.

## D30. Factory

This gallery houses a major operation. Scores of derro work at various tables and forges, constructing weapons, tools, carts and rails. More insect men stand at locations throughout the room, overseeing the operation. In the center of the room is a stone golem, obviously built from petrified humanoids. A crucible, where liquid iron and other metals bubble, spitting sparks and belching toxic fumes, lights the room with an inconsistent warmth. Ahead, another tunnel leads to a large cavern with several buildings and attendant toiling slaves.

**Initial Attitude:** Hostile

**Encounter:** The factory is where the derro work raw materials into useable items. Here they forge tools, weapons, ore cars, tracks, spikes, and braces for tunnel ceilings out of the corrupted truesilver and iron. Twenty infected derro work in this room. Chtrax does not trust the slaves to handle the viral manufacturing needed to keep his excavation moving. As a result, only derro work here and only under constant guard of six formian warriors and a stone golem, to ensure against sabotage or intrusion.

The formians are wary of intruders. They question any non-derro entering the room. Unless a formian, stone giant or Chtrax accompany and vouch for the PC, the formians attack.

**Encounter Condition:** Hostile

**Tactics:** If PCs battle the sentries in Room D29, the golem and half of the formians move to Room D29 to aid the guards, while the remaining formians go to Room D31 and ready an action to tip the crucible of molten ore to spill into the room once all the PCs enter. The derro climb on top of their worktables, using darkness for concealment and level crossbows at the room's entrance, firing as soon as they see the PCs.

When the PCs enter the room, the formians and the derro at room D31 tip the crucible, spilling liquid metal over the whole floor. PCs on foot take 8d6 points of fire damage each round they remain in the liquid metal, no save. The derro avoid the damage because the worktables hang on chains suspended from the ceiling. The metal cools after 20 minutes. The formians in room D32 hold their positions, waiting for the intruders to enter the Great Hall.

**Treasure:** This room is home to over one hundred hammers, picks, shovels and an assortment of mining tools, though none are valuable enough to warrant plundering. There are also 24 short swords, 15 warhammers and 18 light maces. Finally, there are over 300 spikes, three huge ore carts, and 200 ft. of linear track.

**Scaling:** To increase the challenge of this encounter, increase the number of wailing golems by one. To decrease the challenge, remove the formian warriors.
